RISK FACTORS\nRisk Factor Summary\nThe following summary highlights the material risks that may affect our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects, as more fully described in the pages that follow this summary.\n\u00b7 The COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect our business.\n\u00b7 Vaccines and other treatments authorized or approved for COVID-19 may decrease or eliminate hospitalizations for COVID-19 patients which would negatively impact the need for lenzilumab.\n\u00b7 If our competitors receive FDA approval for treatments or vaccines for COVID-19, our commercial opportunity may be reduced or eliminated.\n\u00b7 We have a history of operating losses and we may never become profitable.\n\u00b7 We are substantially dependent on third parties to plan and conduct the referenced studies and clinical trials in our development pipeline, to manufacture and to commercialize and distribute our product candidate.\n\u00b7 If we are unable to obtain additional financing to fund our operations, we may be unable to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\n\u00b7 The scientific rationale behind the hypothesis that GM-CSF is a cause of the cytokine storm that leads to adverse results in COVID-19 patients is still being tested and may not prove accurate.\n\u00b7 We may not be able to develop, obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize, any of our product candidates, and our product candidates are at an early stage of development.\n\u00b7 The adoption of CAR-T therapies as the potential standard of care for treatment of certain cancers is uncertain and, if not adopted as anticipated, the market for lenzilumab may not develop.\n\u00b7 We may not ultimately qualify for or benefit from various regulatory incentives.\n\u00b7 If our existing or future collaborators cease development efforts under our collaboration agreements (including our agreement with Kite and the IMPACT partnership), or if any of those agreements are terminated or are ultimately not successful, our business could be adversely affected.\n\u00b7 We have relied and may in the future rely on third parties to conduct investigator-sponsored trials (\u201cISTs\u201d) of our products, which affords the investigators the ability to retain significant control over the design and conduct of the trials, as well as the use of the data generated from their efforts.\n\u00b7 Our ability to pursue our clinical development programs could be delayed or unsuccessful and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates when expected or at all.\n\u00b7 We may experience delays in commencing or conducting our clinical trials, in receiving data from third parties or in the continuation or completion of clinical testing.\n\u00b7 Our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation, compliance with which is costly and time consuming, may cause unanticipated delays, or may prevent the receipt of the required approvals to commercialize our product candidates.\n\u00b7 The results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials are not always predictive of future results.\n\u00b7 We face risks related to the development, manufacturing and distribution of our product candidates, which may delay or impair our ability to obtain an EUA or BLA or to successfully commercialize any FDA-approved product candidate. These risks include manufacturing delays due to displacement of scheduled production at certain of our Contract Manufacturing Organizations (CMO) as mandated from Rated Orders issued under the Defense Production Act (DPA) or the shortage of raw materials and critical components we are experiencing and expect to continue to experience relating to Rated Orders and increased demand for production capability from others at our CMOs.\n\u00b7 Interim, \u201ctop-line\u201d or preliminary data from our clinical trials may not be favorable and may change as more patient data become available and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data.\n\u00b7 We may be unable to accurately predict demand for lenzilumab and to accurately forecast any sales.\n\u00b7 The regulatory pathway for lenzilumab is highly dynamic and continues to evolve and may result in unexpected or unforeseen challenges.\n\u00b7 Even if EUA or regulatory approval is received for our product candidates, the later discovery of previously unknown problems associated with the use of any product candidate may adversely affect our business.\n\u00b7 We face risks associated with clinical operations abroad.\n\u00b7 If we fail to attract and retain key management and clinical development personnel, or if the attention of such personnel is diverted, we may be unable to successfully manage our business.\n\u00b7 If our competitors develop treatments for the target indications of our product candidates that are approved more quickly, marketed more successfully or are demonstrated to be safer or more effective than our product candidates, or if FDA approves generic or biosimilar competitors to our products post-approval, our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated.\n\u00b7 Any FDA approved product candidate may not achieve broad market acceptance among physicians, healthcare payers and the medical community.\n\u00b7 Reimbursement may be limited or unavailable in certain market segments for our product candidates, and governments may impose price controls.\n\u00b7 We outsource our sales and marketing capabilities and rely on agreements with third parties to market and sell any product candidates we may successfully develop.\n\u00b7 We face potential product liability exposure and, if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability for a product candidate and may have to limit its commercialization.\n\u00b7 Our employees and consultants may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards.\n\u00b7 We may encounter difficulties in managing our growth and expanding our operations successfully.\n\u00b7 Even if we are able to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, we will continue to be subject to ongoing and extensive regulatory requirements.\n\u00b7 Our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to certain limitations.\n\u00b7 Currently pending, threatened or future litigation or governmental proceedings or inquiries could result in material adverse consequences, including judgments or settlements.\n\u00b7 We may not be able to identify or complete various strategic alternatives, and future acquisitions of and investments in new businesses could impact our business and financial condition.\n\u00b7 If we fail to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or secure rights to patents of others, the value of our intellectual property rights would diminish.\n\u00b7 If we infringe on the rights of third parties, we could be prevented from selling products and be forced to defend against litigation and pay damages.\n\u00b7 A significant portion of our total outstanding shares are eligible to be sold into the market, which may affect the market price of our common stock.\n\u00b7 Our executive officers, directors and principal stockholders, if they choose to act together, will continue to have the ability to significantly influence all matters submitted to stockholders for approval.\n\u00b7 Our common stock may be delisted if we fail to comply with ongoing Nasdaq Capital Market standards.\n\u00b7 Raising additional funds by issuing securities or through licensing or lending arrangements may cause dilution to our existing stockholders or restrict or otherwise affect our operations.\n\u00b7 Our stock price is volatile, and purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other filings we have made and will make in the future with the SEC, you should carefully consider the following risk factors and uncertainties, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nRisks Related to COVID-19 and Lenzilumab\nThe fluid and unpredictable nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, which began in late 2019 and has spread worldwide, may affect our ability to conduct the clinical trial with Kite and the IMPACT partnership, delay the initiation of planned and future clinical trials, disrupt regulatory activities, or have other adverse effects on our business and operations. In addition, this pandemic has caused substantial volatility in the financial markets and may adversely impact economies worldwide, both of which could result in adverse effects on our business and operations.\nIn December 2019, an outbreak of the respiratory illness COVID-19 caused by a strain of novel coronavirus, SARS-Cov-2, was first reported in China. The COVID-19 outbreak has spread worldwide, causing many governments to implement measures to slow the spread of the outbreak through quarantines, strict travel restrictions, heightened border scrutiny, and other measures. COVID-19 infections are widespread and as of February 26, 2021 in the United States, there were over 28 million cases, nearly 1.8 million hospitalizations and over 510 thousand deaths. Several vaccines have been developed which show efficacy in excess of 90%, however the slow rollout of inoculations and the emergence of numerous COVID-19 variants lead us to believe the need for therapeutics to treat COVID-19 currently exists and will continue to exist for the next several years. The outbreak and government measures taken in response have had a significant impact, both direct and indirect, on businesses and commerce, as worker shortages have occurred; supply chains have been disrupted; facilities and production have been suspended; and demand for certain goods and services, such as medical services and supplies, has spiked, while demand for other goods and services, such as travel, has fallen. The future progression of the outbreak and its effects on our business and operations are uncertain.\nWe and our third-party contract research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d) clinical sites and CMOs may experience disruptions in supply of product candidates and/or procuring items that are essential for our research and development activities, including raw materials used in the manufacturing of our product candidates, medical and laboratory supplies used in our clinical trials or preclinical studies or animals that are used for preclinical testing, in each case, for which there may be shortages because of ongoing efforts to address the outbreak. These delays have impacted our overall manufacturing supply chain operations to date, and we continue to explore back up or alternative sources of supply, any future disruption in the supply chain from the COVID-19 outbreak, or any continued outbreak could have a material adverse impact on our clinical trial plans and business operations.\nAdditionally, we have enrolled, and will seek to enroll, patients in our clinical trials at sites located in many areas affected by COVID-19 and, as a result, our trials may be impacted. In addition, even if sites are actively recruiting, we may face difficulties recruiting or retaining patients in our ongoing and planned clinical trials if patients are affected by the virus or are fearful of visiting or traveling to our clinical trial sites because of the outbreak. Prolonged delays or closure to enrollment in our trials or patient discontinuations could have a material adverse impact on our clinical trial plans and timelines.\nIn addition, our ability to collect all data requested of patients enrolled in our clinical trials during this pandemic is being impacted to varying degrees by COVID-19. Clinical trial data collection generally continues for each of our clinical trials, but at a slower pace, and in some instances, we encounter disruption of collection of complete study data. This could have a material adverse impact on our data analysis.\nThe response to the COVID-19 pandemic may redirect resources with respect to regulatory and intellectual property matters in a way that would adversely impact our ability to progress regulatory approvals and protect our intellectual property. In addition, we may face impediments to regulatory meetings and approvals due to measures intended to limit in-person interactions.\nAny negative impact that the COVID-19 outbreak has on the ability of our suppliers to provide materials for our product candidates or on recruiting or retaining patients in our clinical trials or our ability to collect patient data could cause costly delays to clinical trial activities, which could adversely affect our ability to obtain regulatory approval for and to commercialize our product candidates, increase our operating expenses, and have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Furthermore, any negative impact that the outbreak has on the ability of our CROs to deliver data sets and execute on experimentation could cause substantial delays for our discovery activities and materially impact our ability to fuel our pipeline with new product candidates.\nAny negative impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has on recruiting or retaining patients in our clinical trials, obtaining complete clinical trial data or on the ability of our suppliers to provide materials for our product candidates could cause additional delays to clinical trial and developmental activities, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to obtain regulatory approval for and to commercialize our product candidates, increase our operating expenses, affect our ability to raise additional capital, and have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has already caused significant volatility in the financial markets, and may continue to cause such disruptions, which could impact our ability to raise additional funds through public offerings and may also impact the volatility of our stock price and trading in our stock. Moreover, the pandemic has also significantly impacted economies worldwide, which could result in adverse effects on our business and operations. We cannot be certain what the overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will be on our business. It has the potential to adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nIf our competitors develop and receive FDA approval for treatments or vaccines for COVID-19, our commercial opportunity may be reduced or eliminated.\nOn October 22, 2020, FDA approved remdesivir for use in adult and certain pediatric patients for the treatment of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization. Baricitinib has also been approved for use with remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19. Several neutralizing antibodies have been approved to prevent progression in the early stages of infection. Three vaccines have been authorized by the FDA with efficacy rates ranging from 66% to 90%. There are numerous other companies working on therapies to treat COVID-19 and/or vaccines to prevent or treat COVID-19. If additional competing therapies are approved, and/or a safe, efficacious, accessible preventative vaccine is approved, such approval could have a material adverse impact on our ability to commercialize lenzilumab as a therapy for COVID-19. The speed at which all parties are acting to create and test many treatments and vaccines for COVID-19 is unusual and evolving or changing plans or priorities within the FDA and other branches of the U.S. government involved in the fight against the pandemic, including changes based on new knowledge of COVID-19, new COVID-19 variants and how the disease affects the human body, may significantly affect the regulatory timeline for lenzilumab. In addition, there are numerous clinical trial programs in progress for COVID-19 therapies which are all competing for largely the same patient population for enrollment. This problem is exacerbated by changing rates of infection and spread, which make it challenging to ensure there are sufficient centers for the ACTIV-5 trial in areas with sufficient potential patient populations. Results from clinical testing may raise new questions and require us to redesign proposed clinical trials. Many of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater scientific, research, and product development capabilities, as well as greater financial, marketing, sales and human resources capabilities than we do. In addition, many specialized biotechnology firms have formed collaborations with large, established companies to support the research, development and commercialization of products that may be competitive with ours.\nThe scientific rationale behind the hypothesis that GM-CSF is a cause of the cytokine storm that leads to adverse results in COVID-19 patients is still being tested and may not prove accurate.\nThe hypothesis that elevated GM-CSF levels may contribute to cytokine storm-induced immune mechanisms that places patients at greater risk of ICU admission and mortality with the current pandemic strain of coronavirus is unproven. Certain data are the subject of pre-publication papers that have not been peer-reviewed and may not be substantiated. If this hypothesis is not ultimately proven through clinical trials which are underway, the potential for lenzilumab to play a meaningful role in a COVID-19 therapy likely would decrease or be eliminated. We cannot assure you that our exploratory efforts in this respect will be fruitful.\nWe face risks related to the development, manufacturing and distribution of lenzilumab as a treatment for COVID-19, which has not been granted an EUA or approved by FDA and has not been proven through a randomized double-blind placebo clinical trial to be safe or effective for any use.\nWe have completed enrollment in a Phase 3 multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, clinical trial of lenzilumab as a potential treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia. However, there is no assurance of favorable results from our clinical trial, or future clinical trials including the NIH sponsored ACTIV-5/BET, or that our Phase 3 clinical trial will be finalized in the currently anticipated timeline or at all.\nIt is also possible that FDA and other regulatory authorities may not grant an EUA or subsequently approve lenzilumab for the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia, or that any such EUA or approval, if granted, may have significant limitations on its use. Three COVID-19 vaccines have been authorized by the FDA with efficacy over 90%. The inoculation rollout has been slow but widespread uptake of a safe, effective, scalable and affordable vaccine also will have a negative impact on the demand for lenzilumab over the long term, even if an EUA or approval were issued. As a result, we may never successfully commercialize lenzilumab in COVID-19 or realize a return on our significant investment in the development, supply, and commercialization of lenzilumab for this purpose.\nFurthermore, even if an EUA were granted to permit lenzilumab to be commercialized for use in the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia, the authorization would be temporary and might be expressly conditioned or limited by FDA. An EUA does not take the place of the formal BLA submission, review and approval process. While there are ongoing clinical trials to evaluate the safety clinical profile and the efficacy of lenzilumab, there is no assurance of favorable results from any ongoing or future clinical trials, or that one or more of such trials will be completed in the currently anticipated timelines or at all. It is also possible that FDA and other regulatory authorities may not approve lenzilumab for the treatment of COVID-19, or that any marketing approvals, if granted, may have significant limitations on its use. Further, we may make a strategic decision to discontinue development of lenzilumab in this indication if other parties are successful in developing a more effective treatment for COVID-19. As a result, we may never successfully commercialize lenzilumab for use in COVID-19 patients.\nManufacturing problems at our third-party manufacturers or their requirements to displace our reserved manufacturing slots to comply with government orders could cause inventory shortages and delay or impair our ability to obtain an EUA or BLA or other regulatory approval or delay shipments of lenzilumab for commercial use, which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe believe that our ability to obtain an EUA and, ultimately, a BLA to permit lenzilumab to be used commercially for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia depends at least in part on our ability to demonstrate to FDA that we will be able to scale the manufacturing to produce a sufficient quantity of dosages to begin to address the potential demand for the product. We have contracted and expect to continue to contract with third-party manufacturers to produce lenzilumab. We depend on these third parties to perform the manufacturing of lenzilumab effectively, timely, and in compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices (\u201cGMP\u201d), which are extensive regulations governing manufacturing processes, stability testing, record-keeping and quality standards as defined by FDA. Similar regulations are in effect in other jurisdictions.\nOur complete reliance on third-party manufacturers to produce lenzilumab subjects us to additional risks, including the possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party, the possible cancellation, delay or modification of contracted manufacturing slots by the third party, or the termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us. In addition, in an effort to increase the availability of needed medical products, vaccinations or related therapies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, governments have required and may continue require our third-party manufacturers or our suppliers to allocate manufacturing capacity (for example pursuant to the U.S Defense Production Act) in a way that adversely affects our ability to obtain regulatory approval for and to commercialize our product candidates. During the latter half of 2020, and continuing into 2021, it has become more challenging and expensive to obtain these slots due to increased demand for production at our CMOs, many of which also manufacture vaccines and other therapeutics. Even after being reserved, the manufacturing slots for which we contract are subject to risk of displacement as mandated from Rated Orders issued under the Defense Production Act (DPA). This displacement risk has caused us to expend significant efforts to manage our supply chain. Despite those efforts, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience shortages of raw materials and critical components we necessary for our manufacturing processes. Accordingly, the inability to manage our manufacturing capacity could delay our ability to generate revenues from sales of lenzilumab.\nOur third-party manufacturers are independent entities subject to their own unique operational and financial risks that are out of our control. If we or any of these third-party manufacturers fail to perform as required, this could cause delays in our clinical trials and applications for regulatory approval. Further, we may have to pay the costs of manufacturing any batch that fails to pass quality inspection or meet regulatory approval. In addition, we, our third-party manufacturers may only be able to produce some of our products at one or a limited number of facilities and, therefore, we have limited manufacturing capacity for certain products, and we may not be able to locate additional or replacement facilities on a reasonable basis or at all. Our sales of such products could also be adversely impacted by our reliance on such limited number of facilities. To the extent these risks materialize and affect their performance obligations to us, our financial results may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the process of manufacturing biologics is extremely susceptible to product loss due to contamination, equipment failure or improper installation or operation of equipment, or vendor or operator error. Even minor deviations from normal manufacturing processes could result in reduced production yields, product defects and other supply disruptions. If microbial, viral or other contaminations are discovered in our products or in the manufacturing facilities in which our products are made, such manufacturing facilities may need to be closed for an extended period of time to investigate and remedy the contamination. Lenzilumab produced in these facilities may be quarantined or recalled and not available for clinical or commercial use. As we encounter any of these difficulties, our ability to manufacture and sell any products that may be authorized or approved for commercial use could be impaired, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe may not be able to obtain materials or supplies necessary to conduct clinical trials or, following requisite regulatory authorizations or approvals, to manufacture and sell our products, which could limit our ability to generate revenues.\nWe need access to certain supplies and products to conduct our clinical trials and, if an EUA or BLA or other approval were to be received, to manufacture and sell our products. If we are unable to purchase sufficient quantities of these materials or find suitable alternative materials in a timely manner, our development efforts for our product candidates may be delayed or our ability to manufacture our products could be limited, which could limit our ability to generate revenues.\nSuppliers of key components and materials must be named in the EUA, BLA or other marketing authorization application filed with the regulatory authority for any product candidate for which we are seeking marketing approval, and significant delays can occur if the qualification of a new supplier is required. Even after a manufacturer is qualified by the regulatory authority, the manufacturer must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to ensure full compliance with GMP. Manufacturers are subject to regular periodic inspections by regulatory authorities following initial approval. If, as a result of these inspections, a regulatory authority determines that the equipment, facilities, laboratories or processes do not comply with applicable regulations and conditions of product approval, the regulatory authority may suspend the manufacturing operations. If the manufacturing operations of any of the single suppliers for our products are suspended, we may be unable to generate sufficient quantities of commercial or clinical supplies of product to meet market demand, which could in turn decrease our revenues and harm our business. In addition, if deliveries of materials from our suppliers were interrupted for any reason, we may be unable to supply our product candidates in development for clinical trials or ship them to customers, if authorized or approved for commercial use. In addition, some of our products and the materials that we utilize in our operations are manufactured at only one facility or from a single vendor, which we may not be able to replace in a timely manner and on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Problems with any of the single suppliers we depend on, including in the event of a disaster, such as an earthquake, equipment failure or other difficulty, may negatively impact our development and commercialization efforts.\nA significant portion of the raw materials and intermediates used to manufacture our product candidates are supplied by third-party manufacturers and corporate partners outside of the United States. As a result, any political or economic factors in a specific country or region, including any changes in or interpretations of trade regulations, compliance requirements or tax legislation, that would limit or prevent third parties outside of the United States from supplying these materials could adversely affect our ability conduct our pending or contemplated clinical trials.\nIf we were to encounter any of these difficulties, our ability to conduct clinical trials on product candidates and to manufacture and sell any products that may be authorized or approved for commercial use could be impaired, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nInterim, \u201ctop-line\u201d or preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time may change as more patient data become available and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data.\nFrom time to time, we may publicly disclose preliminary or \u201ctop-line\u201d data from our clinical trials, which is based on a preliminary analysis of then-available top-line data, and the results and related findings and conclusions are subject to change following a full analysis of all data related to the particular trial. We also make assumptions, estimations, calculations and conclusions as part of our analyses of data, and we may not have received or had the opportunity to fully and carefully evaluate all data. As a result, the top-line results that we report may differ from future results of the same trials, or different conclusions or considerations may qualify such results once additional data have been received and fully evaluated. Top-line data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published. As a result, top-line data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. We may also disclose interim data from our clinical trials. Interim data from clinical trials that we may complete are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available. Adverse differences between preliminary or interim data and final data could significantly harm our business prospects. Further, disclosure of preliminary or interim data by us or by our competitors could result in volatility in the price of shares of our common stock.\nFurther, others, including regulatory agencies, may not accept or agree with our assumptions, estimates, calculations, conclusions or analyses or may interpret or weigh the importance of data differently, which could impact the value of the particular program, the approvability or commercialization of the particular product candidate or product and our business in general. In addition, the information we choose to publicly disclose regarding a particular study or clinical trial is based on what is typically extensive information, and you or others may not agree with what we determine is the material or otherwise appropriate information to include in our disclosure, and any information we determine not to disclose may ultimately be deemed significant with respect to future decisions, conclusions, views, activities or otherwise regarding a particular drug, product candidate or our business. If the top-line data that we report differ from actual results, or if others, including regulatory authorities, disagree with the conclusions reached, our ability to obtain approval for and commercialize in our current or any our future product candidate, our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition may be harmed.\nOur inability to accurately predict demand for lenzilumab makes it difficult for us to accurately forecast any sales and may cause our forecasts to fluctuate and could adversely affect our stock price.\nWe may be unable to accurately predict demand for lenzilumab, or other approved or unapproved products for COVID-19, as demand depends on a number of factors, including rollout and effectiveness of approved vaccines, competing drug products and other treatments that may be developed for COVID-19 and other illnesses and conditions and federal and state social measures design to slow the spread of COVID-19. If lenzilumab is commercialized, we may be unsuccessful in estimating user demand and may not be effective in matching inventory levels and locations to actual end user demand, in particular if the COVID-19 outbreak is effectively contained or the risk of coronavirus infection is significantly diminished. In addition, adverse changes in economic conditions, increased competition, including through approved vaccines or other therapeutic, or other factors may cause hospitals or other users or distributors of lenzilumab to reduce inventories of our products, which would reduce their orders for lenzilumab, even if end user demand has not changed. As a result, even if lenzilumab receives an EUA or BLA approval for use in COVID-19 patients, our revenues may be difficult to predict and vulnerable to extreme fluctuations.\nThere can be no assurance that lenzilumab, even if approved, would ever become profitable, due to government interest and public perception regarding a vaccine and treatments for COVID-19 related complications.\nAs a result of the emergency situations in many countries, there is a heightened risk that a COVID-19 therapy or other treatments for COVID-19 pneumonia and symptoms may be subject to adverse governmental actions in certain countries, including intellectual property expropriation, compulsory licenses, strict price controls or other actions. Additionally, we may need to, or we may be required by governmental or non-governmental authorities to, set aside specific quantities of doses of lenzilumab for designated purposes or geographic areas. We may face challenges related to the allocation of supply of lenzilumab, particularly with respect to geographic distribution. Thus, even if lenzilumab is approved, such governmental actions may limit our ability to recoup our current and future expenses incurred to develop and commercialize lenzilumab.\nFurthermore, public sentiment regarding commercialization of a COVID-19 therapy or other treatment may limit or negate our ability to generate revenues from sales of lenzilumab. Given that COVID-19 has been designated as a pandemic and represents an urgent public health crisis, we are likely to face significant public attention and scrutiny over any future business models and pricing decisions with respect to lenzilumab. If we are unable to successfully manage these risks, we could face significant reputational harm, which could negatively affect the price of our common stock.\nThe regulatory pathway for lenzilumab is highly dynamic and continues to evolve and may result in unexpected or unforeseen challenges.\nTo date, lenzilumab has moved rapidly through the regulatory review process of FDA. The speed at which all parties are acting to create and test many therapeutics and vaccines for COVID-19 is unusual and evolving or changing plans or priorities within FDA and foreign regulatory authorities, including changes based on new knowledge of COVID-19 and how the disease affects the human body, may significantly affect the regulatory timeline for lenzilumab. Results from clinical testing may raise new questions and require us to redesign proposed clinical trials, including revising proposed endpoints or adding new clinical trial sites or cohorts of subjects.\nFor example, FDA on June 30, 2020 adopted guidance outlining the FDA\u2019s current recommendations regarding the data needed to facilitate clinical development and licensure of vaccines to prevent COVID-19. Although we intend to design any future clinical trials for lenzilumab in accordance with FDA and other applicable regulatory guidance, we cannot be certain that, as the regulatory pathway continues to evolve, we will be able to complete a clinical trial in accordance with FDA\u2019s guidance and regulations then in effect. A failure to complete a clinical trial in accordance with guidance and regulations then in effect could impair our ability to obtain approval for lenzilumab, which may adversely affect our operating results, reputation and ability to raise capital and enter into or maintain collaborations to advance lenzilumab.\nAdditionally, FDA has the authority to grant an EUA to allow unapproved medical products to be used in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. If we are granted an EUA for lenzilumab, we would be able to commercialize lenzilumab prior to FDA approval. However, FDA may revoke an EUA where it is determined that the underlying health emergency no longer exists or warrants such authorization, and we cannot predict how long, if ever, an EUA would remain in place. Such revocation could adversely impact our business in a variety of ways, including if lenzilumab is not yet approved by FDA and if we and our manufacturing partners have invested in the supply chain to provide lenzilumab under an EUA.\nEven if Emergency Use Authorization or regulatory approval is received for lenzilumab, the later discovery of previously unknown problems associated with the use of lenzilumab may result in restrictions, including withdrawal of the product from the market, and lead to significant liabilities and reputational damage.\nBecause the path to marketing approval of any vaccine for COVID-19, or drug used to treat COVID-19 pneumonia or other symptoms is unclear, lenzilumab may be widely used and in circulation in the United States or another country prior to our receipt of marketing approval. Unexpected safety issues, including any that we have not yet observed in our Phase 3 clinical trial for lenzilumab, could lead to significant reputational damage to us and our platforms going forward and other issues, including delays in our other programs, the need for re-design of our clinical trial and the need for significant additional financial resources.\nWe also may be restricted or prohibited from marketing or manufacturing lenzilumab, even after obtaining product approval, if previously unknown problems with lenzilumab or its manufacture are subsequently discovered. We cannot provide assurance that newly discovered or developed safety issues will not arise following regulatory approval. With the use of any drug product or treatment by a wide patient population, serious adverse events may occur from time to time that did not arise in the clinical trials of the product or that initially appeared to be unrelated to the vaccine itself and only with the collection of subsequent information were found to be causally related to the product. Any such safety issues could cause us to suspend or cease marketing of our approved products, possibly subject us to substantial liabilities, and adversely affect our ability to generate revenue and our financial condition.\nWe currently have no internal sales and marketing capabilities and will rely on partners such as Eversana and other third parties to market and sell lenzilumab if we attain an EUA or other regulatory approval for its commercialization, and any product candidates we may successfully develop. We or they may not be able to effectively market and sell any such product candidates.\nWhile we have entered into several agreements with commercial partners who will provide sales and marketing support as well as logistic and distribution services, we currently do not have the internal sales and marketing infrastructure in place that would be necessary to sell and market products. We have engaged Eversana to serve as our end-to-end commercial partner in marketing and selling lenzilumab, if approved, and have entered into other arrangements with distribution partners as described under \u201cItem 1. Business-Sales and Marketing.\u201d There can be no assurance that our partners will be effective in marketing and selling lenzilumab.\nIf we or Eversana fail to hire, train, retain and manage qualified sales personnel, market our product successfully or on a cost-effective basis or otherwise terminate our agreement, our ability to generate revenue will be limited and we will need to identify and retain an alternative third-party, or develop our own sales and marketing capability. The establishment of a sales and marketing operation can be expensive and time consuming and could delay any product candidate launch.\nWe may experience significant volatility in the market price of our common stock following announcements and releases regarding our ongoing development of lenzilumab as a potential COVID-19 therapy.\nBiopharmaceutical companies that are developing potential therapeutics and vaccines to combat COVID-19, including our company, have experienced significant volatility in the price of their securities upon publication of preclinical and clinical data as well as news about their development programs. Since our initial announcement of our plans to develop lenzilumab as a therapy for COVID-19 patients, our common stock has experienced wide variations in daily trading volume and price movements. We expect that over the coming months we may make public several additional data and clinical updates with respect to lenzilumab and our commercialization efforts for lenzilumab. We cannot predict public reaction or the impact on the market price of our common stock once further announcements regarding lenzilumab or developments from our on-going clinical trial are announced. Given the attention being paid to the COVID-19 pandemic and the public scrutiny of COVID-19 development announcements and data releases to date, we expect that any public announcements we make in the coming months regarding the ongoing development and commercialization of lenzilumab will attract significant attention and scrutiny and that, as a result, the price of our common stock may be particularly volatile during this time.\nOther Risks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe have a history of operating losses, we expect to continue to incur losses, and we may never become profitable.\nWe have incurred net losses in nearly every year since our inception. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 we incurred a net loss of $89.5 million, and we have an accumulated deficit of $374.4 million as of December 31, 2020. Since inception, we have recognized a nominal amount of revenue from payments for funded research and development and for license or collaboration fees, $0.3 million of which was recognized in 2020. We expect to make substantial expenditures and incur additional operating losses in the future to further develop and commercialize our product candidates. Our accumulated deficit is expected to increase significantly as we continue our development and clinical trial efforts. Our ability to achieve and sustain profitability depends on obtaining regulatory approvals for and successfully commercializing our product candidates, either alone or with third parties. We do not currently have the required approvals to market any of our product candidates and we may never receive them. We may not be profitable even if we or any future development partners succeed in commercializing any of our product candidates. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing and commercializing our product candidates, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when we will become profitable, if at all.\nOur ability to execute on all of the initiatives in our development pipeline is substantially dependent on third parties to plan and conduct the referenced studies and clinical trials.\nOur success depends on our ability to negotiate agreements with third parties with resources to plan and conduct the initiatives, studies and clinical trials we are pursuing. If we are not able to reach agreements with current or future partners for it, we will not be able to execute on each of these particular initiatives, studies and trials. Our inability to identify and complete negotiations with any such third party therefore could have a material and adverse impact on our ability to pursue our business plan in respect of the applicable element of our pipeline, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe will need to obtain additional financing to fund our operations and, if we are unable to obtain such financing, we may be unable to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe believe that the Company\u2019s cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our planned operations and capital expenditure requirements for at least 12 months. This evaluation is based on relevant conditions and events that are currently known or reasonably knowable. As a result, we could deplete our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect, and a delay in obtaining or failure to obtain an EUA could further constrain our cash resources. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and our operating projections, including our projected net revenue following the potential receipt of an EUA for lenzilumab in COVID-19 patients, may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us.\nWe expect we will need to obtain additional financing to fund our future operations, including for the development, manufacturing, distribution and commercialization of lenzilumab for patients with COVID-19 and other indications including CRS and GvHD and our other product candidates. We may need to obtain additional financing to conduct additional trials for the approval of our product candidates if requested by regulatory authorities in the US and other countries, and to complete the development of any additional product candidates we own or might acquire. Moreover, our fixed expenses such as salaries, committed payments to our contract manufacturers, and other contractual commitments, are substantial and are expected to increase in the future. Our need to raise funds will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to establish additional relationships for the manufacture of lenzilumab and our ability to commence commercialization and begin generating revenues from product sales if lenzilumab were to be issued an EUA and eventually approved under a BLA.\nUntil we can generate a sufficient amount of revenue, we may finance future cash needs through public or private equity offerings, license agreements, grant financing and support from governmental agencies, convertible debt, other debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and marketing, supply, distribution or licensing arrangements. Additional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay or reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs, our commercialization efforts or our manufacturing commitments and capacity. We may seek to access the public or private capital markets whenever conditions are favorable, even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time. In addition, if we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, supply, distribution, or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.\nOur business depends on the success of our current product candidates. We cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize, any of our product candidates.\nWe have a limited pipeline of product candidates and we do not plan to conduct active research at this time for discovery of new molecules or antibodies. We depend on the successful continued development and regulatory approval of our current product candidates for our future business success. Since the fall of 2017, our primary focus has been the development of lenzilumab. We are also working to create next-generation gene-edited CAR-T therapies using GM-CSF gene knockout technologies, as well as working to develop ifabotuzumab and related products. We will need to successfully enroll and complete clinical trials of lenzilumab and ifabotuzumab, and potentially obtain regulatory approval to market these products. The future clinical, regulatory and commercial success of our product candidates is subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u00b7 we may not be able to enroll adequate numbers of eligible patients in the clinical trials we propose to conduct, whether alone or through collaborations, including the collaboration with Kite and the IMPACT partnership;\n\u00b7 we may not have sufficient financial and other resources to fund our clinical trials or collaborations;\n\u00b7 we may not be able to provide acceptable evidence of safety and efficacy for our product candidates;\n\u00b7 the results of our clinical trials or collaborations may not meet the level of statistical or clinical significance, or product safety, required to move to the next stage of development or, ultimately, obtain marketing approval from the FDA;\n\u00b7 we may not be able to obtain, maintain and enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights; and\n\u00b7 we may not be able to obtain and maintain commercial manufacturing arrangements with third-party manufacturers or establish commercial-scale manufacturing capabilities.\nFurthermore, even if we do receive regulatory approval to market any of our product candidates, any such approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which we may market the product. If any of our product candidates are unsuccessful, that could have a substantial negative impact on our business.\nAccordingly, we cannot assure you that our product candidates will be successfully developed or commercialized. If we or any future development partners are unable to develop, or obtain regulatory approval for or, if approved, successfully commercialize, one or more of our product candidates, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to continue our business.\nOur product candidates are at an early stage of development and may not be successfully developed or commercialized.\nOur product candidates are in the early stages of development and will require substantial clinical development, testing, and regulatory approval prior to commercialization. Of the large number of drugs in development, only a small percentage successfully completes the FDA regulatory approval process and are commercialized. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that our product candidates will be successfully developed or commercialized. If we or any future development partners are unable to develop, or obtain regulatory approval for or, if approved, successfully commercialize, one or more of our product candidates, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to continue our business.\nThe adoption of CAR-T therapies as the potential standard of care for treatment of certain cancers is uncertain, and dependent on the efforts of a limited number of market entrants, and if not adopted as anticipated, the market for lenzilumab or next-generation gene-edited CAR-T therapies may be limited or not develop.\nWe are seeking to advance the development of lenzilumab to address, among other things, the serious and potentially fatal side effects associated with CAR-T therapies and to improve the efficacy of these treatments. We are also working to create next-generation gene-edited CAR-T therapies using GM-CSF gene knockout technologies. Although two CAR-T therapies have been approved by FDA to date, the use of engineered T cells as a potential cancer treatment is a recent development and may not be broadly accepted by physicians, patients, hospitals, cancer treatment centers, payers and others in the medical community. The degree of market acceptance of any approved product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7 the efficacy and safety as demonstrated in clinical trials;\n\u00b7 the clinical indications for which the product candidate is approved;\n\u00b7 acceptance by physicians, major operators of hospitals and clinics, and patients of the product candidate as a safe and effective treatment;\n\u00b7 the potential and perceived advantages of product candidates over alternative treatments;\n\u00b7 the safety of product candidates seen in a broader patient group, including its use outside the approved indications;\n\u00b7 competitive approaches to tackle similar issues;\n\u00b7 the cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments;\n\u00b7 the availability of adequate reimbursement and pricing by payers;\n\u00b7 relative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u00b7 the prevalence and severity of adverse events;\n\u00b7 the effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts; and\n\u00b7 the ability to manage any unfavorable publicity relating to the product candidate.\nIf the medical and payer community is not sufficiently persuaded of the safety, efficacy and cost-effectiveness of CAR-T therapy and the potential advantages of using lenzilumab compared to existing and future therapeutics, and there is not significant market acceptance of CAR-T therapy as the standard of care for treatment of certain cancers, the market for lenzilumab or next-generation gene-edited CAR-T therapies may be limited or not develop, and our stock price could be adversely affected.\nCAR-T therapies currently in early development purport to incorporate technology that may minimize or eliminate the adverse side-effects that we believe have impaired the uptake of the approved CAR-T therapies. If these developing therapies are proven equally efficacious in their proposed indications and approved for use by FDA and other regulatory agencies, the market growth for the currently approved CAR-T therapies may be limited, impairing demand for lenzilumab.\nIn recent months, several biotechnology companies describing business plans focusing on development of CAR-T therapies have completed or announced they are pursuing initial public offerings, or \u201cIPOs\u201d. Several of these companies have described their belief that their therapies will not result in the same level of CRS or NT as has been experienced in use of previously FDA-approved CAR-T therapies. While these products are in early-stage development, the data is limited and these products have not yet been approved for use by FDA, if any such product were also proven equally efficacious and subsequently approved, the market for lenzilumab may not develop or grow as anticipated. Recently the FDA approved Breyanzi), a new CAR-T cell therapy for adults with relapsed or refractory Large B-cell Lymphoma. Grade \u22653 cytokine release syndrome and Grade \u22653 neurologic toxicities following Breyanzi treatment occurred in 4% and 12% of patients, respectively. If new CAR-T therapies with lower occurrences of CRS and NT are approved, the market for lenzilumab in conjunction with CAR-T therapy may be diminished. Any such failure of a market for lenzilumab to develop could adversely affect our stock price.\nOur business could target benefits from various regulatory incentives, such as Emergency Use Authorization, orphan drug exclusivity, breakthrough therapy designation, fast track designation, and priority review, but we may not ultimately qualify for or benefit from these arrangements.\nWe may seek various regulatory incentives, such as Emergency Use Authorization, orphan drug exclusivity, breakthrough therapy designation, fast track designation, accelerated approval, priority review and Priority Review Vouchers (\u201cPRVs\u201d), where available, that provide for certain periods of exclusivity, expedited review and/or other benefits, and we may also seek similar designations elsewhere in the world. Often, regulatory agencies have broad discretion in determining whether or not products qualify for such regulatory incentives and benefits. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to receive orphan drug status from FDA or equivalent regulatory designations elsewhere. We also cannot guarantee that we will obtain breakthrough therapy or fast track designation, which may provide certain potential benefits such as more frequent meetings with FDA to discuss the development plan, intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program, and potential eligibility for rolling review or priority review. Legislative developments in the U.S., including recent proposed legislation that would restrict eligibility for PRVs, may affect our ability to qualify for these programs in the future.\nEven if we are successful in obtaining beneficial regulatory designations by FDA or other regulatory agency for our product candidates, such designations may not lead to faster development or regulatory review or approval, and it does not increase the likelihood that our product candidates will receive marketing approval. We may not be able to obtain or maintain such designations for our product candidates, and our competitors may obtain these designations for their product candidates, which could impact our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates or compete with such competitors, which would adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThere is a limited amount of information about us upon which investors can evaluate our product candidates and business prospects, including because we have a limited operating history developing product candidates, have not yet successfully commercialized any products, have changed our strategy and have a small management team.\nOur primary focus is developing our proprietary monoclonal antibody portfolio, which comprises lenzilumab, ifabotuzumab and HGEN005. We are also currently developing our GM-CSF knockout gene-editing CAR-T platform to create next-generation CAR-T therapies that preserve the benefits of CAR-T therapy while altogether avoiding its serious and potentially life-threatening side-effects. Our limited operating history developing clinical-stage product candidates may make it more difficult for us to succeed or for investors to be able to evaluate our business and prospects. In addition, as an early-stage clinical development company, we have limited experience in development activities, including conducting clinical trials, or seeking and obtaining regulatory approvals, even though our executives have had relevant experience at other companies. We currently have ten full-time employees and therefore are heavily dependent on external consultants and expert vendors for scientific, clinical manufacturing and regulatory expertise. We have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully overcome many of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in the biopharmaceutical area. To execute our business plan we will need to successfully:\n\u00b7 execute our product candidate development activities, including successfully completing our clinical trial programs, including our collaborations with Kite and the IMPACT partnership;\n\u00b7 obtain required regulatory approvals or authoriztions for the development and commercialization of our product candidates;\n\u00b7 manage our costs and expenses related to clinical trials, regulatory approvals, manufacturing and commercialization;\n\u00b7 secure substantial additional funding;\n\u00b7 develop and maintain successful strategic relationships;\n\u00b7 build and maintain a strong intellectual property portfolio;\n\u00b7 build and maintain appropriate clinical, sales, manufacturing, distribution, and marketing capabilities on our own or through third parties; and\n\u00b7 gain market acceptance and favorable reimbursement status for our product candidates.\nIf we are unsuccessful in accomplishing these objectives, we may not be able to develop product candidates, raise capital, expand our business, or continue our operations.\nOur collaboration with Kite is critically important to our business. If we are unable to maintain this collaboration, or if this collaboration is not successful, our business could be adversely affected.\nIn May 2019, we entered into the Kite Agreement to conduct a multi-center Phase 1b/2 study of lenzilumab with Kite\u2019s Yescarta in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphoma. See \"Business - Kite Collaboration.\"\nPursuant to the terms of the Kite Agreement, Kite may elect to terminate or suspend the Study at any time. Because we currently rely on Kite for a substantial portion of our discovery capabilities, if Kite delays or fails to perform its obligations under the Kite Agreement, disagrees with our interpretation of the terms of the collaboration or our discovery plan or terminates the Kite Agreement, our pipeline of product candidates would be adversely affected. Kite may also fail to properly maintain or defend the intellectual property we have licensed from them, or even infringe upon, our intellectual property rights, leading to the potential invalidation of our intellectual property or subjecting us to litigation or arbitration, any of which would be time-consuming and expensive. Additionally, either party has the right to terminate the Kite Agreement under certain circumstances. If our collaboration with Kite is terminated, the development of lenzilumab would be materially delayed or harmed.\nIn addition to our collaboration with Kite and the IMPACT partnership, we may, in the future, seek to enter into collaborations with other third parties for the discovery, development and commercialization of our product candidates. If our collaborators cease development efforts under our collaboration agreements, or if any of those agreements are terminated, these collaborations may fail to lead to commercial products and we may never receive milestone payments or future royalties under these agreements.\nWe may in the future seek to enter into agreements with other third-party collaborators for research, development and commercialization of other therapeutic technologies or product candidates. Biopharmaceutical companies are our likely future collaborators for any marketing, distribution, development, licensing, or broader collaboration arrangements. If we fail to enter into future collaborations on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or such collaborations are not successful, we may not be able to execute our strategy to develop our product candidates or therapies that we believe could benefit from the resources of either larger biopharmaceutical companies or those specialized in a particular area of relevance.\nWith respect to our existing Kite Agreement and with any future collaboration agreements, we have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators dedicate to the development or commercialization of our product candidates. Moreover, our ability to generate revenues from these arrangements will depend on our collaborators' abilities to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements.\nCollaborations involving our product candidates pose the following risks to us:\n\u00b7 collaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations;\n\u00b7 collaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of our product candidates or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on preclinical studies or clinical trial results, changes in the collaborators' strategic focus or available funding, or external factors such as an acquisition that diverts resources or creates competing priorities;\n\u00b7 collaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\u00b7 collaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our product candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours;\n\u00b7 collaborators with marketing and distribution rights to one or more products may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of such product or products;\n\u00b7 collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to litigation or potential liability;\n\u00b7 collaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability;\n\u00b7 disputes may arise between the collaborators and us that result in the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our product candidates or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources; and\n\u00b7 collaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates.\nAs a result of the foregoing, our current and any future collaboration agreements may not lead to development or commercialization of our product candidates in the most efficient manner or at all. If a collaborator of ours were to be involved in a business combination, the continued pursuit and emphasis on our product development or commercialization program could be delayed, diminished or terminated. Any failure to successfully develop or commercialize our product candidates pursuant to our current or any future collaboration agreements could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nMoreover, to the extent that any of our existing or future collaborators were to terminate a collaboration agreement, we may be forced to independently develop these product candidates, including funding preclinical studies or clinical trials, assuming marketing and distribution costs and defending intellectual property rights, or, in certain instances, abandon product candidates altogether, any of which could result in a change to our business plan and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe have relied and may in the future rely on third parties to conduct investigator-sponsored trials (\u201cISTs\u201d) of our products, which is cost-effective for us but affords the investigators the ability to retain significant control over the design and conduct of the trials, as well as the use of the data generated from their efforts.\nWe have relied and may in the future rely on third parties to conduct and sponsor clinical trials relating to lenzilumab, our GM-CSF gene knockout platform and our other immunotherapies, ifabotuzumab and HGEN005. Such ISTs may provide us with valuable clinical data that can inform our future development strategy in a cost-efficient manner, but we do not control the design or conduct of the ISTs, and it is possible that the FDA or non-U.S. regulatory authorities will not view these ISTs as providing adequate support for future clinical trials, whether controlled by us or third parties, for any one or more reasons, including elements of the design or execution of the trials or safety concerns or other trial results.\nThese arrangements provide us limited information rights with respect to the ISTs, including access to and the ability to use and reference the data, including for our own regulatory filings, resulting from the ISTs. However, we would not have control over the timing and reporting of the data from ISTs, nor would we own the data from the ISTs. If we are unable to confirm or replicate the results from the ISTs or if negative results are obtained, we would likely be further delayed or prevented from advancing further clinical development. Further, if investigators or institutions breach their obligations with respect to the clinical development of our product candidates, or if the data proves to be inadequate compared to the first-hand knowledge, we might have gained had the ISTs been sponsored and conducted by us, then our ability to design and conduct any future clinical trials ourselves may be adversely affected.\nIf the third parties conducting our clinical trials do not conduct the trials in accordance with our agreements with them, our ability to pursue our clinical development programs could be delayed or unsuccessful and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates when expected or at all.\nWe do not have the ability to conduct all aspects of our preclinical testing or clinical trials ourselves. Therefore, the timing of the initiation and completion of these trials is uncertain and may occur on substantially different timing from our estimates. We also use CROs to conduct our clinical trials and rely on medical institutions, clinical investigators, CROs, and consultants to conduct our trials in accordance with our clinical protocols and regulatory requirements. Our CROs, investigators, and other third parties play a significant role in the conduct of these trials and subsequent collection and analysis of data.\nThere is no guarantee that any CROs, investigators, or other third parties on which we rely for administration and conduct of our clinical trials will devote adequate time and resources to such trials or perform as contractually required. If any of these third parties fails to meet expected deadlines, fails to adhere to our clinical protocols, or otherwise performs in a substandard manner, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed, or terminated. If any of our clinical trial sites terminates for any reason, we may experience the loss of follow-up information on subjects enrolled in our ongoing clinical trials unless we are able to transfer those subjects to another qualified clinical trial site. In addition, principal investigators for our clinical trials may serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us from time to time and may receive cash or equity compensation in connection with such services. If these relationships and any related compensation result in perceived or actual conflicts of interest, the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site may be jeopardized.\nWe may experience delays in commencing or conducting our clinical trials, in receiving data from third parties or in the continuation or completion of clinical testing, which could result in increased costs to us, delay our ability to generate product candidate revenue or, ultimately, render us unable to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe have product candidates in clinical development and preclinical development. The risk of failure for each of our product candidates is high. It is impossible to predict when or if any of our product candidates will prove effective or safe in humans or will receive regulatory approval. Before obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of any product candidate, we must complete preclinical development and then conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans.\nBefore we can initiate clinical trials in the United States for any new product candidates, we are required to submit the results of preclinical testing to FDA as part of an IND application, along with other information including information about product candidate chemistry, manufacturing, and controls and our proposed clinical trial protocol. For our programs already underway, we are required to report or provide information to appropriate regulatory authorities in order to continue with our testing programs. If we are unable to make timely regulatory submissions for any of our programs, it will delay our plans for our clinical trials. If those third parties do not make the required data available to us, we will likely have to identify and contract with another third party, and/or develop all necessary preclinical and clinical data on our own, which will lead to significant delays and increase development costs of the product candidate. In addition, FDA may require us to conduct additional preclinical testing for any product candidate before it allows us to initiate clinical testing under any IND application, which may lead to additional delays and increase the costs of our preclinical development. Moreover, despite the presence of an active IND application for a product candidate, clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including delays in:\n\u00b7 identifying, recruiting, and enrolling qualified subjects to participate in a clinical trial;\n\u00b7 identifying, recruiting, and training suitable clinical investigators;\n\u00b7 reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation, may be subject to modification from time to time, and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u00b7 obtaining and maintaining sufficient quantities of a product candidate for use in clinical trials, either as a result of transferring the manufacturing of a product candidate to another site or manufacturer, deferring ordering or production of product in order to conserve resources or mitigate risk, having product in inventory become no longer suitable for use in humans, or other reasons that reduce or delay availability of drug supply;\n\u00b7 obtaining and maintaining Institutional Review Board (\u201cIRB\u201d) or ethics committee approval to conduct a clinical trial at an existing or prospective site;\n\u00b7 retaining or replacing participants who have initiated a clinical trial but may withdraw due to adverse events from the therapy, insufficient efficacy, fatigue with the clinical trial process, or personal issues;\n\u00b7 developing any companion diagnostic necessary to ensure the study enrolls the target population;\n\u00b7 being required by the FDA to add more patients or sites or to conduct additional trials; or\n\u00b7 the FDA placing a clinical trial on hold.\nOnce a clinical trial has begun, recruitment and enrollment of subjects may be slower than we anticipate. Numerous companies and institutions are conducting clinical studies in similar patient populations which can result in competition for qualified patients. In addition, clinical trials will take longer than we anticipate if we are required, or believe it is necessary, to enroll additional subjects than originally planned. Clinical trials may also be delayed as a result of ambiguous or negative interim results. Further, a clinical trial may be suspended or terminated by us, an IRB, an ethics committee, or a data safety monitoring committee overseeing the clinical trial, any of our clinical trial sites with respect to that site, or FDA or other regulatory authorities, due to several factors, including:\n\u00b7 failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols;\n\u00b7 inspection of the clinical trial operations or clinical trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities;\n\u00b7 inability to provide timely supply of drug product due to shortages or other issues with the drug product;\n\u00b7 unforeseen safety issues, known safety issues that occur at a greater frequency or severity than we anticipate, or any determination that the clinical trial presents unacceptable health risks; or\n\u00b7 lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial or unforeseen significant incremental costs related to the trial.\nAdditionally, if any future development partners do not develop the licensed product candidates in the time and manner that we expect, or at all, the clinical development efforts related to these licensed product candidates could be delayed or terminated. In addition, our ability to enforce our partners\u2019 obligations under any future collaboration efforts may be limited due to time and resource constraints, competing corporate priorities of our future partners, and other factors.\nAny delays in the commencement of our clinical trials may delay or preclude our ability to further develop or pursue regulatory approval for our product candidates. Changes in U.S. and foreign regulatory requirements and guidance also may occur, and we may need to amend clinical trial protocols to reflect these changes. Amendments may require us to resubmit our clinical trial protocols to IRBs for re-examination, which may affect the costs, timing, and likelihood of a successful completion of a clinical trial.\nIf we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our product candidates beyond those that we currently contemplate, if we are unable to successfully complete clinical trials of our product candidates or other testing, if the results of these trials or tests are not positive or are only modestly positive or if there are safety concerns, we may:\n\u00b7 be delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates;\n\u00b7 not obtain marketing approval or EUA at all;\n\u00b7 obtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired;\n\u00b7 obtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings;\n\u00b7 be subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements; or\n\u00b7 have the product removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval.\nOur product development costs will also increase if we experience delays in testing or in obtaining marketing approvals. We do not know whether any of our preclinical studies or clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, or at all. We may also determine to change the design or protocol of one or more of our clinical trials, including to add additional arms or patient populations, which could result in increased costs and expenses and/or delays. If we or any future development partners experience delays in the completion of, or if we or any future development partners must terminate, any clinical trial of any product candidate our ability to obtain regulatory approval for that product candidate will be delayed and the commercial prospects, if any, for the product candidate may suffer as a result. Significant preclinical study or clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and may harm our business and results of operations. In addition, many of these factors may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate.\nOur product candidates are subject to extensive regulation, compliance with which is costly and time consuming, may cause unanticipated delays, or may prevent the receipt of the required approvals to commercialize our product candidates.\nThe clinical development, approval, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export, marketing, and distribution of our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by FDA in the United States and by comparable authorities in foreign markets. In the United States, we are not permitted to market our product candidates until we receive regulatory approval from FDA. The process of obtaining regulatory approval is expensive, often takes many years, and can vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the products involved, as well as the target indications. Approval policies or regulations may change, and FDA has substantial discretion in the drug approval process, including the ability to delay, limit, or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons. Despite the time and expense invested in clinical development of product candidates, regulatory approval is never guaranteed. FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities can delay, limit, or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons, including:\n\u00b7 such authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our or any future development partners\u2019 clinical trials;\n\u00b7 such authorities may not accept clinical data from trials that are conducted at clinical facilities or in countries where the standard of care is potentially different from the United States;\n\u00b7 the results of clinical trials may not demonstrate the safety or efficacy required by such authorities for approval;\n\u00b7 we or any future development partners may be unable to demonstrate that a product candidate\u2019s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;\n\u00b7 such authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical;\n\u00b7 such authorities may find deficiencies in the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we or any future development partners contract for clinical and commercial supplies; or\n\u00b7 the approval policies or regulations of such authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our or any future development partners\u2019 clinical data insufficient for approval.\nWith respect to foreign markets, approval procedures vary widely among countries and, in addition to the aforementioned risks, can involve additional product testing, administrative review periods, and agreements with pricing authorities. In addition, events raising questions about the safety of certain marketed pharmaceuticals may result in increased caution by FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities in reviewing new drugs based on safety, efficacy or other regulatory considerations and may result in significant delays in obtaining regulatory approvals. Any delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, applicable regulatory approvals may delay or prevent us or any future development partners from commercializing our product candidates.\nThe results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials are not always predictive of future results. Any product candidate we or any future development partners advance into clinical trials may not have favorable results in later clinical trials, if any, or receive regulatory approval.\nDrug development has substantial inherent risk. We or any future development partners will be required to demonstrate through adequate and well-controlled clinical trials that our product candidates are effective, with a favorable benefit-risk profile, for use in their target populations for their intended indications before we can seek regulatory approvals for their commercial sale. Drug development is a long, expensive and uncertain process, and delay or failure can occur at any stage of development, including after commencement of any of our clinical trials. Success in early clinical trials does not mean that later clinical trials will be successful because product candidates in later-stage clinical trials may fail to demonstrate sufficient safety or efficacy despite having progressed through initial clinical testing. Furthermore, our future trials will need to demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy for approval by regulatory authorities in larger patient populations. Companies frequently suffer significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after earlier clinical trials have shown promising results. In addition, only a small percentage of drugs under development result in the submission of an NDA or BLA to FDA and even fewer are approved for commercialization.\nIn addition, serious adverse or undesirable side effects may emerge or be identified during later stages of development that were not observed in earlier stages. If our product candidates, either alone or in combination with other therapeutics, are associated with serious adverse events or undesirable side effects or unacceptable drug-drug interactions in clinical trials or have characteristics that are unexpected in clinical trials or preclinical testing, we may need to abandon their development or limit development to more narrow uses or subpopulations in which the serious adverse events, undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. In pharmaceutical development, many compounds that initially show promise in early-stage or clinical testing are later found to cause side effects that prevent further development of the compound. In addition, if third parties manufacture or use our product candidates without our permission, and generate adverse events or unacceptable side effects, this could also have an adverse impact on our development efforts.\nUnacceptable adverse events caused by any of our product candidates that we advance into clinical trials could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay, or halt clinical trials and could result in the denial of regulatory approval by FDA or other regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications and markets. This in turn could prevent us from completing development or commercializing the affected product candidate and generating revenue from its sale. We have not yet successfully completed testing of any of our product candidates for the treatment of the indications for which we intend to seek approval in humans, and we currently do not know the extent of adverse events, if any, that will be observed in individuals who receive any of our product candidates. If any of our product candidates cause unacceptable adverse events in clinical trials, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval or commercialize such product candidates.\nWe face risks associated with clinical operations abroad, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency, Anvisa, has granted us permission to expand our Phase 3 study of lenzilumab in patients with COVID-19 in Brazil and we enrolled patients in that country. In addition, the Mexican regulatory agency, COFEPRIS, has granted us permission to expand the Phase 3 study of lenzilumab in patients with COVID-19 in Mexico. We did not open any sites in Mexico or enroll any patients in that country; however, we may do so in the future for a different study. Partners also are conducting or planning to conduct clinical trials involving lenzilumab in Australia, Korea and the United Kingdom and potentially other countries in patients with COVID-19 and other indications. We have not received any authorization or approval to sell lenzilumab in any country but would expect to commence commercial operations, through a partner or on our own, once any such authorization or approval were received. Operations abroad are accompanied by certain financial, political, economic and other risks, including those listed below:\n\u00b7 Foreign Currency Exchange: Operations internationally may subject us to risks related to foreign currency exchange risks as we make payments, or incur obligations, denominated in foreign currencies. We cannot predict future fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates of the U.S. dollar. If the U.S. dollar appreciates significantly against certain currencies and our practices do not sufficiently offset the effects of such appreciation, our results of operations would be adversely affected, and our stock price may decline.\n\u00b7 Anti-Bribery: We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws that will govern our international operations with respect to payments to government officials. Our international operations would be heavily regulated and require significant interaction with foreign officials. In certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices or may require us to interact with doctors and hospitals, some of which may be state controlled, in a manner that is different than local custom. In addition, despite our efforts, our policies and procedures may not protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by persons who act on our behalf. Enforcement activities under anti-bribery laws could subject us to administrative and legal proceedings and actions, which could result in civil and criminal sanctions, including monetary penalties and exclusion from health care programs.\n\u00b7 Other risks inherent in conducting foreign operations include:\no International operations, including any use of third-party manufacturers, distributors, CROs and collaboration arrangements outside the United States, expose us to increased risk of theft of our intellectual property and other proprietary technology, particularly in jurisdictions with less robust intellectual property protections than the United States, as well as restrictive government actions against our intellectual property and other foreign assets such as nationalization, expropriation or the imposition of compulsory licenses.\no We may be subject to protective economic policies taken by foreign governments, such as trade protection measures and import and export licensing requirements, which may result in the imposition of trade sanctions or similar restrictions by the United States or other governments.\no Our foreign operations, third-party manufacturers, CROs or strategic partners could be subject to business interruptions for which we or they may be uninsured or inadequately insured.\no Our operations may also be adversely affected if there is political instability or disruption in any other geographic region where we may have operations, which could impact our ability to do business in those areas.\nIf we were to encounter any of these risks, our foreign operations may be adversely affected, which could have an adverse effect on our overall business and results of operations.\nIf we fail to attract and retain key management and clinical development personnel, or if the attention of such personnel is diverted, we may be unable to successfully manage our business and develop or commercialize our product candidates.\nWe will need to effectively manage our managerial, operational, financial, and other resources in order to successfully pursue our clinical development and commercialization efforts. As a company with a limited number of personnel, we are heavily affected by turnover and highly dependent on the expertise of the members of our senior management, in particular our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Cameron Durrant, and Dr. Dale Chappell, the controlling owner of the Black Horse Entities (as defined below), our current Chief Scientific Officer and a director. Furthermore, we rely on third party consultants for a variety of services. We cannot predict the impact of the loss of such individuals or the loss of services of any of our other senior management, should they occur, or the difficulty in replacing such individuals. Such losses could delay or prevent the further development and potential commercialization of our product candidates and, if we are not successful in finding suitable replacements, could harm our business.\nIf our competitors develop treatments for the target indications of our product candidates that are approved more quickly, marketed more successfully or are demonstrated to be safer or more effective than our product candidates, or if FDA approves generic or biosimilar competitors to our products post-approval, our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated.\nWe compete in an industry characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition, a changing regulatory and legislative landscape and a strong emphasis on the benefits of intellectual property protection and regulatory exclusivities. Our competitors include pharmaceutical companies, other biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other private and public research organizations. We compete with these parties in immunotherapy and oncology treatments and in recruiting highly qualified personnel. Our product candidates, if successfully developed and approved, may compete with established therapies, with new treatments that may be introduced by our competitors, including competitors relying on our biologics approvals under section 351(k) of the Public Health Service Act, or with generic copies of our products approved by FDA under an abbreviated new drug application (\u201cANDA\u201d), referencing our drug products. We believe that competitors are actively developing competing products to our product candidates. See \u201cCompetition\u201d in the \u201cBusiness\u201d section of this prospectus for a discussion of competition with respect to our current product candidates.\nMany of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater scientific, research, and product development capabilities, as well as greater financial, marketing, sales and human resources capabilities than we do. In addition, many specialized biotechnology firms have formed collaborations with large, established companies to support the research, development and commercialization of products that may be competitive with ours. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful with respect to their products than we may be in developing, commercializing, and achieving widespread market acceptance for our products. If a competitor obtains approval for an orphan drug that is the same drug or the same biologic as one of our candidates before we do, we will be blocked from obtaining FDA approval for seven years from the date of the competitor\u2019s product, unless we can establish that our product is clinically superior to the previously-approved competitor\u2019s product or we can meet another exception, such as by showing that the competitor has failed to provide an adequate supply of its product to patients after approval. In addition, our competitors\u2019 products may be more effective or more effectively marketed and sold than any treatment we or our development partners may commercialize and may render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses related to developing and supporting the commercialization of any of our product candidates. Developments by competitors may render our product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive. After one of our product candidates is approved, FDA may also approve a generic version with the same dosage form, safety, strength, route of administration, quality, performance characteristics and intended use as our product. These generic equivalents would be less costly to bring to market and could generally be offered at lower prices, thereby limiting our ability to gain or retain market share.\nThe acquisition or licensing of pharmaceutical products is also very competitive, and a number of more established companies, which have acknowledged strategies to in-license or acquire products, may have competitive advantages as may other emerging companies taking similar or different approaches to product acquisitions. The more established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash flows, institutional experience and historical corporate reputation.\nWe are subject to a multitude of manufacturing risks, any of which could substantially increase our costs and limit supply of our products.\nWe are wholly dependent on third party contract manufacturers for the timely supply of adequate quantities of our products which meet or exceed requisite quality and production standards for use in clinical and nonclinical studies. Given the extensive risks, scope, complexity, cost, regulatory requirements, and commitment of resources associated with developing the capabilities to manufacture one or more of our products, we have no present plan or intention of developing in-house manufacturing capabilities for nonclinical, clinical or commercial scale production, beyond our current supervision and management of our third-party contract manufacturers. In addition, in order to balance risk and conserve financial and human resources, we have and may continue from time to time to defer commitment to production of product, which could result in delays to the continued progress of our clinical and nonclinical testing.\nIn addition to the foregoing, the process of manufacturing our products is complex, highly regulated, and subject to several risks, including but not limited to the following:\n\u00b7 We, and our contract manufacturers, must comply with FDA\u2019s current Good Manufacturing Practice, (\u201ccGMP\u201d), regulations and guidance. We, and our contract manufacturers, may encounter difficulties in achieving quality control and quality assurance and may experience shortages in qualified personnel. We, and our contract manufacturers, are subject to inspections by FDA and comparable agencies in other jurisdictions to confirm compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. Any failure to follow cGMP or other regulatory requirements or any delay, interruption or other issues that arise in the manufacture, fill-finish, packaging, or storage of our products as a result of a failure of our facilities or the facilities or operations of third parties to comply with regulatory requirements, or a failure to pass any regulatory authority inspection, could significantly impair our ability to develop and commercialize our products, including leading to significant delays in the availability of products for our clinical studies or the termination or hold on a clinical study, or the delay or prevention of a filing or approval of marketing applications for our product candidates. Significant noncompliance could also result in the imposition of sanctions, including injunctions, civil penalties, failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approvals for our product candidates, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions, adverse publicity, and criminal prosecutions, any of which could damage our reputation. If we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may not be permitted to market our products and/or may be subject to product recalls, seizures, injunctions, or criminal prosecution. Any adverse developments affecting manufacturing operations for our products may result in shipment delays, inventory shortages, lot failures, product withdrawals or recalls, or other interruptions in the supply of our products. Once our product candidates are approved, we may also have to take inventory write-offs and incur other charges and expenses for products that fail to meet specifications, undertake costly remediation efforts or seek more costly manufacturing alternatives.\n\u00b7 The manufacturing facilities in which our products are made could be adversely affected by equipment failures, plant closures, capacity constraints, competing customer priorities or changes in corporate strategy or priorities, process changes or failures, changes in business models or operations, materials or labor shortages, natural disasters, power failures and numerous other factors.\n\u00b7 We are wholly dependent upon third party CMOs for the timely supply of adequate quantities of requisite quality product for our nonclinical, clinical and, if approved by regulatory authorities, commercial scale production.\nIf any product candidate that we successfully develop does not achieve broad market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payers and the medical community, the revenue that it generates may be limited.\nEven if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, they may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payers, and the medical community. Coverage and reimbursement of our product candidates by third-party payers, including government payers, generally is also necessary for commercial success. The degree of market acceptance of any approved product candidates will depend on several factors, including:\n\u00b7 the efficacy and safety as demonstrated in clinical trials;\n\u00b7 the clinical indications for which the product candidate is approved;\n\u00b7 acceptance by physicians, major operators of hospitals and clinics, and patients of the product candidate as a safe and effective treatment;\n\u00b7 the potential and perceived advantages of product candidates over alternative treatments;\n\u00b7 the safety of product candidates seen in a broader patient group, including its use outside the approved indications;\n\u00b7 the cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments;\n\u00b7 the availability of adequate reimbursement and pricing by payers;\n\u00b7 relative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u00b7 the prevalence and severity of adverse events;\n\u00b7 the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts; and\n\u00b7 the ability to manage any unfavorable publicity relating to the product candidate.\nIf any product candidate is approved but does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, hospitals, healthcare payers, and patients, we may not generate sufficient revenue from that product candidate and may not become or remain commercially attractive as a standalone indication for that product.\nReimbursement may be limited or unavailable in certain market segments for our product candidates, which could make it difficult for us to sell our product candidates profitably.\nMarket acceptance and sales of our product candidates will depend significantly on the availability of adequate insurance coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers for any of our product candidates and may be affected by existing and future health care reform measures. Government authorities and third-party payers, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Reimbursement by a third-party payer may depend upon a number of factors including the third-party payer\u2019s determination that use of a product candidate is:\n\u00b7 a covered benefit under its health plan;\n\u00b7 safe, effective, and medically necessary;\n\u00b7 appropriate for the specific patient;\n\u00b7 cost-effective; and\n\u00b7 neither experimental nor investigational.\nObtaining coverage and reimbursement approval for a product candidate from a government or other third-party payer is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide supporting scientific, clinical, and cost effectiveness data for the use of our product candidates to the payer. We may not be able to provide data sufficient to gain acceptance with respect to coverage and reimbursement. We cannot be sure that coverage or adequate reimbursement will be available for any of our product candidates. Also, we cannot be sure that reimbursement amounts will not reduce the demand for, or the price of, our product candidates. If reimbursement is not available or is available only to limited levels or with restrictions, we may not be able to commercialize certain of our product candidates profitably, or at all, even if approved.\nIn the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the health care system that could affect our ability to sell our product candidates profitably. In particular, the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 revised the payment methods for many product candidates under Medicare. This has resulted in lower rates of reimbursement. There have been numerous other federal and state initiatives designed to reduce payment for pharmaceuticals.\nAs a result of legislative proposals and the trend toward managed health care in the United States, third-party payers are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement of new drugs. They may also refuse to provide coverage of approved product candidates for medical indications other than those for which FDA has granted market approvals. As a result, significant uncertainty exists as to whether and how much third-party payers will reimburse patients for their use of newly approved drugs, which in turn will put pressure on the pricing of drugs. We could be subject to pricing pressures in connection with the sale of our product candidates due to the trend toward managed health care, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations, and additional legislative proposals as well as country, regional, or local healthcare budget limitations.\nSimilar concerns about the costs of treatment have been raised in Europe and the United Kingdom, where the cost effectiveness of CAR-T therapies have been an impediment to utilization of Kymriah and Yescarta. If CAR-T companies are not able to convince regulators and payers in national healthcare systems that the benefits of a CAR-T therapy outweigh its costs, the market for lenzilumab might not develop.\nGovernments may impose price controls, which may adversely affect our future profitability.\nWe intend to seek approval to market our future product candidates in the United States and potentially in foreign jurisdictions. If we obtain approval in one or more foreign jurisdictions, we will be subject to rules and regulations in those jurisdictions relating to our product candidates. In some foreign countries, particularly in the European Union and the United Kingdom, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals and biologics is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product candidate. If reimbursement of our future products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe face potential product liability exposure and, if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability for a product candidate and may have to limit its commercialization.\nThe use of our product candidates in clinical trials and the sale of any product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval expose us to the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims may be brought against us or any future development partners by participants enrolled in our clinical trials, patients, health care providers, or others using, administering, or selling our product candidates. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against any such claims, or have insufficient insurance protection, we would incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u00b7 withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u00b7 termination of clinical trial sites or entire trial programs;\n\u00b7 costs of related litigation;\n\u00b7 substantial monetary awards to trial participants or other claimants;\n\u00b7 decreased demand for our product candidates and loss of revenue;\n\u00b7 impairment of our business reputation;\n\u00b7 diversion of management and scientific resources from our business operations; and\n\u00b7 the inability to commercialize our product candidates.\nWe have obtained limited product liability insurance coverage for our clinical trials domestically and in selected foreign countries where we are conducting clinical trials. As such, our insurance coverage may not reimburse us or may not be sufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive and in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to product liability. We intend to expand our insurance coverage for product candidates to include the sale of commercial products if we obtain marketing approval for our product candidates in development; however, we may be unable to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any product candidates approved for marketing. Large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us, particularly if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our working capital and adversely affect our business.\nOur employees and consultants may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees or consultants could include intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations or similar regulations of comparable foreign regulatory authorities, failure to provide accurate information to FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, failure to comply with manufacturing standards, failure to comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations and similar laws and regulations established and enforced by comparable foreign regulatory authorities, failure to report financial information or data accurately, violations of anti-bribery laws, or failure to disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Employee or consultant misconduct could also involve the improper use of confidential information obtained in the course of our business, which could result in civil or criminal legal actions, regulatory sanctions, or serious harm to our reputation. We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and other corporate policies, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and results of operations, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nWe may encounter difficulties in managing our growth and expanding our operations successfully.\nAs we seek to advance our product candidates through clinical trials, we will need to expand our development, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing, and sales capabilities, and contract with third parties to provide these capabilities for us. As our operations expand, we expect that we will need to manage additional relationships with various development partners, suppliers, and other third parties. Future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our product candidates and to compete effectively will depend in part on our ability to manage any future growth effectively. To that end, we must be able to manage our development efforts and clinical trials effectively. We may not be able to accomplish these tasks and our failure to accomplish any of them could prevent us from successfully growing our company.\nWe and any future development partners, third-party manufacturers and suppliers use hazardous materials, and any claims relating to improper handling, storage, or disposal of these materials could be time consuming or costly.\nWe and any future development partners, third-party manufacturers and suppliers may use hazardous materials, including chemicals and biological agents and compounds that could be dangerous to human health and safety or the environment. Our operations and the operations of our development partner, third-party manufacturers and suppliers also produce hazardous waste products. Federal, state, and local laws and regulations govern the use, generation, manufacture, storage, handling, and disposal of these materials and wastes. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations may be expensive and current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our product development efforts. In addition, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from these materials or wastes. We do not carry specific biological or hazardous waste insurance coverage and our property, casualty, and general liability insurance policies specifically exclude coverage for damages and fines arising from biological or hazardous waste exposure or contamination. Accordingly, in the event of contamination or injury we could be held liable for damages or be penalized with fines in an amount exceeding our resources, and our clinical trials or regulatory approvals could be suspended.\nHealthcare reform measures, when implemented, could hinder or prevent our commercial success.\nThere have been, and likely will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals at the federal and state levels directed at broadening the availability of health care and containing or lowering the cost of health care. We cannot predict the initiatives that may be adopted in the future. The continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations, and other payers of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of health care may adversely affect:\n\u00b7 the demand for any drug products for which we may obtain regulatory approval;\n\u00b7 our ability to set a price that we believe is fair for our product candidates;\n\u00b7 our ability to generate revenue and achieve or maintain profitability;\n\u00b7 the level of taxes that we are required to pay; and\n\u00b7 the availability of capital.\nWe and any of our future development partners will be required to report to regulatory authorities if any of our approved products cause or contribute to adverse medical events, and any failure to do so would result in sanctions that would materially harm our business.\nIf we and any future development partners are successful in commercializing our products, FDA and foreign regulatory authorities would require that we and any future development partners report certain information about adverse medical events if those products may have caused or contributed to those adverse events. The timing of our obligation to report would be triggered by the date we become aware of the adverse event as well as the nature of the event. We and any future development partners may fail to report adverse events we become aware of within the prescribed timeframe. We and any future development partners may also fail to appreciate that we have become aware of a reportable adverse event, especially if it is not reported to us as an adverse event or if it is an adverse event that is unexpected or removed in time from the use of our products. If we and any future development partners fail to comply with our reporting obligations, FDA or a foreign regulatory authority could take action including criminal prosecution, the imposition of civil monetary penalties, seizure of our products, or delay in approval or clearance of future products.\nOur product candidates for which we intend to seek approval as biologic products may face competition sooner than anticipated.\nWith the enactment of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or the BPCIA, as part of the Affordable Care Act, an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products was created. The abbreviated regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as \u2018\u2018interchangeable\u2019\u2019 based on its similarity to an existing brand product. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be approved by FDA until 12 years after the original branded product was approved under a BLA. The law is complex and is still being interpreted and implemented by FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation, and meaning are subject to uncertainty. While it is uncertain when such processes intended to implement BPCIA may be fully adopted by FDA, any such processes could have a material adverse effect on the future commercial prospects for our biological products.\nWe believe that any of our product candidates approved as biological products under a BLA should qualify for the 12-year period of exclusivity. However, there is a risk that FDA will not consider our product candidates to be reference products for competing products, potentially creating the opportunity for biosimilar competition sooner than anticipated. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for any one of our reference products in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing. Finally, there is a risk that the 12-year exclusivity period could be reduced which could negatively affect our products.\nIn addition, foreign regulatory authorities may also provide for exclusivity periods for approved biological products. For example, biological products in Europe may be eligible for a 10-year period of exclusivity. However, biosimilar products have been approved under a sub-pathway of the centralized procedure since 2006. The pathway allows sponsors of a biosimilar product to seek and obtain regulatory approval based in part on the clinical trial data of an originator product to which the biosimilar product has been demonstrated to be \u2018\u2018similar.\u2019\u2019 In many cases, this allows biosimilar products to be brought to market without conducting the full suite of clinical trials typically required of originators. It is unclear whether we and our development partner would face competition to our products in European markets sooner than anticipated.\nWe may in the future be subject to various U.S. federal and state laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback, self-referral, false claims and fraud laws, and any violations by us of such laws could result in fines or other penalties.\nIf one or more of our product candidates is approved, we will likely be subject to the various U.S. federal and state laws intended to prevent health care fraud and abuse. The federal anti-kickback statute prohibits the offer, receipt, or payment of remuneration in exchange for or to induce the referral of patients or the use of products or services that would be paid for in whole or part by Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal health care programs. Remuneration has been broadly defined to include anything of value, including cash, improper discounts, and free or reduced-price items and services. Many states have similar laws that apply to their state health care programs as well as private payers. Violations of the anti-kickback laws can result in exclusion from federal health care programs and substantial civil and criminal penalties.\nThe False Claims Act imposes liability on persons who, among other things, present or cause to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment by a federal health care program. The False Claims Act has been used to prosecute persons submitting claims for payment that are inaccurate or fraudulent, that are for services not provided as claimed, or for services that are not medically necessary. The False Claims Act includes a whistleblower provision that allows individuals to bring actions on behalf of the federal government and share a portion of the recovery of successful claims. If our marketing or other arrangements were determined to violate the False Claims Act or anti-kickback or related laws, then our revenue could be adversely affected, which would likely harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nState and federal authorities have aggressively targeted medical technology companies for alleged violations of these anti-fraud statutes, based on improper research or consulting contracts with doctors, certain marketing arrangements that rely on volume-based pricing, off-label marketing schemes, and other improper promotional practices. Companies targeted in such prosecutions have paid substantial fines in the hundreds of millions of dollars or more, have been forced to implement extensive corrective action plans or corporate integrity agreements, and have often become subject to consent decrees severely restricting the manner in which they conduct their business. If we become the target of such an investigation or prosecution based on our contractual relationships with providers or institutions, or our marketing and promotional practices, we could face similar sanctions, which would materially harm our business.\nAlso, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from reckless or negligent acts committed by our employees, future distributors, partners, collaborators, or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could result in fines, penalties, or prosecution and have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation.\nLegislative or regulatory healthcare reforms in the United States may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates and to produce, market, and distribute our products after approval is obtained.\nFrom time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the regulatory approval, manufacture, and marketing of regulated products or the reimbursement thereof. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by FDA in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. Any new regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of our current product candidates or any future product candidates. We cannot determine what effect changes in regulations, statutes, legal interpretation, or policies, when and if promulgated, enacted or adopted may have on our business in the future. Such changes could, among other things, require:\n\u00b7 changes to manufacturing methods;\n\u00b7 additional studies, including clinical studies;\n\u00b7 recall, replacement, or discontinuance of one or more of our products; and\n\u00b7 additional record-keeping.\nEach of these would likely entail substantial time and cost and could materially harm our business and our financial results. In addition, delays in receipt of or failure to receive regulatory approvals for any future products would harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nEven if we are able to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, we will continue to be subject to ongoing and extensive regulatory requirements, and our failure to comply with these requirements could substantially harm our business.\nIf we receive regulatory approval for our product candidates, we will be subject to ongoing FDA obligations and continued regulatory oversight and review, such as continued safety reporting requirements, and we may also be subject to additional FDA post-marketing obligations. If we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may not be permitted to market our product candidates and/or may be subject to product recalls or seizures.\nIf the FDA approves any of our product candidates, the labeling, manufacturing, packaging, storage, distribution, export, adverse event reporting, advertising, promotion and record-keeping for our products will be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. Violations of these regulatory requirements or the subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with the products, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, may result in:\n\u00b7 the issuance of warning or untitled letters;\n\u00b7 requirements to conduct post-marking clinical trials;\n\u00b7 restrictions on the marketing and distribution of the product, including potential withdrawal of the product from the market;\n\u00b7 suspension of ongoing clinical trials;\n\u00b7 the issuance of product recalls, import and export restrictions, seizures, and detentions; and\n\u00b7 the issuance of injunctions, or imposition of other civil and/or criminal penalties.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be subject to certain limitations.\nWe have incurred substantial losses during our history and do not expect to become profitable in the foreseeable future and may never achieve profitability. To the extent that we continue to generate taxable losses, unused losses will carry forward to offset future taxable income, if any, until such unused losses expire. We may be unable to use these losses to offset income before such unused losses expire. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted in 2017, limited the use of net operating loss carryforwards for periods beginning after 2017 to eighty percent of taxable income in the period to which the losses were carried. However, this limitation on the use of the carryforwards was eliminated by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES\u201d Act) for tax years beginning before January 1, 2021. In addition, Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, may limit the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards. Under Section 382, if a corporation undergoes an \u2018\u2018ownership change\u2019\u2019 (generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period), the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. We have recently and in the past experienced ownership changes that have resulted in limitations on the use of a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards. If we experience further ownership changes our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards could be further limited.\nWe rely completely on third parties, most of which are sole source suppliers, to supply drug substance and manufacture drug product for our clinical trials and preclinical studies and intend to rely on other third parties to produce commercial supplies of product candidates, and our dependence on third parties could adversely impact our business.\nWe are completely dependent on third-party suppliers, most of which are sole source suppliers of the drug substance and drug product for our product candidates. We regularly evaluate potential alternate sources of supply but there can be no assurance that any such suppliers would be available, acceptable, or successful. The costs of manufacturing our drug candidates are high, and we will require additional capital to ensure that we can maintain an adequate supply to conduct our contemplated development programs.\nIf our third-party suppliers do not supply sufficient quantities for product candidates to us on a timely basis and in accordance with applicable specifications and other regulatory requirements, there could be a significant interruption of our supplies, which would adversely affect clinical development of the product candidate, including affecting our ability to enroll in and timely progress clinical trials. Furthermore, if any of our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and with regulatory requirements, we will not be able to secure and/or maintain regulatory approval, if any, for our product candidates.\nWe will also rely on our contract manufacturers to purchase from third-party suppliers the materials necessary to produce our product candidates for our anticipated clinical trials. There are a small number of suppliers for certain capital equipment and raw materials used to manufacture our product candidates. We do not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these raw materials by our contract manufacturers. Moreover, we currently do not have agreements in place for the commercial production of these raw materials. Any significant delay in the supply of a product candidate or the raw material components thereof for an ongoing clinical trial could considerably delay completion of that clinical trial, product candidate testing, and potential regulatory approval of that product candidate.\nWe do not expect to have the resources or capacity to commercially manufacture any of our proposed product candidates, if approved, and will likely continue to be dependent on third-party manufacturers. Our dependence on third parties to manufacture and supply us with clinical trial materials and any approved product candidates may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates on a timely basis.\nWe may not be successful in establishing and maintaining development partnerships and licensing agreements, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize product candidates.\nPart of our strategy is to enter into development partnerships and licensing agreements. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate partners and the negotiation process is time consuming and complex. Even if we are successful in securing a development partnership, we may not be able to continue it. Moreover, we may not be successful in our efforts to establish a development partnership or other alternative arrangements for any of our other existing or future product candidates and programs because, among other reasons, our research and development pipeline may be insufficient, our product candidates and programs may be deemed to be at too early a stage of development for collaborative effort and/or third parties may not view our product candidates and programs as having the requisite potential to demonstrate safety and efficacy. Even if we are successful in our efforts to establish new development partnerships, the terms that we agree upon may not be favorable to us and we may not be able to maintain such development partnerships if, for example, development or approval of a product candidate is delayed or sales of an approved product candidate are disappointing. Any delay in entering into new development partnership agreements related to our product candidates could delay the development and commercialization of our product candidates and reduce their competitiveness if they reach the market.\nMoreover, if we fail to establish and maintain additional development partnerships related to our product candidates:\n\u00b7 the development of our current or future product candidates may be terminated or delayed;\n\u00b7 our cash expenditures related to development of certain of our current or future product candidates would increase significantly and we may need to seek additional financing;\n\u00b7 we may be required to hire additional employees or otherwise develop expertise, such as sales and marketing expertise, for which we have not budgeted; and\n\u00b7 we will bear all of the risk related to the development of any such product candidates.\nOur or any new partner\u2019s failure to develop, manufacture or effectively commercialize our product would result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and would likely cause our stock price to decline.\nCurrently pending, threatened or future litigation or governmental proceedings or inquiries could result in material adverse consequences, including judgments or settlements.\nWe are, or may from time to time become, involved in lawsuits and other legal or governmental proceedings. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding currently pending litigation that could have a material impact on the Company. Many of these matters raise complicated factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties and complexities, all of which make the matters costly to address. The timing of the final resolutions to any such lawsuits, inquiries, and other legal proceedings is uncertain.\nAdditionally, the possible outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse judgments or settlements, either of which could require substantial payments, adversely affecting our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Any judgment against us, the entry into any settlement agreement, or the imposition of any fine could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFuture acquisitions of and investments in new businesses could impact our business and financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we may acquire or invest in businesses or partnerships that we believe could complement our business and drug candidates. The pursuit of such acquisitions or investments may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses, regardless of whether the acquisition or investment is ultimately completed. In addition, acquisitions and investments may not perform as expected and we may be unable to realize the expected benefits, synergies, or developments that we may initially anticipate. Further, if we are able to successfully identify and acquire additional businesses, we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired personnel or operations, or effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition, any of which could harm our business and financial condition.\nIn addition, to the extent we finance any acquisition or investment in cash, it would reduce our cash reserves, and to the extent the purchase price is paid with shares of our common or preferred stock, it could be dilutive to our current stockholders. To the extent we finance any acquisition or investment with the proceeds from the incurrence of debt, this would increase our level of indebtedness and could negatively affect our liquidity, credit rating and restrict our operations. Moreover, we may face contingent liabilities in connection with any acquisitions or investments.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nIf we fail to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or secure rights to patents of others, the value of our intellectual property rights would diminish, and our business and competitive position would suffer.\nOur success, competitive position and future revenues will depend in part on our ability and the abilities of our licensors and licensees to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products, methods, processes and other technologies, to preserve our trade secrets, to prevent third parties from infringing on our proprietary rights and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. We have an active patent protection program that includes filing patent applications on new compounds, formulations, delivery systems and methods of making and using products and prosecuting these patent applications in the United States and abroad. As patents issue, we also file continuation applications as appropriate. Although we have taken steps to build what we believe to be a strong patent portfolio, we cannot predict:\n\u00b7 the degree and range of protection any patents will afford us against competitors, including whether third parties find ways to invalidate or otherwise circumvent our licensed patents;\n\u00b7 if and when patents will issue in the United States or any other country;\n\u00b7 whether or not others will obtain patents claiming aspects similar to those covered by our licensed patents and patent applications;\n\u00b7 whether we will need to initiate litigation or administrative proceedings to protect our intellectual property rights, which may be costly whether we win or lose;\n\u00b7 whether any of our patents will be challenged by our competitors alleging invalidity or unenforceability and, if opposed or litigated, the outcome of any administrative or court action as to patent validity, enforceability or scope;\n\u00b7 whether a competitor will develop a similar compound that is outside the scope of protection afforded by a patent or whether the patent scope is inherent in the claims modified due to interpretation of claim scope by a court;\n\u00b7 whether there were activities previously undertaken by a licensor that could limit the scope, validity or enforceability of licensed patents and intellectual property; or\n\u00b7 whether a competitor will assert infringement of its patents or intellectual property, whether or not meritorious, and what the outcome of any related litigation or challenge may be.\nOur success also depends upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, our consultants and advisors as well as our licensors, sublicensees and contractors. To help protect our proprietary know-how and our inventions for which patents may be unobtainable or difficult to obtain, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements. To this end, we require all employees, consultants and board members to enter into agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business. These agreements may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure or the lawful development by others of such information. If any of our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information is disclosed, the value of our trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary rights would be significantly impaired, and our business and competitive position would suffer.\nDue to legal and factual uncertainties regarding the scope and protection afforded by patents and other proprietary rights, we may not have meaningful protection from competition.\nOur long-term success will substantially depend upon our ability to protect our proprietary technologies from infringement, misappropriation, discovery and duplication and avoid infringing the proprietary rights of others. Our patent rights, and the patent rights of biopharmaceutical companies in general, are highly uncertain and include complex legal and factual issues. These uncertainties also mean that any patents that we own or may obtain in the future could be subject to challenge, and even if not challenged, may not provide us with meaningful protection from competition. Patents already issued to us or our pending applications may become subject to dispute, and any dispute could be resolved against us.\nIf some or all of our or any licensor\u2019s patents expire or are invalidated or are found to be unenforceable, or if some or all of our patent applications do not result in issued patents or result in patents with narrow, overbroad, or unenforceable claims, or claims that are not supported in regard to written description or enablement by the specification, or if we are prevented from asserting that the claims of an issued patent cover a product of a third party, we may be subject to competition from third parties with products in the same class of products as our product candidates or products with the same active pharmaceutical ingredients as our product candidates, including in those jurisdictions in which we have no patent protection.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection for our product candidates, as well as the methods for treating patients in the product indications using these product candidates. We will be able to protect our product candidates and the methods for treating patients in the applicable product indications using these product candidates from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that we or our exclusive licensor owns or controls such valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets.\nEven if our product candidates and the methods for treating patients for prescribed indications using these product candidates are covered by valid and enforceable patents and have claims with sufficient scope, disclosure and support in the specification, the patents will provide protection only for a limited amount of time. Our and any licensor\u2019s ability to obtain patents can be highly uncertain and involve complex and in some cases unsettled legal issues and factual questions. Furthermore, different countries have different procedures for obtaining patents, and patents issued in different countries provide different degrees of protection against the use of a patented invention by others. Therefore, if the issuance to us or any licensor, in a given country, of a patent covering an invention is not followed by the issuance, in other countries, of patents covering the same invention, or if any judicial interpretation of the validity, enforceability, or scope of the claims in, or the utility, written description or enablement in, a patent issued in one country is not similar to the interpretation given to the corresponding patent issued in another country, our ability to protect our intellectual property in those countries may be limited. Changes in either patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may materially diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection.\nWe may be subject to competition from third parties with products in the same class of products as our product candidates, or products with the same active pharmaceutical ingredients as our product candidates in those jurisdictions in which we have no patent protection. Even if patents are issued to us or any licensor regarding our product or methods of using them, those patents can be challenged by our competitors who can argue such patents are invalid or unenforceable on a variety of grounds, including lack of utility, lack sufficient written description or enablement, utility, or that the claims of the issued patents should be limited or narrowly construed. Patents also will not protect our product candidates if competitors devise ways of making or using these products without legally infringing our patents. The current U.S. regulatory environment may have the effect of encouraging companies to challenge branded drug patents or to create non-infringing versions of a patented product in order to facilitate the approval of ANDAs for generic substitutes. These same types of incentives encourage competitors to submit NDAs that rely on literature and clinical data not prepared for or by the drug sponsor, providing another less burdensome pathway to approval.\nIf we infringe the rights of third parties, we could be prevented from selling products and be forced to defend against litigation and pay damages.\nThere is a risk that we are infringing the proprietary rights of third parties because numerous United States and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields that are the focus of our development and manufacturing efforts. Others might have been the first to make the inventions covered by each of our or any licensor\u2019s pending patent applications and issued patents and/or might have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions. In addition, because patent applications take many months to publish and patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us or any licensor, which may later result in issued patents that cover the production, manufacture, synthesis, commercialization, formulation or use of our product candidates. In addition, the production, manufacture, synthesis, commercialization, formulation or use of our product candidates may infringe existing patents of which we are not aware. Defending ourselves against third-party claims, including litigation in particular, would be costly and time consuming and would divert management\u2019s attention from our business, which could lead to delays in our development or commercialization efforts. If third parties are successful in their claims, we might have to pay substantial damages or take other actions that are adverse to our business.\nIf our products, methods, processes and other technologies infringe the proprietary rights of other parties, we could incur substantial costs and may have to:\n\u00b7 obtain licenses, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all;\n\u00b7 redesign our products or processes to avoid infringement, which may not be possible or could require substantial funds and time;\n\u00b7 stop using the subject matter claimed in patents held by others, which could cause us to lose the use of one or more of our drug candidates;\n\u00b7 pay damages royalties, or other amounts; or\n\u00b7 grant a cross license to our patents to another patent holder.\nWe expect that, as our drug candidates move further into clinical trials and commercialization and our public profile is raised, we will be more likely to be subject to such claims.\nWe may fail to comply with any of our obligations under existing agreements pursuant to which we license or have otherwise acquired rights or technology, which could result in the loss of rights or technology that are material to our business.\nWe are a party to technology licenses and have acquired certain assets and rights that are important to our business and we may enter into additional licenses or acquire additional assets and rights in the future. We currently hold licenses from Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research (\u201cLICR\u201d), BioWa, Inc. (\u201cBioWa\u201d), Lonza Sales AG (\u201cLonza\u201d) Mayo Foundation (\u201cMayo\u201d) and the University of Zurich (\u201cUZH\u201d). These licenses impose various commercial, contingent payments, royalty, insurance, indemnification, and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with these obligations, the licensor may have the right to terminate the license or take back rights or assets, in which event we would lose valuable rights under our collaboration agreements, potential claims and our ability to develop product candidates.\nWe may be subject to claims that our consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their other clients or former employers to us.\nAs is common in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry, we engage the services of consultants to assist us in the development of our product candidates. Many of these consultants were previously employed at or may have previously or may be currently providing consulting services to, other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies including our competitors or potential competitors. We may become subject to claims that our company or a consultant inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other information proprietary to their former employers or their former or current clients. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to our management team.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and we intend to seek patent protection only in selected countries. Our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our product candidates and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biopharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nA significant portion of our total outstanding shares are eligible to be sold into the market in the near future, which could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our future ability to obtain capital, especially through an offering of equity securities. In addition, holders of a substantial number of shares of our common stock have rights, subject to certain conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders.\nWe also have registered all shares of common stock that we may issue under our equity compensation plans or that are issuable upon exercise of outstanding options. These shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance and once vested, subject to volume limitations applicable to affiliates. If any of these additional shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nWe have also entered into a Controlled Equity OfferingSM Sales Agreement (the \u201cSales Agreement\u201d) with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., under which we may issue and sell from time to time shares of common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $100,000,000 through Cantor Fitzgerald, as sales agent. Sales of a substantial number of shares under the Sales Agreement, or the perception that those sales may occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nFurther, certain shares of our common stock that are currently outstanding but have not been registered for resale may currently be sold under Rule 144 under the Securities Act or the Securities Act. Sales of a substantial number of these shares in the public market, or the perception that those sales may occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nOur executive officers, directors and principal stockholders, if they choose to act together, will continue to have the ability to significantly influence all matters submitted to stockholders for approval, and this concentration of ownership may contribute to volatility in our stock price.\nWe have a relatively small public float due to the ownership percentage of our executive officers and directors, and greater than 5% stockholders. Our directors, executive officers, and the other holders of more than 5% of our common stock together with their affiliates beneficially owned approximately 50.7% of our common stock as of March 5, 2021.\nSome of these persons or entities may have interests that are different from our other stockholders, which could prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that may be in the best interest of our other stockholders. This may also adversely affect the trading price of our common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with a significant concentration of ownership.\nAs a result of our small public float, our common stock may be less liquid, experience reduced daily trading volume and have greater stock price volatility than the common stock of companies with broader public ownership. In addition, the trading of a relatively small volume of shares of our common stock may result in significant volatility in our stock price. If and to the extent ownership of our common stock becomes more concentrated, whether due to increased ownership by our directors and executive officers or other principal stockholders, or other factors, our public float would further decrease, which in turn would likely result in increased stock price volatility.\nAdditionally, because a large amount of our stock is closely held, we may experience low trading volume or large fluctuations in share price and volume due to sales by our principal stockholders. If our existing stockholders, particularly our directors, executive officers and the holders of more than 5% of our common stock, or their affiliates or associates, sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or are perceived by the public market as intending to sell substantial amounts of our common stock, the trading price of our common stock could decline significantly.\nDespite our listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for our common stock will develop or be sustained, and the Nasdaq Capital Market may subsequently delist our common stock if we fail to comply with ongoing listing standards.\nOn September 18, 2020, our common stock commenced trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \u201cHGEN.\u201d The Nasdaq Capital Market\u2019s rules for listed companies will require us to meet certain financial, public float, bid price and liquidity standards on an ongoing basis in order to continue the listing of our common stock. To satisfy the initial listing standards for the Nasdaq Capital Market, we have had to execute a reverse stock split. In addition to specific listing and maintenance standards, the Nasdaq Capital Market has broad discretionary authority over the continued listing of securities, which it could exercise with respect to the listing of our common stock.\nAs a listed company, we are required to meet the continued listing requirements applicable to all Nasdaq Capital Market companies. If we fail to meet those standards, as applied by Nasdaq in its discretion, our common stock may be subject to delisting. We intend to take all commercially reasonable actions to maintain our Nasdaq listing. If our common stock is delisted in the future, it is not likely that we will be able to list our common stock on another national securities exchange and, as a result, we expect our securities would be quoted on an over-the-counter market; however, if this were to occur, our stockholders could face significant material adverse consequences, including limited availability of market quotations for our common stock and reduced liquidity for the trading of our securities. In addition, in the event of such delisting, we could experience a decreased ability to issue additional securities and obtain additional financing in the future.\nThe National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as \u201ccovered securities.\u201d Because our common stock is listed on Nasdaq, shares of our common stock qualify as covered securities under the statute. Although the states are preempted from regulating the sale of our securities, the federal statute does allow the states to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud, and, if there is a finding of fraudulent activity, then the states can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case. Further, if we were no longer listed on Nasdaq, our securities would not qualify as covered securities under the statute, and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities.\nFurther, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for our common stock will be sustained despite our listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nRaising additional funds by issuing securities or through licensing or lending arrangements may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, the share ownership of existing stockholders will be diluted. To the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance could result in further dilution to our stockholders by causing a reduction in their proportionate ownership and voting power.\nAny future debt financing may involve covenants that restrict our operations, including, among other restrictions, limitations on our ability to incur liens or additional debt, pay dividends, redeem our stock, make certain investments, and engage in certain merger, consolidation, or asset sale transactions. In addition, if we raise additional funds through licensing arrangements, it may be necessary to grant potentially valuable rights to our product candidates or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nAny material weaknesses in our internal control over financing reporting that we may identify in the future could adversely affect investor confidence, impair the value of our common stock and increase our cost of raising capital.\nIf we were to identify any material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting in the future, our operating results might be harmed, we may fail to meet our reporting obligations or fail to prevent or detect material misstatements in our financial statements. Any such failure could, in turn, affect the future ability of our management to certify that internal control over our financial reporting is effective. Inferior internal control over financial reporting could also subject us to the scrutiny of the SEC and other regulatory bodies which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and could subject us to civil or criminal penalties or stockholder litigation, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting, the disclosure of that fact, even if quickly remedied, could reduce the market\u2019s confidence in our financial statements and harm our share price. Furthermore, deficiencies could result in future non-compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Such non-compliance could subject us to a variety of administrative sanctions, including review by the SEC or other regulatory authorities.\nOur stock price is volatile and purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors. These factors include those discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of this prospectus and others such as:\n\u00b7 delay or failure in initiating or completing preclinical studies or clinical trials, or unsatisfactory results of these trials and the resulting impact on ongoing product development;\n\u00b7 the success, progress, timing and costs of our efforts to evaluate or consummate various strategic alternatives if in the best interests of our stockholders;\n\u00b7 our ability to maintain the listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market;\n\u00b7 announcements regarding equity or debt financing transactions;\n\u00b7 sales or potential sales of substantial amounts of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock;\n\u00b7 announcements or social media comments about us or about our competitors including clinical trial results, regulatory approvals, or new product candidate introductions;\n\u00b7 developments concerning our development partner, licensors or product candidate manufacturers;\n\u00b7 litigation and other developments relating to our patents or other proprietary rights or those of our competitors;\n\u00b7 conditions in the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries and the economy as a whole;\n\u00b7 governmental regulation and legislation;\n\u00b7 recruitment or departure of members of our board of directors, management team or other key personnel;\n\u00b7 changes in our operating results;\n\u00b7 any financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections, our failure to meet these projections, or changes in recommendations by any securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock;\n\u00b7 change in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our performance, or our failure to meet analysts\u2019 expectations; and\n\u00b7 price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market or resulting from inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares.\nIn recent years, the stock market in general, and the market for pharmaceutical and biotechnological companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to changes in the operating performance of the companies whose stock is experiencing those price and volume fluctuations. Broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nIn addition, public statements by us, government agencies, traditional and social media or others relating to the COVID-19 pandemic (including currently authorized vaccines and therapeutics and efforts to develop additional COVID-19 vaccines, treatments or therapies) have in the past resulted, and may in the future result, in significant fluctuations in our stock price. Given the global focus on the COVID-19 pandemic, any information in the public arena on this topic, whether or not accurate, could have an outsized impact (either positive or negative) on our stock price. Information related to our Phase 3 trial of lenzilumab, the ACTIV-5 trial or our development, manufacturing and distribution efforts with respect to lenzilumab, or information regarding such efforts by competitors, may also impact our stock price.\nWe have never paid and do not intend to pay cash dividends and, consequently, the ability to achieve a return on any investment in our common stock will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on any of our capital stock, and we currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. Therefore, a holder of our stock is not likely to receive any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Since we do not intend to pay dividends, the ability to receive a return on an investment in our common stock will depend on any future appreciation in the market value of our common stock. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate or even maintain the price at which it was purchased.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law, could discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock.\nWe are a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the \u201cCharter\u201d), and our Second Amended and Restated Bylaws (the \u201cBylaws\u201d) may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable. Our Charter and Bylaws:\n\u00b7 provide that vacancies on our board of directors, including newly created directorships, may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office;\n\u00b7 do not provide stockholders with the ability to cumulate their votes; and\n\u00b7 require advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals.\nIn addition, our Charter permits the Board to issue up to 25 million shares of preferred stock with such powers, rights, terms and conditions as may be designated by the Board upon the issuance of shares of preferred stock at one or more times in the future. Specifically, the Charter permits the Board to approve the future issuance of all or any shares of the preferred stock in one or more series, to determine the number of shares constituting any series and to determine any voting powers, conversion rights, dividend rights, and other designations, preferences, limitations, restrictions and rights relating to such shares without any further authorization by our stockholders. The Board\u2019s power to issue preferred stock could have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a transaction or a change in control of our company that might otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur internal computer systems, or those of our third-party vendors, collaborators or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of our product development programs, compromise sensitive information related to our business or prevent us from accessing critical information, potentially exposing us to liability or otherwise adversely affecting our business.\nOur internal computer systems and those of our current and any future third-party vendors, collaborators and other contractors or consultants are vulnerable to damage or interruption from computer viruses, computer hackers, malicious code, employee theft or misuse, denial-of-service attacks, sophisticated nation-state and nation-state-supported actors, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. While we seek to protect our information technology systems from system failure, accident and security breach, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a disruption of our development programs and our business operations, whether due to a loss of our trade secrets or other proprietary information or other disruptions. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. If we were to experience a significant cybersecurity breach of our information systems or data, the costs associated with the investigation, remediation and potential notification of the breach to counterparties and data subjects could be material. In addition, our remediation efforts may not be successful. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology and cybersecurity infrastructure, we could suffer significant business disruption, including transaction errors, supply chain or manufacturing interruptions, processing inefficiencies, data loss or the loss of or damage to intellectual property or other proprietary information.\nTo the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our or our third-party vendors\u2019, collaborators\u2019 or other contractors\u2019 or consultants\u2019 data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability including litigation exposure, penalties and fines, we could become the subject of regulatory action or investigation, our competitive position could be harmed and the further development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed. Any of the above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nOur insurance policies are expensive and protect us only from some business risks, which leaves us exposed to significant uninsured liabilities.\nWe do not carry insurance for all categories of risk that our business may encounter. Some of the policies we currently maintain include general liability, employment practices liability, property, inventory and cargo, auto, workers\u2019 compensation, products liability, and directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance. We do not know, however, if we will be able to maintain existing insurance with adequate levels of coverage. Any significant, uninsured liability may require us to pay substantial amounts, which would adversely affect our working capital and results of operations.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or publish unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for a company\u2019s common stock often is based in part on the research and reports that securities and industry analysts publish about the company. If additional analyst coverage does develop, and an analyst downgrades our stock or publishes unfavorable research about our business, or if our clinical trials or operating results fail to meet the analysts\u2019 expectations, our stock price would likely decline.\nChanges in laws or regulations relating to data privacy and security, or any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such laws and regulations, or contractual or other obligations relating to data privacy and security, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are, and may increasingly become, subject to various laws and regulations, as well as contractual obligations, relating to data privacy and security in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The regulatory environment related to data privacy and security is increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. These laws and regulations may be interpreted and applied differently over time and from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and it is possible that they will be interpreted and applied in ways that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nIn the United States, various federal and state regulators, including governmental agencies like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal Trade Commission, have adopted, or are considering adopting, laws and regulations concerning personal information and data security. In particular, regulations promulgated pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d) establish privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of protected health information and require the implementation of safeguards to protect the privacy, integrity and availability of protected health information. Determining whether protected health information has been handled in compliance with applicable privacy standards and our contractual obligations can be complex and may be subject to changing interpretation. If we fail to comply with applicable HIPAA privacy and security standards, we could face civil and criminal penalties. In addition, state attorneys general are authorized to bring civil actions seeking either injunctions or damages in response to violations that threaten the privacy of state residents. We cannot be sure how these regulations will be interpreted, enforced or applied to our operations.\nCertain state laws may be more stringent or broader in scope, or offer greater individual rights, with respect to personal information than federal, international, or other state laws, and such laws may differ from each other, all of which may complicate compliance efforts. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which increases privacy rights for California residents and imposes obligations on companies that process their personal information, came into effect on January 1, 2020. Among other things, the CCPA requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers and provide such consumers new data protection and privacy rights, including the ability to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for certain data breaches that result in the loss of personal information. This private right of action may increase the likelihood of, and risks associated with, data breach litigation.\nInternationally, laws, regulations and standards in many jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, use, retention, security, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal information. For example, the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which became effective in May 2018, greatly increased the European Commission\u2019s jurisdictional reach of its laws and adds a broad array of requirements for handling personal data. EU member states are tasked under the GDPR to enact, and have enacted, certain implementing legislation that adds to and/or further interprets the GDPR requirements and potentially extends our obligations and potential liability for failing to meet such obligations. The GDPR, together with national legislation, regulations and guidelines of the EU member states governing the processing of personal data, impose strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, use, retain, protect, disclose, transfer and otherwise process personal data. In particular, the GDPR includes obligations and restrictions concerning the consent and rights of individuals to whom the personal data relates, the transfer of personal data out of the European Economic Area, security breach notifications and the security and confidentiality of personal data. The GDPR authorizes fines for certain violations of up to 4% of global annual revenue or \u20ac20 million, whichever is greater.\nAll of these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs, such as costs related to organizational changes, implementing additional protection technologies, training associates and engaging consultants, which are likely to increase over time. In addition, such requirements may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies, distract management or divert resources from other initiatives and projects, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with any applicable federal, state or similar foreign laws and regulations relating to data privacy and security could result in damage to our reputation and our relationship with our customers, as well as proceedings or litigation by governmental agencies or customers, including class action privacy litigation in certain jurisdictions, which would subject us to significant fines, sanctions, awards, penalties or judgments, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nWe review and explore strategic alternatives on an on-going basis, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying or completing any strategic alternative or that any such strategic alternative will yield additional value for our stockholders.\nWe regularly review strategic alternatives to ensure our current structure optimizes our ability to execute our strategic plan and to maximize stockholder value. The review of strategic alternatives could result in, among other things, a sale, merger, consolidation or business combination, asset divestiture, partnering, licensing or other collaboration agreements, or potential acquisitions or recapitalizations, in one or more transactions, or continuing to operate with our current business plan and strategy. There can be no assurance that the exploration of strategic alternatives will result in the identification or consummation of any transaction.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial expenses associated with identifying and evaluating potential strategic alternatives. The process of exploring strategic alternatives may be time consuming and disruptive to our business operations and if we are unable to effectively manage the process, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We also cannot assure that any potential transaction or other strategic alternative, if identified, evaluated and consummated, will provide greater value to our stockholders than that reflected in our current stock price. Any potential transaction would be dependent upon a number of factors that may be beyond our control, including, among other factors, market conditions, industry trends, the interest of third parties in our business or product candidates and the availability of financing to potential buyers on reasonable terms.", "PERMNO": 13755, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "HGEN"}
