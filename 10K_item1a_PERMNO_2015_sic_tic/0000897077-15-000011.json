{"cik": "897077", "company": "ALAMO GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-06", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider each of the risks described below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making an investment decision with respect to the Company\u2019s securities. If any of the following risks develop into actual events, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results from operations could be materially and adversely affected and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks related to our business\nDeterioration of industry conditions could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business depends to a large extent upon the prospects for the mowing, right-of-way maintenance and agricultural markets in general. Future prospects of the industry depend largely on factors outside of our control. Any of those factors could adversely impact demand for our products, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. These factors include the following:\n\u2022\nweakness in worldwide economy;\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of raw materials, purchased components and energy;\n\u2022\nbudget constraints and revenue shortfalls for our governmental customers;\n\u2022\nchanges in domestic and foreign governmental policies and laws, including increased levels of governmental regulation;\n\u2022\nthe levels of interest rates;\n\u2022\nthe value of the U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currencies in countries where we sell our products but don\u2019t have a manufacturing presence;\n\u2022\nimpact of tighter credit markets on the Company, its dealers and end-users;\n\u2022\nimpairment in the carrying value of goodwill; and\n\u2022\nincrease in unfunded pension plan liability due to financial market deterioration.\nIn addition, our business is susceptible to a number of factors that specifically affect agricultural customer spending patterns, including the following:\n\u2022\nanimal disease outbreaks, epidemics and crop pests;\n\u2022\nweather conditions, such as droughts, floods and snowstorms;\n\u2022\nchanges in farm incomes;\n\u2022\ncattle and agricultural commodity prices;\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental agricultural policies worldwide;\n\u2022\nthe level of worldwide farm output and demand for farm products; and\n\u2022\nlimits on agricultural imports/exports.\nA downturn in general economic conditions and outlook in the United States and around the world could adversely affect our net sales and earnings.\nThe strength and profitability of our business depends on the overall demand for our products and upon economic conditions and outlook, including but not limited to economic growth rates; consumer spending levels; financing availability, pricing and terms for our dealers and end-users; employment rates; interest rates; inflation; consumer confidence and general economic and political conditions and expectations in the United States and the other economies in which we conduct business. Slow or negative growth rates, inflationary pressures, higher commodity costs and energy prices, reduced credit availability or unfavorable credit terms for our dealers and end-user customers, increased unemployment rates, and continued recessionary economic conditions and outlook could cause consumers to continue to reduce spending, which may cause them to delay or forgo purchases of our products and could have an adverse effect on our net sales and earnings.\nWe depend on governmental sales and a decrease in such sales could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nA substantial portion of our revenues is derived from sales to federal, state and local governmental entities and related contractors, both in the U.S. and in other countries in which we sell our products. These sales depend primarily on the levels of budgeted and appropriated expenditures for highway, airport, roadside and parks maintenance by various governmental entities and are affected by changes in local and national economic conditions.\nOur dependence on, and the price and availability of, raw materials as well as purchased components may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to fluctuations in market prices for raw materials such as steel and energy. In addition, although most of the raw materials and purchase components we use are commercially available from a number of sources, we could experience disruptions in the availability of such materials. If we are unable to purchase materials we require or are unable to pass on price increases to our customers or otherwise reduce our cost of goods sold, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. In addition, higher energy costs could negatively affect spending by farmers, including their purchases of our products.\nImpairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis. This analysis requires the Company to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, discount rates and growth rates. The cash flows are estimated over a significant future period of time, which makes those estimates and assumptions subject to an even higher degree of uncertainty. The Company also utilizes market valuation models and other financial ratios, which require the Company to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to its assets and businesses. As of December 31, 2014, goodwill was $72,407,000, which represents 12% of total assets.\nThe Company recognized no goodwill impairment in 2014 or 2013. The Company recognized goodwill impairment at one of its French operations, Faucheux, of $656,000 in 2012. The primary reason for the goodwill impairment in 2012 was the general economic downturn that affected the Company's European operations. This caused the Company to revise its expectations about future revenue, which is a significant factor in the discounted cash flow analysis used to estimate the fair value of the Company's reporting units. During the 2014 impairment analysis review, we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 15% decline in the fair value of each reporting unit as of December 31, 2014 would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any of the reporting units.\nWe are significantly dependent on information technology.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit, and store electronic and financial information, to manage a variety of business processes and activities, and to comply with regulatory, legal, and tax requirements. We also depend on our information technology infrastructure for digital marketing activities and for electronic communications among our locations, personnel, customers, and suppliers. These information technology systems, (some of which are provided and maintained by third parties), may be susceptible to damage, disruptions, or shutdowns due to hardware failures, computer viruses, hacker attacks, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophic events or other factors. If our information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption, or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience business disruptions, transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, and the loss of customers and sales, causing our product sales, financial condition, and operating results to be adversely affected and the reporting of our financial results to be delayed.\nIn addition, if we are unable to prevent security breaches or disclosure of non-public information, we may suffer financial and reputational damage, litigation or remediation costs or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our partners, customers, consumers, or suppliers.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry, and some of our competitors and potential competitors have greater resources than we do.\nOur products are sold in highly competitive markets throughout the world. We compete with several large national and international companies that offer a broad range of equipment and replacement parts that compete with our products, as well as with numerous small, privately-held manufacturers and suppliers of a limited number of products mainly on a regional basis. Some of our competitors are significantly larger than we are and have substantially greater financial and other resources at their disposal. We believe that we are able to compete successfully in our markets by, to some extent, avoiding direct competition with significantly larger potential competitors. There can be no assurance that our competitors will not substantially increase the resources devoted to the development and marketing of products competitive with our products or that new competitors with greater resources will not enter our markets. Any failure to effectively compete could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe operate and source internationally, which exposes us to the political, economic and other risks of doing business abroad.\nWe have operations in a number of countries outside of the United States and we source raw materials and components globally. Our international operations are subject to the risks normally associated with conducting business in foreign countries, including but not limited to the following:\n\u2022\nlimitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022\nimport and export restrictions, tariffs and quotas;\n\u2022\nadditional expenses relating to the difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations;\n\u2022\nlabor disputes and uncertain political and economic environments and the impact of foreign business cycles;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or policies;\n\u2022\ndelays in obtaining or the inability to obtain necessary governmental permits;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse consequences resulting from the applicability of foreign tax laws;\n\u2022\ncultural differences;\n\u2022\nincreased expenses due to inflation;\n\u2022\nweak economic conditions in foreign markets where our subsidiaries distribute their products;\n\u2022\nchanges in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in transportation and port authorities; and\n\u2022\nregulations involving international freight shipments.\nOur international operations may also be adversely affected by laws and policies of the United States and the other countries in which we operate affecting foreign trade, investment and taxation.\nIn addition, political developments and governmental regulations and policies in the countries in which we operate directly affect the demand for our products. For example, decreases or delays in farm subsidies to our agricultural customers, or changes in environmental policies aimed at limiting mowing activities, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur acquisition strategy may not be successful, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe intend to grow internally and through the acquisition of businesses and assets that will complement our current businesses. To date, a material portion of our growth has come through acquisitions. We cannot be certain that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition targets, obtain financing for acquisitions on satisfactory terms or successfully acquire identified targets. Competition for acquisition opportunities may also increase our costs of making acquisitions or prevent us from making certain acquisitions. These and other acquisition-related factors may adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be unable to complete or integrate existing or future acquisitions effectively, and businesses we have acquired, or may acquire in the future, may not perform as expected.\nWe may not be successful in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations and achieving projected synergies. We could face many risks in integrating acquired businesses, including but not limited to the following:\n\u2022\nwe may incur substantial costs, delays or other operational or financial challenges in integrating acquired businesses, including integrating each company's accounting, information technology, human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective management;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to achieve expected cost reductions, to take advantage of cross-selling opportunities, or to eliminate redundant operations, facilities and systems;\n\u2022\nwe may need to implement or improve controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a public company;\n\u2022\nacquisitions may divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our existing businesses;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to retain key personnel of acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nthere may be cultural challenges associated with integrating management and employees from the acquired businesses into our organization; and\n\u2022\nwe may encounter unanticipated events, circumstances or legal liabilities.\nOur integration of acquired businesses requires significant efforts from the management of each entity, including coordinating existing business plans and research and development efforts. Integrating operations may distract management\u2019s attention from the day-to-day operation of the combined companies. Ultimately, our attempts to integrate the operations, technology and personnel of acquired businesses may not be successful. If we are unable to successfully integrate acquired businesses, our future results may be negatively impacted.\nIn addition, we may be adversely affected if businesses that we have acquired, or that we acquire in the future, do not perform as expected. An acquired business could perform below our expectations for a number of reasons, including legislative or regulatory changes that affect the areas in which the acquired business specializes, the loss of customers and dealers, general economic factors that directly affect the acquired business, and the cultural incompatibility of its management team. Any or all of these reasons could adversely affect our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nThe agricultural industry and the infrastructure maintenance industry are seasonal and are affected by the weather, and seasonal fluctuations may cause our results of operations and working capital to fluctuate from quarter to quarter.\nIn general, agricultural and governmental end-users typically purchase new equipment during the first and second calendar quarters. Other products such as street sweepers, excavators, snow blowers, front-end loaders and pothole patchers have different seasonal patterns, as do replacement parts in general. In attempting to achieve efficient utilization of manpower and facilities throughout the year, we estimate seasonal demand months in advance and manufacturing capacity is scheduled in anticipation of such demand. We utilize an annual plan with updated quarterly sales forecasts provided by our marketing divisions and order backlog in order to develop a production plan for our manufacturing facilities. In addition, many of our marketing departments attempt to equalize demand for their products throughout the calendar year by offering seasonal sales programs which may provide additional incentives, including discounts and extended payment terms, on equipment that is ordered during off-season periods. Because we spread our production and wholesale shipments throughout the year to take into account the factors described above, sales in any given period may not reflect the timing of dealer orders and retail demand.\nWeather conditions and general economic conditions may affect the timing of purchases and actual industry conditions might differ from our forecasts. Consequently, sudden or significant declines in industry demand could adversely affect our working capital or results of operations.\nIf we do not retain key personnel and attract and retain other highly skilled employees, our business may suffer.\nOur continued success will depend on, among other things, the efforts and skills of our executive officers, including our president and chief executive officer, and our ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified managerial, technical, manufacturing, and sales and marketing personnel. We do not maintain \u201ckey man\u201d life insurance for any of our employees, and all of our senior management are employed at will. We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and hire suitable replacements for any of our key employees. We believe the loss of a key executive officer or other key employee could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to realize the potential or strategic benefits of the acquisitions we complete, or we may not be able to successfully address problems encountered in connection with acquisitions.\nAcquisitions are an important part of our growth strategy. We have completed a number of acquisitions over the past several years. We recently consummated three acquisitions in 2014; our acquisition of Fieldquip in Australia in April 2014; our acquisition of Kellands in the U.K., also in April 2014; and our acquisition of Specialized Industries in the U.S. in May 2014. We expect to consider opportunities and make additional acquisitions in the future, but we may not find suitable acquisition targets or be able to consummate desired acquisitions due to among other things, unfavorable credit markets or other risks, which could harm our operating results. Acquisitions can be difficult, time-consuming, and pose a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\npotential negative impact on our earnings per share;\n\u2022\nfailure of acquired products to achieve projected sales;\n\u2022\nproblems in integrating the acquired products with our products;\n\u2022\npotential downward pressure on operating margins due to lower operating margins of acquired businesses,\n\u2022\nincreased headcount costs and other expenses associated with adding and supporting new products;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in retaining and integrating key employees;\n\u2022\nfailure to realize expected synergies or cost savings;\n\u2022\ndisruption of ongoing business operations, including diversion of management\u2019s attention and uncertainty for employees and customers, particularly during the post-acquisition integration process; and\n\u2022\npotential negative impact on our relationships with customers, distributors and vendors.\nIf we do not manage these risks, the acquisitions that we complete may have an adverse effect on our business, our results of operations, or financial condition.\nIncreasingly stringent engine emission regulations could impact our ability to sell certain of our products into the market and appropriately price certain of our products, which could negatively affect our competitive position and financial results.\nThe EPA has adopted increasingly stringent engine emission regulations, including Tier 4 emission requirements applicable to diesel engines in specified horsepower ranges that are used in some of our products. Beginning January 1, 2013, such requirements expanded to additional horsepower categories and, accordingly, apply to more of our products. Although we have developed plans to achieve substantial compliance with Tier 4 diesel engine emission requirements, these plans are subject to many variables including, among others, the ability of our suppliers to provide compliant and suitable engines on a timely basis and our ability to meet our production schedule. If we are unable to successfully execute such plans, our ability to sell our products into the market may be inhibited, which could adversely affect our competitive position and financial results. To the extent to which we are unable to implement price increases to fully or partially offset higher engine costs as well as related research, development, engineering, and other expenses to design Tier 4 diesel engine compliant products, and our competitors may implement different strategies with respect to compliance with Tier 4 diesel engine emission requirements, we may experience lower market demand for our products that may, ultimately, adversely affect our profit margins, net sales, and overall financial results. In addition, as customers' buying patterns change to purchase our products in advance of price increases on compliant products, we have experienced and may continue to experience abnormal fluctuation in sales and our financial results of any one period may not be representative of expected financial results in subsequent periods. If our competitors implement different strategies with respect to compliance with Tier 4 requirements that, either in the short term or over the long term, enable them to limit price increases, introduce product modifications that gain widespread market acceptance, or otherwise change customer preferences and buying patterns in ways that we do not currently anticipate, we may experience\nlower market demand for our products that may, ultimately, adversely affect our net sales, profit margins, and overall financial results.\nWe are subject on an ongoing basis to the risk of product liability claims and other litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.\nLike other manufacturers, we are subject to various claims, including product liability claims, arising in the ordinary course of business, and we are a party to various legal proceedings that constitute routine litigation incidental to our business. We may be exposed to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury, property damage, or both. We cannot assure you that we will not experience any material product liability losses in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to defend the Company against such claims. While we currently have product liability insurance, we cannot assure you that our product liability insurance coverage will be adequate for any liabilities that may ultimately be incurred or that it will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us. A successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance coverage or a requirement to participate in a product recall may have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to environmental, health and safety and employment laws and regulations and related compliance expenditures and liabilities.\nLike other manufacturers, the Company is subject to a broad range of federal, state, local and foreign laws and requirements, including those concerning air emissions, discharges into waterways, and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and waste materials, as well as the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances at the Company\u2019s facilities and offsite disposal locations, workplace safety and equal employment opportunities. These laws and regulations are constantly changing, and it is impossible to predict with accuracy the effect that changes to such laws and regulations may have on the Company in the future. Like other industrial concerns, the Company\u2019s manufacturing operations entail the risk of noncompliance, and there can be no assurance that the Company will not incur material costs or other liabilities as a result thereof.\nThe Company knows that its Indianola, Iowa property is contaminated with chromium which most likely resulted from chrome plating operations which were discontinued before the Company purchased the property. Chlorinated volatile organic compounds have also been detected in water samples on the property, though the source is unknown at this time. The Company voluntarily worked with an environmental consultant and the state of Iowa with respect to these issues and believes it completed its remediation program in June 2006. The work was accomplished within the Company\u2019s environmental liability reserve balance. We requested a \u201cno further action\u201d classification from the state. We received a conditional \u201cno further action\u201d letter in January of 2009. When we demonstrate stable or improving conditions below residential standards for a certain period of time by monitoring existing wells, we will request an unconditional \u201cno further action\u201d letter.\nThe Company knows that Bush Hog\u2019s main manufacturing property in Selma, Alabama was contaminated with chlorinated volatile organic compounds which most likely resulted from painting and cleaning operations during the 1960s and 1970s. The contaminated areas were primarily in the location of underground storage tanks and underneath the former waste storage area. Under the Asset Purchase Agreement, Bush Hog\u2019s prior owner agreed to and has removed the underground storage tanks at its cost and has remediated the identified contamination in accordance with the regulations of the Alabama Department of Environmental Management. An environmental consulting firm was retained by the prior owner to administer the cleanup and monitor the site on an ongoing basis until the remediation program is complete and approved by the applicable authorities.\nCertain properties of the Company contain asbestos that may have to be remediated over time and it could be additional expense to the Company.\nThe Company is subject to various other federal, state, and local laws affecting its business, as well as a variety of regulations relating to such matters as working conditions, equal employment opportunities, and product safety. A variety of state laws regulate the Company\u2019s contractual relationships with its dealers, some of which impose restrictive standards on the relationship between the Company and its dealers, including events of default, grounds for termination, non-renewal of dealer contracts, and equipment repurchase requirements.\nIf we are unable to comply with the terms of our credit arrangements, especially the financial covenants, our credit arrangements could be terminated.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with all of the terms of our credit arrangements, especially the financial covenants. Our ability to comply with such terms depends on the success of our business and our operating results. Various risks, uncertainties, and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with the terms of our credit arrangements. If we were out of compliance with any covenant required by our credit arrangements following any applicable cure periods, the banks could terminate their commitments unless we could negotiate a covenant waiver. The banks could condition such waiver on amendments to the terms of our credit arrangements that may be unfavorable to us, including, a potential increase to the interest rate we currently pay on outstanding debt under our credit arrangements could increase, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial results.\nOur earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies, predominantly in European countries, Canada and Australia, as a result of the sale of our products in international markets. While we do hedge against such fluctuations to an extent (primarily in the U.K. market), we cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively manage these risks. Significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, such as a devaluation of the Euro against the U.S. dollar, could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations or financial condition.\nRisks related to investing in our common stock\nBecause the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly and may be difficult for you to resell our common stock when desired or at attractive prices.\nThe trading price of our common stock has and may continue to fluctuate. The closing prices of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange during 2014 ranged from $60.00 to $38.33 per share, and during 2013 from $60.69 to $33.89 per share. Our stock price may fluctuate in response to the risk factors set forth herein and to a number of events and factors, such as quarterly variations in operating and financial results, litigation, changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts, the operating and stock performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable to us, news reports relating to us or trends in our industry or general economic conditions. The stock price volatility and trading volume may make it difficult for you to resell your shares of our common stock when desired or at attractive prices.\nYou may experience dilution of your ownership interests due to the future issuance of additional shares of our common stock.\nWe may issue shares of our previously authorized and unissued securities which will result in the dilution of the ownership interests of our present stockholders. We are currently authorized to issue 20,000,000 shares of common stock. On December 31, 2014, 11,318,693 shares of our common stock were issued and outstanding, and there were outstanding options and restricted stock awards totaling an additional 445,943 shares of our common stock. We also have additional shares available for grant under our 2005 Incentive Stock Option Plan and our 2009 Equity Incentive Plan. Additional stock option or other compensation plans or amendments to existing plans for employees and directors may be adopted. Issuance of these shares of common stock may dilute the ownership interests of our then existing stockholders. We may also issue additional shares of our common stock in connection with the hiring of personnel, future acquisitions, such as the 1,700,000 shares issued as consideration for the acquisition of Bush Hog in 2009, future private placements of our securities for capital raising purposes, or for other business purposes. This would further dilute the interests of our existing stockholders.\nThere is no assurance that we will continue declaring dividends or have the available cash to make dividend payments.\nOn January 2, 2015, the Board of Directors of the Company increased its quarterly dividend from $.07 per share to $.08 per share. Although we have paid a cash dividend in each quarter since becoming a public company in 1993, there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare dividends or that funds will contnue to be available for this purpose in the future. The declaration and payment of dividends are restricted by the terms of our amended and restated revolving credit agreement, are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors, are not\ncumulative, and will depend upon our profitability, financial condition, capital needs, future prospects, and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.\nProvisions of our corporate documents may have anti-takeover effects that could prevent a change in control.\nProvisions of our charter, bylaws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders. These provisions include supermajority voting requirements, prohibiting the stockholder from calling stockholder meetings, removal of directors for cause only and prohibiting shareholder actions by written consent. Our Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws state that any amendment to certain provisions, including those provisions regarding the removal of directors and limitations on action by written consent discussed above, be approved by the holders of at least two-thirds of our common stock. We are also afforded the protections of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which would prevent us from engaging in a business combination with a person who becomes a 15% or greater shareholder for a period of three years from the date such person acquired such status unless certain board or shareholder approvals were obtained.\nFuture sales, or the possibility of future sales, of a substantial amount of our common stock may depress the price of the shares of our common stock.\nFuture sales, or the availability for sale in the public market, of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future sales of equity securities. If we or our existing stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or if there is a perception that these sales may occur, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nCertain stockholders own a significant amount of our common stock, and their interests may conflict with those of our other stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2014, four investors Henry Crown and Company, Royce & Associates, LLC, Dimensional Fund Advisors LP, and Wellington Management Group, LLP beneficially owned approximately 38% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, the major stockholders combined could be able to significantly influence the direction of the Company, the election of our Board of Directors and the outcome of any other matter requiring stockholder approval, including mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and together with other beneficially owned investors, to prevent or cause a change in control of the Company. Also, pursuant to contractual obligations, Duroc LLC, an affiliate of Bgear LLC and Henry Crown and Company, was entitled to certain rights with respect to the registration of the common stock owned by them under the Securities Act. Pursuant to such registration rights, on March 12, 2012, we filed a registration statement related to the common stock owned by such entities and such registration statement was declared effective by the SEC. The interests of the major stockholders may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders.", "PERMNO": 78950, "SIC": 3523, "TIC": "ALG"}
