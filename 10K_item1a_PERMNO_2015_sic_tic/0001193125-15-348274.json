{"cik": "836157", "company": "LINDSAY CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-10-20", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - Risk Factors\nThe following are certain of the more significant risks that may affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s irrigation revenues are highly dependent on the agricultural industry and weather conditions. The Company\u2019s irrigation revenues are cyclical and highly dependent upon the need for irrigated agricultural crop production which, in turn, depends upon many factors, including total worldwide crop production, the profitability of agricultural crop production, agricultural commodity prices, net farm income, availability of financing for farmers, governmental policies regarding the agricultural sector, water and energy conservation policies, the regularity of rainfall and regional climate change. As farm income decreases, farmers may postpone capital expenditures or seek less expensive irrigation alternatives.\nWeather conditions, particularly leading up to the planting and early growing season, can significantly affect the purchasing decisions of consumers of irrigation equipment. Natural calamities such as regional floods, hurricanes or other storms, and droughts can have significant effects on seasonal irrigation demand. Drought conditions, which generally impact irrigation equipment demand positively over the long term, can adversely affect demand if water sources become unavailable or if governments impose water restriction policies to reduce overall water availability.\nVolatility in global markets with respect to currency exchange rates, commodity prices including market prices for grain and oil, and potential changes in interest rates can adversely affect the Company\u2019s worldwide sales, operating margins and the competitiveness of the Company\u2019s products.\nThe Company conducts operations in a variety of locations around the world, which means that market fluctuations in currencies, commodities and interest rates can affect demand for the Company\u2019s products and the\ncost of production. These factors all impact end customers\u2019 purchase decisions and are therefore interconnected, making it difficult to predict how any single factor might impact customers\u2019 decisions to purchase the Company\u2019s products.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rates. For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015, approximately 37 percent of the Company\u2019s consolidated revenues were generated from international sales and United States export revenue to international regions. Most of the Company\u2019s international sales involve some level of export from the U.S., either of components or completed products. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar and/or the weakening of local currencies can increase the cost of the Company\u2019s products in those foreign markets. The impact of these changes can make these products less competitive relative to local producing competitors and, in extreme cases, can result in the Company\u2019s products not being cost-effective for customers. As a result, the Company\u2019s international sales and profit margins could decline.\nGrain Pricing. Changes in grain prices can impact the return on investment of the Company\u2019s products. Grain prices are influenced by both global and local markets. The primary benefit of many of the Company\u2019s irrigation products is to increase grain yields and the resulting revenue for farmers. As grain prices decline, the breakeven point of incremental production is more difficult to achieve, reducing or eliminating the profit and return on investment from the purchase of the Company\u2019s products. As a result, changes in grain prices can significantly impact the Company\u2019s sales levels in the U.S. and international markets.\nManufacturing Input Costs. Certain of the Company\u2019s input costs, such as the cost of steel, zinc, and other raw materials, may increase rapidly from time to time. Due to price competition in the market for irrigation equipment and certain infrastructure products, the Company may not be able to recoup increases in these costs through price increases for its products, which would result in reduced profitability. Whether increased operating costs can be passed through to the customer depends on a number of factors, including farm income and the price of competing products. The cost of raw materials can be volatile and is dependent on a number of factors, including availability, demand, and freight costs.\nOil Pricing. The decline in oil prices could impact the Company\u2019s irrigation markets, either by negatively affecting the biofuels market or by reducing government revenues of oil producing countries that purchase or subsidize the purchase of irrigation equipment. Biofuels production is a significant source of grain demand in the U.S. and certain international markets. While ethanol production levels are currently mandated within the U.S., potential mandate changes or price declines for ethanol producing companies could reduce the demand for grains. In addition, a number of ethanol producers in the U.S. are cooperatives partially owned by farmers. Reduced profit of ethanol production could reduce income for farmers which could, in turn, reduce the demand for irrigation equipment.\nInterest Rates. Interest rates globally have been at historically low levels. In some international markets we have begun to see these rates rise and it is expected that global rates will continue to increase, potentially very quickly in the U.S., as the economy improves. An increase in interest rates will make it more difficult for end customers to cost-effectively fund the purchase of new equipment, which could reduce the Company\u2019s sales.\nThe Company\u2019s infrastructure revenues are highly dependent on government funding of transportation projects and subject to compliance with government regulations. The demand for the Company\u2019s infrastructure products depends to a large degree on the amount of government spending authorized to improve road and highway systems. For example, the U.S. government funds highway and road improvements through the Federal Highway Trust Fund Program and matching funding from states may be required as a condition of federal funding. Currently funding is provided primarily through a series of temporary highway funding bills that have been passed over the previous several years. Until and unless a long-term U.S. highway bill is passed, uncertainties and limitations on growth could impact the infrastructure business. If highway funding is reduced or delayed, it may reduce demand for the Company\u2019s infrastructure products.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s road safety products are required to meet certain standards as outlined by the various governments worldwide. The Federal Highway Administration (\u201cFHWA\u201d) has recently indicated the intention to\nmandate the Manual for Assessing Safety Hardware (\u201cMASH\u201d) standards subject to approval by states for use in each respective jurisdiction. In addition, state Departments of Transportation (\u201cDOT\u201d) have the ability to require compliance with MASH standards prior to the FHWA mandating such practices. MASH was previously optional and most road safety products in the market have not been approved under this standard. The Company will likely incur R&D and testing expense to comply with these standards. In addition, the adoption of the new standards could impact the Company\u2019s competitive position in the market which could have a significant impact on the sales and profitability from its road safety product line. The timeline for adoption of the MASH standard has not been determined.\nThe Company\u2019s profitability may be negatively affected by the disruption or termination of the supply of parts, materials, and components from third-party suppliers. The Company uses a limited number of suppliers for certain parts, materials, and components in the manufacturing process. Disruptions or delays in supply or significant price increases from these suppliers could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations and profitability. Such disruptions, terminations or cost increases could result in cost inefficiencies, delayed sales or reduced sales.\nThe Company\u2019s international equipment sales are highly dependent on foreign market conditions and are subject to additional risk and restrictions. For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015, approximately 37 percent of the Company\u2019s consolidated revenues were generated from international sales and United States export revenue to international regions. International revenues are primarily generated from Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Central and Western Europe, Mexico, the Middle East, Africa, China, Russia/Ukraine, and Central and South America. In addition to risks relating to general economic and political stability in these countries, the Company\u2019s international sales are affected by international trade barriers, including governmental policies on tariffs, taxes, import or export licensing requirements, trade sanctions, and foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, the collectability of receivables can be difficult to estimate, particularly in areas of political instability or with governments with which the Company has limited experience or where there is a lack of transparency as to the current credit condition. The Company does business in a number of countries that are particularly susceptible to disruption from changing social economic conditions as well as terrorism, political hostilities, sanctions, war and similar incidents.\nCompliance with applicable environmental and health and safety regulations or standards may require additional capital and operational expenditures. Like other manufacturing concerns, the Company is subject to numerous laws and regulations which govern environmental and occupational health and safety matters. The Company believes that its operations are substantially in compliance with all such applicable laws and regulations and that it holds all necessary permits in each jurisdiction in which its facilities are located. Environmental and health and safety regulations are subject to change and interpretation. Compliance with applicable regulations or standards may require the Company to make additional capital and operational expenditures.\nThe Company\u2019s Lindsay, Nebraska site was added to the list of priority superfund sites of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the \u201cEPA\u201d) in 1989. The Company and its environmental consultants have developed a remedial alternative work plan, under which the Company continues to work with the EPA to define and implement steps to better contain and remediate the remaining contamination. Although the Company has accrued all reasonably estimable costs associated with remediation of the site, it is expected that additional testing and environmental monitoring and remediation could be required in the future as part of the Company\u2019s ongoing discussions with the EPA regarding the development and implementation of the remedial action plans. In addition, the current investigation has not yet been completed and does not include all potentially affected areas on the site. Due to the current stage of discussions with the EPA and the uncertainty of the remediation actions that may be required with respect to these affected areas, the Company believes that meaningful estimates of costs or range of costs cannot currently be made and accordingly have not been accrued. The Company\u2019s ongoing remediation activities at its Lindsay, Nebraska facility are described in Note N, Commitments and Contingencies, to the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company\u2019s consolidated financial results are reported in U.S. dollars while certain assets and other reported items are denominated in the currencies of other countries, creating currency translation risk. The reporting currency for the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements is the U.S. dollar. Certain of the Company\u2019s assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are denominated in other countries\u2019 currencies. Those assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates to prepare the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Therefore, increases or decreases in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and those other currencies affect the value of those items as reflected in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Substantial fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to those other currencies could have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s results.\nExpansion of the Company\u2019s business may result in unanticipated adverse consequences. The Company routinely considers possible expansions of the business, both domestically and in foreign locations. Acquisitions, partnerships, joint ventures or other similar major investments require significant managerial resources, which may be diverted from the Company\u2019s other business activities. The risks of any expansion of the business through investments, acquisitions, partnerships or joint ventures are increased due to the significant capital and other resources that the Company may have to commit to any such expansion, which may not be recoverable if the expansion initiative to which they were devoted is not fully implemented or is ultimately unsuccessful. As a result of these risks and other factors, including general economic risk, the Company may not be able to realize projected returns from any recent or future acquisitions, partnerships, joint ventures or other investments.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions to the Company\u2019s information technology infrastructure could interfere with its operations and could compromise the Company\u2019s and its customers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 information, exposing the Company to liability that could cause its business and reputation to suffer. In the ordinary course of business, the Company relies upon information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business functions, including supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and collection of payments. The Company uses information technology systems to record, process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. Additionally, the Company collects and stores sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and the proprietary business information of customers and suppliers, as well as personally identifiable information of customers and employees, in data centers and on information technology networks. The secure operation of these networks and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to the Company\u2019s business operations and strategy. Despite security measures and business continuity plans, the Company\u2019s information technology networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error or malfeasance or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures or natural disasters or other catastrophic events. The occurrence of any of these events could compromise the Company\u2019s networks, and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, disrupt operations, and damage the Company\u2019s reputation, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.", "PERMNO": 12211, "SIC": 3523, "TIC": "LNN"}
