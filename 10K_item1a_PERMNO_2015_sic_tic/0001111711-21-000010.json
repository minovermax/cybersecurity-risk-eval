RISK FACTORS\nNISOURCE INC.\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock.\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\nWe may not be able to execute our business plan or growth strategy, including utility infrastructure investments.\nBusiness or regulatory conditions may result in us not being able to execute our business plan or growth strategy, including identified, planned and other utility infrastructure investments, which includes investments related to natural gas pipeline modernization and investments related to our renewable energy projects and the build-transfer execution goals within our business plan. Our \u201cNiSource Next\u201d initiative, a comprehensive program designed to identify long-term sustainable capability enhancements and cost optimization improvements, may not be effective. Our customer and regulatory initiatives may not achieve planned results. Utility infrastructure investments may not materialize, may cease to be achievable or economically viable and may not be successfully completed. Natural gas may cease to be viewed as an economically and environmentally attractive fuel. Environmental activist groups, investors and governmental entities may continue to oppose natural gas delivery and infrastructure investments in the jurisdictions where we operate because of perceived environmental impacts associated with the natural gas supply chain and end use. Energy conservation, energy efficiency, distributed generation, energy storage, policies favoring electric heat over gas heat and other factors may reduce demand for natural gas and energy. In addition, we consider acquisitions or dispositions of assets or businesses, joint ventures and mergers from time to time as we execute on our business plan and growth strategy. Any of these circumstances could adversely affect our results of operations and growth prospects. Even if our business plan and growth strategy are executed, there is still risk of, among other things, human error in maintenance, installation or operations, shortages or delays in obtaining equipment, and performance below expected levels (in addition to the other risks discussed in this section).\nOur gas distribution and transmission activities, as well as generation, transmission and distribution of electricity, involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks, including potential public safety risks.\nOur gas distribution and transmission activities, as well as generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity, involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks, including, but not limited to, gas leaks and over-pressurization, downed power lines, excavation or vehicular damage to our infrastructure, outages, environmental spills, mechanical problems and other incidents, which could cause substantial financial losses, as demonstrated in part by the Greater Lawrence Incident. In addition, these hazards and risks have resulted and may in the future result in serious injury or loss of life to employees and/or the general public, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations, adverse regulatory rulings and reputational harm, which in turn could lead to substantial losses for us. The location of pipeline facilities, including regulator stations, liquefied natural gas and underground storage, or generation, transmission, substation and distribution facilities near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from such incidents. As with the Greater Lawrence Incident, certain incidents have subjected and may in the future subject us to litigation or administrative or other legal proceedings from time to time, both civil and criminal, which could result in substantial monetary judgments, fines, or penalties against us, be resolved on unfavorable terms, and require us to incur significant operational expenses. The occurrence of incidents has in certain instances adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect our reputation, cash flows, financial position and/or results of operations. We maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses.\nFailure to adapt to advances in technology and manage the related costs could make us less competitive and negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nA key element of our business model includes generating power at central station power plants to achieve economies of scale and produce power at a competitive cost. We continue to research, plan for, and implement new technologies that produce reliable, cost-efficient power or reduce power consumption. These technologies include renewable energy, distributed generation, energy storage, and energy efficiency. Advances in technology, changes in laws or regulations (including subsidization) and other alternative methods of producing power are reducing the cost of electric generation from these sources to a level that is competitive with most central station power electric production. This could cause power sales to decline and the value of our generating facilities to decline. New technologies may require us to make significant expenditures to remain competitive and may result in the obsolescence of certain operating assets.\nOur natural gas business model leverages widespread utilization of natural gas for space heating as a core driver of revenues. Alternative energy sources, new technologies or alternatives to natural gas space heating, including cold climate heat pumps and/or efficiency of other products, could reduce demand and increase customer attrition, which would impact our ability to recover on our investments in our gas distribution assets.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nNISOURCE INC.\nIn addition, customers are increasingly expecting additional communications, increased access to information, and expanded electronic capabilities regarding their electric and natural gas services, which, in some cases, involves additional investments in technology. We also rely on technology to adequately maintain key business records.\nOur future success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and successfully adapt to technological changes, to offer services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards, and to recover all, or a significant portion of, any unrecovered investment in obsolete assets. A failure by us to effectively adapt to changes in technology and manage the related costs could harm our ability to remain competitive in the marketplace for our products, services and processes and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAging infrastructure may lead to disruptions in operations and increased capital expenditures and maintenance costs, all of which could negatively impact our financial results.\nWe have risks associated with aging infrastructure, including our electric and gas infrastructure assets. These risks can be driven by threats such as, but not limited to, electrical faults, mechanical failure, internal corrosion, external corrosion, ground movement and stress corrosion and/or cracking. The age of these assets may result in a need for replacement, a higher level of maintenance costs, or unscheduled outages, despite efforts by us to properly maintain or upgrade these assets through inspection, scheduled maintenance and capital investment. In addition, the nature of the information available on aging infrastructure assets, which in some cases is incomplete, may make inspections, maintenance, upgrading and replacement of the assets particularly challenging. Missing or incorrect infrastructure data may lead to (1) difficulty properly locating facilities, which can result in excavator damage and operational or emergency response issues, and (2) configuration and control risks associated with the modification of system operating pressures in connection with turning off or turning on service to customers, which can result in unintended outages or operating pressures. Also, additional maintenance and inspections are required in some instances in order to improve infrastructure information and records and address emerging regulatory or risk management requirements, which increases our costs. The failure to operate these assets as desired could result in interruption of electric service, major component failure at generating facilities and electric substations, gas leaks and other incidents and in our inability to meet firm service obligations, which could adversely impact revenues, and could also result in increased capital expenditures and maintenance costs, which, if not fully recovered from customers, could negatively impact our financial results.\nWe may be unable to obtain insurance on acceptable terms or at all, and the insurance coverage we do obtain may not provide protection against all significant losses.\nOur ability to obtain insurance, as well as the cost and coverage of such insurance, are affected by developments affecting our business; international, national, state, or local events; and the financial condition and underwriting considerations of insurers. For example, some insurers are moving away from underwriting certain energy related businesses such as those in the coal industry or those exposed to certain perils such as wildfires as well as gas explosion events or other infrastructure-related risks. The utility insurance market is experiencing a hardening environment due to reductions in commercial suppliers and the capacity they are willing to issue, increases in overall demand for capacity, and a prevalence of severe losses. We have not been able to obtain liability insurance coverage at previously procured limits at rates that are acceptable to us. Insurance coverage may not continue to be available at limits, rates or terms acceptable to us. The premiums we pay for our insurance coverage have significantly increased as a result of market conditions and the accumulated loss ratio over the history of our operations, and we expect that they will continue to increase as a result of hardening in market conditions. In addition, our insurance is not sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which we are subject. For example, total expenses related to the Greater Lawrence Incident exceeded the total amount of liability coverage available under our policies. Certain types of damages, expenses or claimed costs, such as fines and penalties, have been and in the future may be excluded under the policies. In addition, insurers providing insurance to us may raise defenses to coverage under the terms and conditions of the respective insurance policies that could result in a denial of coverage or limit the amount of insurance proceeds available to us. Any losses for which we are not fully insured or that are not covered by insurance at all could materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and financial position.\nThe implementation of NIPSCO\u2019s electric generation strategy, including the retirement of its coal generation units, may not achieve intended results.\nOur plan to replace 80% of our coal generation capacity by mid-2023 and all of our coal generation by the end of 2028 with primarily renewable resources may not progress as anticipated. On October 31, 2018, NIPSCO submitted its 2018 Integrated Resource Plan with the IURC setting forth its short- and long-term electric generation plans in an effort to maintain affordability while providing reliable, flexible and cleaner sources of power. The Integrated Resource Plan evaluated demand-side and supply-side resource alternatives to meet NIPSCO customers' future energy requirements over the ensuing 20 years.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nNISOURCE INC.\nThe preferred option within the Integrated Resource Plan retires the R.M. Schahfer Generating Station by mid-2023 and the Michigan City Generating Station by the end of 2028. These stations represent 2,080 MW of generating capacity, equal to 72% of NIPSCO\u2019s remaining generating capacity and 100% of NIPSCO's remaining coal-fired generating capacity. The current replacement plan includes renewable sources of energy, including wind, solar, and battery storage. In the second quarter of 2020, the MISO approved NIPSCO's plan to retire the R.M. Schahfer Generating Station in 2023. In February 2021, NIPSCO decided to submit modified Attachment Y Notices to MISO requesting accelerated retirement of two of the four units at R.M. Schahfer Generating Station. The two units are now expected to be retired by the end of 2021, with the remaining two units still scheduled to be retired in 2023. Refer to Note 20- E. \"Other Matters - NIPSCO 2018 Integrated Resource Plan,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nThere are inherent risks and uncertainties in executing the Integrated Resource Plan, including changes in market conditions, regulatory approvals, environmental regulations, commodity costs and customer expectations, which may impede NIPSCO\u2019s ability to achieve the intended results. NIPSCO\u2019s future success will depend, in part, on its ability to successfully implement its long-term electric generation plans, to offer services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards, and to recover all, or a significant portion of, any unrecovered investment in obsolete assets. NIPSCO\u2019s electric generation strategy could require significant future capital expenditures, operating costs and charges to earnings that may negatively impact our financial position, financial results and cash flows. As required by statute, NIPSCO plans to submit a new Integrated Resource Plan to the IURC by November 1, 2021. This submission will again outline NIPSCO's short and long term plans for meeting the energy supply needs of its customers, taking into account current perspectives on a range of factors including, but not limited to, new state and federal policy, wholesale market rules, forecasted customer demand, and available resource alternatives.The analysis, conclusions and Preferred Plan in the 2021 Integrated Resource Plan may be different from the analysis, conclusions and Preferred Plan in the 2018 Integrated Resource Plan.\nOur capital projects and programs subject us to construction risks and natural gas costs and supply risks, and are subject to regulatory oversight, including requirements for permits, approvals and certificates from various governmental agencies.\nOur business requires substantial capital expenditures for investments in, among other things, capital improvements to our electric generating facilities, electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure, natural gas storage, and other projects, including projects for environmental compliance. We are engaged in intrastate natural gas pipeline modernization programs to maintain system integrity and enhance service reliability and flexibility. NIPSCO also is currently engaged in a number of capital projects, including environmental improvements to its electric generating stations, the construction of new transmission facilities, and new projects related to renewable energy. As we undertake these projects and programs, we may be unable to complete them on schedule or at the anticipated costs. Additionally, we may construct or purchase some of these projects and programs to capture anticipated future growth in natural gas production, which may not materialize, and may cause the construction to occur over an extended period of time.\nOur existing and planned capital projects require numerous permits, approvals and certificates from federal, state, and local governmental agencies. If there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals or if we fail to obtain or maintain any required approvals or to comply with any applicable laws or regulations, we may not be able to construct or operate our facilities, we may be forced to incur additional costs, or we may be unable to recover any or all amounts invested in a project. We also may not receive the anticipated increases in revenue and cash flows resulting from such projects and programs until after their completion. Other construction risks include changes in costs of materials, equipment, commodities or labor (including changes to tariffs on materials), delays caused by construction incidents or injuries, work stoppages, shortages in qualified labor, poor initial cost estimates, unforeseen engineering issues, the ability to obtain necessary rights-of-way, easements and transmissions connections and general contractors and subcontractors not performing as required under their contracts.\nOn May 1, 2020, former President Donald Trump issued an executive order (the \u201cEO\u201d) prohibiting any transaction initiated after that day that (i) involves bulk-power system (\u201cBPS\u201d) equipment designed, developed, manufactured or supplied by persons owned by, controlled by or subject to the jurisdiction or direction of a foreign adversary and (ii) poses an unacceptable risk to national security. Implementing regulations from the U.S. Secretary of Energy are still pending. The EO also requires the U.S. Secretary of Energy to review the risk of existing bulk-power system equipment sourced from foreign adversaries and to establish a task force to review and recommend federal procurement policies and procedures consistent with the considerations identified in the EO. On July 8, 2020, the U.S. Department of Energy issued a Request for Information (\u201cRFI\u201d), seeking input from industry stakeholders to \u201cunderstand the energy industry\u2019s current practices to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in the supply chain\u201d for components of bulk-power system equipment. The RFI identifies the following governments as \u201cforeign adversaries\u201d: China, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Russia and Venezuela. The RFI notes that the U.S. Secretary of Energy retains\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nNISOURCE INC.\nauthority to amend this list at any time and such countries have been identified only for the purposes of the EO. Pursuant to the EO, on December 17, 2020, the U.S. Department of Energy issued a Prohibition Order (the \u201cProhibition Order\u201d) prohibiting the acquisition, importation, transfer, or installment of specified BPS equipment from China that directly serves critical defense facilities. While the implications of the Prohibition Order are still being assessed, it could impact our procurement processes for BPS equipment. In the future, certain bulk-power system equipment owned or operated by NiSource could possibly be considered to be sourced from a foreign adversary within the meaning of the EO. These regulations, if implemented, may impact our procurement processes for bulk-power system equipment.\nTo the extent that delays occur, costs become unrecoverable, or we otherwise become unable to effectively manage and complete our capital projects, our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nA significant portion of the gas and electricity we sell is used by residential and commercial customers for heating and air conditioning. Accordingly, fluctuations in weather, gas and electricity commodity costs and economic conditions impact demand of our customers and our operating results.\nEnergy sales are sensitive to variations in weather. Forecasts of energy sales are based on \u201cnormal\u201d weather, which represents a long-term historical average. Significant variations from normal weather, could have, and have had, a material impact on energy sales. Additionally, residential usage, and to some degree commercial usage, is sensitive to fluctuations in commodity costs for gas and electricity, whereby usage declines with increased costs, thus affecting our financial results. Lastly, residential and commercial customers\u2019 usage is sensitive to economic conditions and factors such as unemployment, consumption and consumer confidence. Therefore, prevailing economic conditions affecting the demand of our customers may in turn affect our financial results.\nFluctuations in the price of energy commodities or their related transportation costs or an inability to obtain an adequate, reliable and cost-effective fuel supply to meet customer demands may have a negative impact on our financial results.\nOur current electric generating fleet is dependent on coal and natural gas for fuel, and our gas distribution operations purchase and resell a portion of the natural gas we deliver to our customers. These energy commodities are subject to price fluctuations and fluctuations in associated transportation costs. When appropriate, we use hedging in order to offset fluctuations in commodity supply prices. We rely on regulatory recovery mechanisms in the various jurisdictions in order to fully recover the commodity costs incurred in selling energy to our customers. However, while we have historically been successful in the recovery of costs related to such commodity prices, there can be no assurance that such costs will be fully recovered through rates in a timely manner.\nIn addition, we depend on electric transmission lines, natural gas pipelines, and other transportation facilities owned and operated by third parties to deliver the electricity and natural gas we sell to wholesale markets, supply natural gas to our gas storage and electric generation facilities, and provide retail energy services to customers. If transportation is disrupted, or if capacity is inadequate, we may be unable to sell and deliver our gas and electric services to some or all of our customers. As a result, we may be required to procure additional or alternative electricity and/or natural gas supplies at then-current market rates, which, if recovery of related costs is disallowed, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and/or prospects.\nFailure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, and maintain good labor relations, could harm our results of operations.\nWe operate in an industry that requires many of our employees to possess unique technical skill sets. Events such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, the mismatch of skill sets to future needs, or the unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges or increased costs. These operating challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge, and a lengthy time period associated with skill development. In addition, current and prospective employees may determine that they do not wish to work for us due to market, economic, employment and other conditions. Failure to hire and retain qualified employees, including the ability to transfer significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, may adversely affect our ability to manage and operate our business. If we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, safety, service reliability, customer satisfaction and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nSome of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Our collective bargaining agreements are generally negotiated on an operating company basis. Any failure to reach an agreement on new labor contracts or to negotiate these labor contracts might result in strikes, boycotts or other labor disruptions. Labor disruptions, strikes or significant negotiated wage\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nNISOURCE INC.\nand benefit increases, whether due to union activities, employee turnover or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nIf we cannot effectively manage new initiatives and organizational changes, we will be unable to address the opportunities and challenges presented by our strategy and the business and regulatory environment.\nIn order to execute on our sustainable growth strategy and enhance our culture of ongoing continuous improvement, we must effectively manage the complexity and frequency of new initiatives and organizational changes. If we are unable to make decisions quickly, assess our opportunities and risks, and implement new governance, managerial and organizational processes as needed to execute our strategy in this increasingly dynamic and competitive business and regulatory environment, our financial condition, results of operations and relationships with our business partners, regulators, customers and stockholders may be negatively impacted.\nWe outsource certain business functions to third-party suppliers and service providers, and substandard performance by those third parties could harm our business, reputation and results of operations.\nUtilities rely on extensive networks of business partners and suppliers to support critical enterprise capabilities across their organizations. Global metrics indicate that deliveries from suppliers are slowing and that labor shortages are occurring in the energy sector. We outsource certain services to third parties in areas including construction services, information technology, materials, fleet, environmental, operational services and other areas. Outsourcing of services to third parties could expose us to inferior service quality or substandard deliverables, which may result in non-compliance (including with applicable legal requirements and industry standards), interruption of service or accidents, or reputational harm, which could negatively impact our results of operations. If any difficulties in the operations of these third-party suppliers and service providers, including their systems, were to occur, they could adversely affect our results of operations, or adversely affect our ability to work with regulators, unions, customers or employees.\nA cyber-attack on any of our or certain third-party computer systems upon which we rely may adversely affect our ability to operate and could lead to a loss or misuse of confidential and proprietary information or potential liability.\nWe are reliant on technology to run our business, which is dependent upon financial and operational computer systems to process critical information necessary to conduct various elements of our business, including the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity; operation of our gas pipeline facilities; and the recording and reporting of commercial and financial transactions to regulators, investors and other stakeholders. In addition to general information and cyber risks that all large corporations face (e.g., malware, unauthorized access attempts, phishing attacks, malicious intent by insiders, third-party software vulnerabilities and inadvertent disclosure of sensitive information), the utility industry faces evolving and increasingly complex cybersecurity risks associated with protecting sensitive and confidential customer and employee information, electric grid infrastructure, and natural gas infrastructure. Deployment of new business technologies, along with maintaining legacy technology, represents a large-scale opportunity for attacks on our information systems and confidential customer and employee information, as well as on the integrity of the energy grid and the natural gas infrastructure. Increasing large-scale corporate attacks in conjunction with more sophisticated threats continue to challenge power and utility companies. Any failure of our computer systems, or those of our customers, suppliers or others with whom we do business, could materially disrupt our ability to operate our business and could result in a financial loss and possibly do harm to our reputation.\nAdditionally, our information systems experience ongoing, often sophisticated, cyber-attacks by a variety of sources, including foreign sources, with the apparent aim to breach our cyber-defenses. Although we attempt to maintain adequate defenses to these attacks and work through industry groups and trade associations to identify common threats and assess our countermeasures, a security breach of our information systems, or a security breach of the information systems of our customers, suppliers or others with whom we do business, could (i) impact the reliability of our generation, transmission and distribution systems and potentially negatively impact our compliance with certain mandatory reliability standards, (ii) subject us to reputational and other harm or liabilities associated with theft or inappropriate release of certain types of information such as system operating information or information, personal or otherwise, relating to our customers or employees, (iii) impact our ability to manage our businesses, and/or (iv) subject us to legal and regulatory proceedings and claims from third parties, in addition to remediation costs, any of which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects. Although we do maintain cyber insurance, it is possible that such insurance will not adequately cover any losses or liabilities we may incur as a result of a cybersecurity incident.\nWe are exposed to significant reputational risks, which make us vulnerable to a loss of cost recovery, increased litigation and negative public perception.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nNISOURCE INC.\nAs a utility company, we are subject to adverse publicity focused on the reliability of our services, the speed with which we are able to respond effectively to electric outages, natural gas leaks or events and related accidents and similar interruptions caused by storm damage or other unanticipated events, as well as our own or third parties' actions or failure to act. We are also subject to adverse publicity related to actual or perceived environmental impacts. If customers, legislators, or regulators have or develop a negative opinion of us, this could result in less favorable legislative and regulatory outcomes or increased regulatory oversight, increased litigation and negative public perception. The adverse publicity and investigations we experienced as a result of the Greater Lawrence Incident may have an ongoing negative impact on the public\u2019s perception of us. It is difficult to predict the ultimate impact of this adverse publicity. The foregoing may have continuing adverse effects on our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nThe sale of the Massachusetts Business poses risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business, and we may not realize the expected benefits of the sale of the Massachusetts Business.\nOn October 9, 2020, we completed the sale of the Massachusetts Business to Eversource. The sale of the Massachusetts Business involves separation or carve-out activities and costs and possible disputes with Eversource. We have continued financial liabilities with respect to the business conducted by Columbia of Massachusetts, as we retain responsibility for, and have agreed to indemnify Eversource against, certain liabilities. This responsibility includes liabilities for any fines arising out of the Greater Lawrence Incident and liabilities of Columbia of Massachusetts or its affiliates pursuant to civil claims for injury of persons or damage to property to the extent such injury or damage occurred prior to the closing in connection with the Massachusetts Business. It may also be difficult to determine whether a claim from a third party is our responsibility, and we may expend substantial resources trying to determine whether we or Eversource has responsibility for the claim.\nFurther, the sale of the Massachusetts Business may result in a dilutive impact to our future earnings if we are unable to offset the loss of revenue associated with the sale, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe impacts of natural disasters, acts of terrorism, acts of war, civil unrest, cyber-attacks, accidents, public health emergencies or other catastrophic events may disrupt operations and reduce the ability to service customers.\nA disruption or failure of natural gas distribution systems, or within electric generation, transmission or distribution systems, in the event of a major hurricane, tornado, terrorist attack, acts of war, civil unrest, cyber-attack (as further detailed above), accident, public health emergency, pandemic, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing other critical functions. We have experienced disruptions in the past from hurricanes and tornadoes and other events of this nature. Also, companies in our industry face a heightened risk of exposure to acts of terrorism and vandalism. The occurrence of such events could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. In accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses.\nClimate change has the potential to affect our business.\nOur strategy may be impacted by policy and legal, technology, market, and reputational risks and opportunities that are associated with the transition to a lower-carbon economy, as disclosed in other risk factors in this section. In addition, climate change may exacerbate the risks to our physical infrastructure, including heat stresses to power lines, storms that damage infrastructure, lake and sea level changes that affect the manner in which services are currently provided, droughts or other stresses on water used to supply services, and other extreme weather conditions. Climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy have the potential to affect our business by reducing our ability to serve customers, increasing the costs we incur in providing our products and services, impacting the demand for and consumption of our products and services (due to changes in costs, technology, reputation and weather patterns), and affecting the economic health of the regions in which we operate. Changes in policy to combat climate change, and technology advancement, each of which can also accelerate the implications of a transition to a lower carbon economy, may materially adversely impact our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nExtreme weather conditions may negatively impact our operations.\nWe conduct our operations across a wide geographic area subject to varied and potentially extreme weather conditions, which may from time to time persist for sustained periods of time. Despite preventative maintenance efforts, persistent weather related stress on our infrastructure may reveal weaknesses in our systems not previously known to us or otherwise present various operational challenges across all business segments. Further, adverse weather may affect our ability to conduct operations in a manner that satisfies customer expectations or contractual obligations, including by causing service disruptions.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nNISOURCE INC.\nFINANCIAL, ECONOMIC AND MARKET RISKS\nWe have substantial indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial condition.\nOur business is capital intensive and we rely significantly on long-term debt to fund a portion of our capital expenditures and repay outstanding debt, and on short-term borrowings to fund a portion of day-to-day business operations. We had total consolidated indebtedness of $9,746.1 million outstanding as of December 31, 2020. Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022limit our ability to borrow additional funds or increase the cost of borrowing additional funds;\n\u2022reduce the availability of cash flow from operations to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the business and the industries in which we operate;\n\u2022lead parties with whom we do business to require additional credit support, such as letters of credit, in order for us to transact such business;\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that are less leveraged;\n\u2022increase vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and\n\u2022limit our ability to execute on our growth strategy, which is dependent upon access to capital to fund our substantial infrastructure investment program.\nSome of our debt obligations contain financial covenants related to debt-to-capital ratios and cross-default provisions. Our failure to comply with any of these covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of outstanding debt obligations.\nA drop in our credit ratings could adversely impact our cash flows, results of operation, financial condition and liquidity.\nThe availability and cost of credit for our businesses may be greatly affected by credit ratings. The credit rating agencies periodically review our ratings, taking into account factors such as our capital structure, earnings profile, and, in 2020 and 2021, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. We are committed to maintaining investment grade credit ratings; however, there is no assurance we will be able to do so in the future. Our credit ratings could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, the circumstances warrant. Any negative rating action could adversely affect our ability to access capital at rates and on terms that are attractive. A negative rating action could also adversely impact our business relationships with suppliers and operating partners, who may be less willing to extend credit or offer us similarly favorable terms as secured in the past under such circumstances.\nCertain of our subsidiaries have agreements that contain \u201cratings triggers\u201d that require increased collateral in the form of cash, a letter of credit or other forms of security for new and existing transactions if our credit ratings (including the standalone credit ratings of certain of our subsidiaries) are dropped below investment grade. These agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of gas or power. As of December 31, 2020, the collateral requirement that would be required in the event of a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $53.9 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain \u201cadequate assurance\u201d or \u201cmaterial adverse change\u201d provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business.\nIf our or certain of our subsidiaries' credit ratings were downgraded, especially below investment grade, financing costs and the principal amount of borrowings would likely increase due to the additional risk of our debt and because certain counterparties may require additional credit support as described above. Such amounts may be material and could adversely affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. Losing investment grade credit ratings may also result in more restrictive covenants and reduced flexibility on repayment terms in debt issuances, lower share price and greater stockholder dilution from common equity issuances, in addition to reputational damage within the investment community.\nThe novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic adversely impacts our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nNISOURCE INC.\nThe continued spread of COVID-19 has resulted in widespread impacts on the global economy and financial markets and could lead to a prolonged reduction in economic activity, extended disruptions to supply chains and capital markets, and reduced labor availability and productivity. We have experienced lower revenues, higher expenses for personal protective equipment and supplies, and higher bad debt expense as a consequence of the pandemic, which has negatively impacted our results of operations as of December 31, 2020. Our future operating results and liquidity may continue to be impacted by the pandemic, but the extent of the impact remains uncertain. Such ongoing impact of the pandemic includes, but is not limited to:\n\u2022Lower revenue and cash flow, resulting from the decrease in commercial and industrial gas and electric demand as businesses comply with operating restrictions and re-opening plans in each state and as businesses experience negative economic impact from the pandemic, potentially offset by higher residential demand;\n\u2022Lower revenue and cash flow due to the continuing suspension of late payment and reconnection fees in some jurisdictions;\n\u2022A decline in revenue due to an increase in customer attrition rates, as well as lower revenue growth if customer additions slow due to a prolonged economic downturn;\n\u2022A continued increase in bad debt and a decrease in cash flows resulting from the suspension of shut-offs and the inability of our customers to pay for their gas and electric service due to job loss or other factors, partially offset by regulatory deferral;\n\u2022Lower revenues on a prolonged basis resulting from higher customer bankruptcies, predominately focused on commercial and industrial customers not able to sustain operations through the broader economic downturn;\n\u2022A continued delay in cash flows as customers utilize the more flexible payment plans we offer; and\n\u2022An increase in internal labor costs from higher overtime.\nWe also face the risk of not achieving operational compliance and/or customer requirements because of work restrictions or unavailable employees due to the pandemic. For more information regarding the items above and additional items related to the pandemic that we are evaluating and monitoring, please see our discussion of these topics in Part II., Item 7. \"Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Executive Summary - Introduction - COVID-19\" in this report and in our future filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. To the extent the pandemic adversely affects our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity or cash flows, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other Risk Factors described herein. The degree to which the pandemic will impact us will depend in part on future developments, including the continued severity and duration of the outbreak, actions that may be taken by governmental authorities, and to what extent and when normal economic and operating conditions can resume.\nAdverse economic and market conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, or increases in interest rates could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and liquidity.\nDeteriorating, sluggish or volatile economic conditions in our operating jurisdictions could adversely impact our ability to maintain or grow our customer base and collect revenues from customers, which could reduce our revenue or growth rate and increase operating costs. The continued spread of COVID-19 has resulted in widespread impacts on the global economy and financial markets and could lead to a prolonged reduction in economic activity, disruptions to supply chains and capital markets, and reduced labor availability and productivity.\nIn connection with the pandemic, certain state regulatory commissions instituted disconnection moratoriums and the suspension of collection of late payment fees, deposits and reconnection fees, which impacted our ability to pursue our standard credit risk mitigation practices. Following the issuance of these moratoriums, certain of our regulated operations have been authorized to record a regulatory asset for bad debt expense above levels currently in rates. While several of these moratoriums remain in place, we have reinstated our common credit mitigation practices where moratoriums have expired. It is possible that such moratoriums will be extended or reinstated as the pandemic continues.\nIn addition, the pandemic has impacted our physical business operations, resulting in delays in conducting certain residential work and additional costs required to comply with pandemic-related health and safety protocols.\nFurther, we rely on access to the capital markets to finance our liquidity and long-term capital requirements, including expenditures for our utility infrastructure and to comply with future regulatory requirements, to the extent not satisfied by the cash flow generated by our operations. We have historically relied on long-term debt and on the issuance of equity securities to\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nNISOURCE INC.\nfund a portion of our capital expenditures and repay outstanding debt, and on short-term borrowings to fund a portion of day-to-day business operations. Successful implementation of our long-term business strategies, including capital investment, is dependent upon our ability to access the capital and credit markets, including the banking and commercial paper markets, on competitive terms and rates. An economic downturn or uncertainty, market turmoil, changes in tax policy, challenges faced by financial institutions, changes in our credit ratings, or a change in investor sentiment toward us or the utilities industry generally could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital or refinance debt. Reduced access to capital markets, increased borrowing costs, and/or lower equity valuation levels could reduce future earnings per share and cash flows. Refer to Note 15, \u201cLong-Term Debt,\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to outstanding long-term debt and maturities of that debt. In addition, any rise in interest rates may lead to higher borrowing costs, which may adversely impact reported earnings, cost of capital and capital holdings.\nIf, in the future, we face limits to the credit and capital markets or experience significant increases in the cost of capital or are unable to access the capital markets, it could limit our ability to implement, or increase the costs of implementing, our business plan, which, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and liquidity.\nMost of our revenues are subject to economic regulation and are exposed to the impact of regulatory rate reviews and proceedings.\nMost of our revenues are subject to economic regulation at either the federal or state level. As such, the revenues generated by us are subject to regulatory review by the applicable federal or state authority. These rate reviews determine the rates charged to customers and directly impact revenues. Our financial results are dependent on frequent regulatory proceedings in order to ensure timely recovery of costs and investments.\nThe outcomes of these proceedings are uncertain, potentially lengthy and could be influenced by many factors, some of which may be outside of our control, including the cost of providing service, the necessity of expenditures, the quality of service, regulatory interpretations, customer intervention, economic conditions and the political environment. Further, the rate orders are subject to appeal, which creates additional uncertainty as to the rates that will ultimately be allowed to be charged for services. The COVID-19 pandemic is another factor that will continue to influence the regulatory process, such as the implementation of disconnection moratoriums as discussed above and the risk of not being able to recover costs and/or returns on invested capital through raising rates during a pandemic, which has disproportionately impacted vulnerable customers and communities.\nAdditionally, the costs of complying with current and future changes in environmental and federal pipeline safety laws and regulations are expected to be significant, and their recovery through rates will also be contingent on regulatory approval.\nOur business operations are subject to economic conditions in certain industries.\nBusiness operations throughout our service territories have been and may continue to be adversely affected by economic events at the national and local level where our businesses operate. In particular, sales to large industrial customers, such as those in the steel, oil refining, industrial gas and related industries, are impacted by economic downturns, including the downturn resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic; geographic or technological shifts in production or production methods; and consumer demand for environmentally friendly products and practices. The U.S. manufacturing industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international competition, increasing costs, and fluctuating demand for its products. In addition, our results of operations are negatively impacted by lower revenues resulting from higher bankruptcies, predominately focused on commercial and industrial customers not able to sustain operations through the economic disruptions related to the pandemic.\nWe are exposed to risk that customers will not remit payment for delivered energy or services, and that suppliers or counterparties will not perform under various financial or operating agreements.\nOur extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Policy, involves considerable judgment by our employees and is based on an evaluation of a customer or counterparty\u2019s financial condition, credit history and other factors. We monitor our credit risk exposure by obtaining credit reports and updated financial information for customers and suppliers, and by evaluating the financial status of our banking partners and other counterparties by reference to market-based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and to traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies. Adverse economic conditions result in an increase in defaults by customers, suppliers and counterparties. As stated above, in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, certain state regulatory commissions instituted regulatory moratoriums that have impacted our ability to pursue our standard credit risk mitigation practices.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nNISOURCE INC.\nWe are a holding company and are dependent on cash generated by our subsidiaries to meet our debt obligations and pay dividends on our stock.\nWe are a holding company and conduct our operations primarily through our subsidiaries, which are separate and distinct legal entities. Substantially all of our consolidated assets are held by our subsidiaries. Accordingly, our ability to meet our debt obligations or pay dividends on our common stock and preferred stock is largely dependent upon cash generated by these subsidiaries. In the event a major subsidiary is not able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows to us, our ability to service our debt obligations or pay dividends could be negatively affected.\nCapital market performance and other factors may decrease the value of benefit plan assets, which then could require significant additional funding and impact earnings.\nThe performance of the capital markets affects the value of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. We have significant obligations in these areas and hold significant assets in these trusts as noted in Note 12, \"Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets are subject to market fluctuations and may yield uncertain returns, which fall below our projected rates of return. A decline in the market value of assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations under the defined benefit pension plan. Additionally, changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under these benefit plans; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, which could potentially increase funding requirements. Further, the funding requirements of the obligations related to these benefits plans may increase due to changes in governmental regulations and participant demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or longer life expectancy assumptions, as well as voluntary early retirements. In addition, lower asset returns result in increased expenses. Ultimately, significant funding requirements and increased pension or other postretirement benefit plan expense could negatively impact our results of operations and financial position.\nWe have significant goodwill. Any future impairments of goodwill could result in a significant charge to earnings in a future period and negatively impact our compliance with certain covenants under financing agreements.\nIn accordance with GAAP, we test goodwill for impairment at least annually and review our definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate its fair value might be below its carrying value. Goodwill is also tested for impairment when factors, examples of which include reduced cash flow estimates, a sustained decline in stock price or market capitalization below book value, indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.\nA significant charge in the future could impact the capitalization ratio covenant under certain financing agreements. We are subject to a financial covenant under our revolving credit facility, which requires us to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. As of December 31, 2020, the ratio was 62.5%.\nChanges in the method for determining LIBOR and the potential replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSome of our indebtedness, including borrowings under our revolving credit agreement, bears interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR. From time to time, we also enter into hedging instruments to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the LIBOR benchmark interest rate. In addition, these hedging instruments, as well as hedging instruments that our subsidiaries use for hedging natural gas price and basis risk, rely on LIBOR-based rates to calculate interest accrued on certain payments that may be required to be made under these agreements, such as late payments or interest accrued if any cash collateral should be held by a counterparty. Any changes announced by regulators in the method pursuant to which the LIBOR rates are determined may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in the reported LIBOR rates. If that were to occur, the level of interest payments we incur may change.\nIn July 2017, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d), which regulates LIBOR, announced that the FCA intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. In November 2020, the Board of Governors of the U.S. Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency collectively issued a statement encouraging banks to stop entering into financial contracts that use LIBOR as a reference rate as soon as possible, and no later than December 31, 2021. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. In the United States, efforts to identify a set of alternative U.S. dollar reference interest rates include proposals by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee of the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee has proposed the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") as its recommended alternative to LIBOR, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York began publishing SOFR rates in April 2018. SOFR is intended to be a\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nNISOURCE INC.\nbroad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight that is collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities. However, because SOFR is a broad U.S. Treasury repurchase agreement financing rate that represents overnight secured funding transactions, it differs fundamentally from LIBOR. For example, SOFR is a secured overnight rate, while LIBOR is an unsecured rate that represents interbank funding over different maturities. In addition, because SOFR is a transaction-based rate, it is backward-looking, whereas LIBOR is forward-looking. Because of these and other differences, there is no assurance that SOFR will perform in the same way as LIBOR would have performed at any time, and there is no guarantee that it is a comparable substitute for LIBOR.\nIn addition, although certain of our LIBOR based obligations provide for alternative methods of calculating the interest rate payable on certain of our obligations if LIBOR is not reported, which include, without limitation, requesting certain rates from major reference banks in London or New York, uncertainty as to the extent and manner of future changes may result in interest rates and/or payments that are higher than, lower than or that do not otherwise correlate over time with, the interest rates or payments that would have been made on our obligations if a LIBOR-based rate was available in its current form.\nLITIGATION, REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE RISKS\nThe outcome of legal and regulatory proceedings, investigations, inquiries, claims and litigation related to our business operations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\nWe are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings, investigations, inquiries, claims and litigation in connection with our business operations, including those related to the Greater Lawrence Incident, the most significant of which are summarized in Note 20, \u201cOther Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our insurance does not cover all costs and expenses that we have incurred or that we may incur in the future relating to the Greater Lawrence Incident, and may not fully cover incidents that could occur in the future. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the outcomes of such matters, there can be no assurance that the resolution of any particular claim or proceeding would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\nThe Greater Lawrence Incident has materially adversely affected and may continue to materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn connection with the Greater Lawrence Incident, we have incurred and will incur various costs and expenses. We have been subject to inquiries and investigations by government authorities and regulatory agencies regarding the Greater Lawrence Incident, including the Massachusetts DPU and the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office, as further described in Note 7, \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,\" Note 20-C. \"Legal Proceedings,\" and Note 20-E. \"Other Matters\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWhile we have recovered the full amount of our liability insurance coverage available under our policies, total expenses related to the incident have exceeded such amount. Expenses in excess of our liability insurance coverage have materially adversely affected and may continue to materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nWe may also incur additional costs associated with the Greater Lawrence Incident, beyond the amount currently anticipated, including in connection with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office investigation as well as civil litigation. Further, state or federal legislation may be enacted that would require us to incur additional costs by mandating various changes, including changes to our operating practice standards for natural gas distribution operations and safety. If we are unable to recover the capital cost of the gas pipeline replacement through the pending property insurance litigation related to this matter, or we incur a material amount of other costs, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nFurther, if it is determined in other matters that we did not comply with applicable statutes, regulations or rules in connection with the operations or maintenance of our natural gas system, and we are ordered to pay additional amounts in penalties, or other amounts, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur settlement with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in respect of federal charges in connection with the Greater Lawrence Incident may expose us to further penalties, liabilities and private litigation, and may impact our operations.\nOn February 26, 2020, the Company entered into a DPA and Columbia of Massachusetts entered into a plea agreement with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office to resolve the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office\u2019s investigation relating to the Greater Lawrence Incident, which was subsequently approved by the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts (the \"Court\"). See Note 20-C. \"Legal Proceedings\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The agreements impose various compliance and remedial obligations on the Company and Columbia of Massachusetts. Failure to comply with the terms of these agreements could result in further enforcement action by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, expose the Company and Columbia of Massachusetts\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nNISOURCE INC.\nto penalties, financial or otherwise, and subjects the Company to further private litigation, each of which could impact our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur businesses are subject to various laws, regulations and tariffs. We could be materially adversely affected if we fail to comply with such laws, regulations and tariffs or with any changes in or new interpretations of such laws, regulations and tariffs.\nOur businesses are subject to various laws, regulations and tariffs, including, but not limited to, those relating to natural gas pipeline safety, employee safety, the environment and our energy infrastructure. Existing laws, regulations and tariffs may be revised or become subject to new interpretations, and new laws, regulations and tariffs may be adopted or become applicable to us and our operations. In some cases, compliance with new laws, regulations and tariffs increases our costs. If we fail to comply with laws, regulations and tariffs applicable to us or with any changes in or new interpretations of such laws, regulations or tariffs, our financial condition, results of operations, regulatory outcomes and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nOur businesses are regulated under numerous environmental laws. The cost of compliance with these laws, and changes to or additions to, or reinterpretations of the laws, could be significant. Liability from the failure to comply with existing or changed laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur businesses are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and rules that regulate, among other things, air emissions, water usage and discharges, GHG and waste products such as coal combustion residuals. Compliance with these legal obligations require us to make expenditures for installation of pollution control equipment, remediation, environmental monitoring, emissions fees, and permits at many of our facilities. These expenditures are significant, and we expect that they will continue to be significant in the future. Furthermore, if we fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations or are found to have caused damage to the environment or persons, that failure or harm may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and damages against us, injunctions to remedy the failure or harm, and the inability to operate facilities as designed.\nExisting environmental laws and regulations may be revised and new laws and regulations seeking to change environmental regulation of the energy industry may be adopted or become applicable to us, with an increasing focus on both coal and natural gas. Revised or additional laws and regulations may result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on our facilities or increased compliance costs, which may not be fully recoverable from customers through regulated rates and could, therefore, impact our financial position, financial results and cash flow. Moreover, such costs could materially affect the continued economic viability of one or more of our facilities.\nAn area of significant uncertainty and risk are the laws concerning emission of GHG. While we continue to reduce GHG emissions through the retirement of coal-fired electric generation, increased sourcing of renewable energy, and priority pipeline replacement, energy efficiency programs, leak detection and repair, GHG emissions are currently an expected aspect of the electric and natural gas business. Revised or additional future GHG legislation and/or regulation related to the generation of electricity or the extraction, production, distribution, transmission, storage and end use of natural gas could materially impact our gas supply, financial position, financial results and cash flows.\nEven in instances where legal and regulatory requirements are already known or anticipated, the original cost estimates for environmental improvements, remediation of past environmental impact, or pollution reduction strategies and equipment can differ materially from the amount ultimately expended. The actual future expenditures depend on many factors, including the nature and extent of impact, the method of improvement, the cost of raw materials, contractor costs, and requirements established by environmental authorities. Changes in costs and the ability to recover under regulatory mechanisms could affect our financial position, financial results and cash flows.\nChanges in taxation and the ability to quantify such changes as well as challenges to tax positions could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are subject to taxation by the various taxing authorities at the federal, state and local levels where we do business. Legislation or regulation which could affect our tax burden could be enacted by any of these governmental authorities. For example, the TCJA includes numerous provisions that affect businesses, including changes to U.S. corporate tax rates, business-related exclusions, deductions and credits. The outcome of regulatory proceedings regarding the extent to which the effect of a change in corporate tax rate will impact customers and the time period over which the impact will occur could significantly impact future earnings and cash flows. Separately, a challenge by a taxing authority, changes in taxing authorities\u2019\nITEM 1A.
