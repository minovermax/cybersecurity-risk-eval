{"cik": "1103601", "company": "WGL HOLDINGS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-11-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe risk factors described below should be read in conjunction with other information included or incorporated by reference in this annual report on Form 10-K, including an in-depth discussion of these risks in the section entitled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nThe risk factors discussed below are separated into three sections. The first discusses those factors that affect the consolidated entity of WGL Holdings and all of its subsidiaries, including Washington Gas. The second section describes other risk factors affecting Washington Gas included under \u201cRisks Affecting Washington Gas.\" The final section focuses on those factors affecting non-utility entities.\nRISKS RELATING TO WGL AND ALL OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nThe proposed merger with AltaGas is subject to regulatory approval.\nOn January 25, 2017, WGL and AltaGas entered into a Merger Agreement for WGL to be combined with AltaGas in an all cash transaction valued at approximately $6.4 billion. Consummation of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of specified closing conditions, including (i) the approval of the Merger by the holders of more than two-thirds of the outstanding shares of WGL common stock, which was obtained on May 10, 2017, (ii) the receipt of regulatory approvals required to consummate the Merger, including approval from the Public Service Commission of the District of Columbia (PSC of DC), the Public Service Commission of Maryland (PSC of MD), the State Corporation Commission of Virginia (SCC of VA), the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the Committee On Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) (FERC, CFIUS and State Corporation Commission of Virginia approvals having been obtained on July 6, 2017, August 18, 2017 and October 20, 2017, respectively), (iii) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (HSR), which occurred on July 17, 2017, (iv) the absence of any order of any governmental authority and the absence of the enactment of any law, in each case that enjoins, prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of the Merger, and (v) other customary closing conditions, including (a) the accuracy of each party\u2019s representations and warranties (subject to customary materiality qualifiers), and (b) each party\u2019s compliance in all material respects with its obligations and covenants contained in the Merger Agreement. In addition, the obligations of AltaGas and its merger subsidiary to consummate the Merger are subject to (a) the absence of a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement) and (b) the required regulatory approvals and any law not imposing or requiring any undertakings, terms, conditions, obligations, commitments, sanctions or remedial actions that constitute a Burdensome Condition (as defined in the Merger Agreement).\nWGL may not receive the remaining required statutory approvals and other clearances for the Merger, or they may not be received in a timely manner. If such approvals are received, they may impose terms, conditions or restrictions (i) that cause a failure of the closing conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, or (ii) that could have a detrimental impact on the combined company following completion of the Merger. A substantial delay in obtaining the required authorizations, approvals or consents or the imposition of unfavorable terms, conditions or restrictions could prevent the completion of the Merger. Even though the waiting period under HSR has expired, government authorities could seek to block or challenge the Merger as they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest.\nFailure to complete the Merger could adversely affect WGL\u2019s stock price and future business operations and financial results.\nIf WGL is unable to consummate the Merger, holders of WGL common stock will not receive any payment for their shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement. WGL\u2019s ongoing business may be adversely affected and would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022 WGL would have paid significant transaction costs, and may in certain circumstances be obligated to pay a termination fee to AltaGas of $136 million;\n\u2022 the attention of management may have been diverted to the Merger rather than to operations and the pursuit of other opportunities;\n\u2022 though the merger terms contemplate management and employees remaining to operate WGL, there is the chance of the potential loss of key personnel, as personnel may feel uncertain about their future with the combined company;\nWGL Holdings, Inc.\nWashington Gas Light Company\nPart I\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\n\u2022 WGL will have been subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of business, which may prevent the Company from making certain acquisitions or dispositions or pursuing other business opportunities; and\n\u2022 the trading price of WGL\u2019s stock may decline if the market believes the Merger may not be completed.\nFailure to complete the Merger may result in negative publicity, additional litigation against WGL or its directors and officers, and a negative impression of WGL in the investment community. The occurrence of these events, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or the price of WGL\u2019s common stock.\nThe business of WGL and Washington Gas will be impacted by the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement.\nThe Merger Agreement restricts WGL, without AltaGas\u2019s consent (which will not be unreasonably withheld), from undertaking certain specified actions until the Merger occurs or the Merger Agreement terminates. These restrictions may prevent WGL from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities and making other changes to its business prior to completion of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement. For example, the Merger Agreement prohibits WGL from raising common equity capital. Given that Washington Gas is solely dependent on WGL to raise new common equity capital and to contribute that common equity to Washington Gas, WGL\u2019s inability to raise common equity could adversely affect both WGL's and Washington Gas\u2019 credit ratings and coverage ratios.\nWGL will incur significant costs associated with the Merger.\nWGL expects to incur significant costs associated with the Merger for financial advisory services, legal services, re-evaluation of share-based compensation and acceleration of executive compensation. Some of these costs have been and will continue to be incurred even if the Merger is not completed.\nWGL\u2019s business will be subject to uncertainties while the Merger is pending.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Merger on employees, suppliers and customers may have an adverse effect on WGL. Although WGL intends to take steps to reduce any adverse effects, these uncertainties may impair WGL\u2019s abilities to attract, retain and motivate employees until the Merger is completed and for a period of time thereafter.\nPotential future actions against WGL and its directors and officers challenging the Merger may prevent the Merger from being completed within the anticipated time frame.\nWGL and/or its directors and officers may potentially be named as defendants in class action lawsuits filed on behalf of public shareholders challenging the Merger and potentially seeking to enjoin the defendants from consummating the Merger on the agreed-upon terms.\nWGL is a holding company and we depend on the receipt of dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries to pay dividends on our common stock and to pay principal and interest on our outstanding debt.\nWGL is a holding company whose assets consist primarily of investments in subsidiaries. Accordingly, we conduct all of our operations through our subsidiaries. Our ability to pay dividends on our common stock and to pay principal and accrued interest on our outstanding debt depends on the payment of dividends to us by certain of our subsidiaries or the repayment of funds to us by our subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries, in turn, may be restricted from paying dividends, making repayments or making other distributions to us for financial, regulatory, legal or other reasons. The extent to which our subsidiaries are not able to pay dividends or repay funds to us may adversely affect our ability to pay dividends to holders of our common stock and principal and interest to holders of our debt, which could negatively affect WGL\u2019s stock price.\nIf we are unable to access sources of liquidity or capital, or if the cost of funds increases significantly, our business, financial results and strategic growth plans may be adversely affected.\nWGL and Washington Gas require access to sources of liquidity to fund our operations and to support our growth strategy. Our ability to obtain adequate and cost effective financing depends on the credit ratings of WGL and Washington Gas and the liquidity of financial markets. A material downgrade in WGL\u2019s or Washington Gas\u2019 credit ratings or disruptions in the capital or credit markets, including as a result of natural disasters and catastrophic events (including terrorist acts), could adversely affect our access to sources of liquidity and capital and increase our borrowing costs.\nWGL Holdings, Inc.\nWashington Gas Light Company\nPart I\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\nOur strategic growth plans assume that we will have continued access to liquidity and capital. In addition, the ability of our non-utility subsidiaries to purchase natural gas and electricity from their suppliers is partly dependent upon the creditworthiness of WGL, and upon access to cash collateral through the issuance of commercial paper and unsecured short-term bank loans by WGL. If WGL\u2019s credit ratings are materially downgraded, we may be required to provide additional credit support. If we are required to provide significant additional credit support, or if there is significant disruption in the credit markets, our ability to implement our strategic plans and the ability of our non-utility subsidiaries to make commodity purchases at reasonable prices may be impaired.\nIn addition, as a wholly owned subsidiary of WGL, Washington Gas depends solely on WGL to raise new common equity capital and to contribute that common equity to Washington Gas. If WGL is unable to raise common equity capital, as is currently the case while the Merger is pending, this also could adversely affect Washington Gas\u2019 credit ratings and its ability to earn its authorized rate of return. An increase in the interest rates Washington Gas pays without the recognition of the higher cost of debt in rates charged to its customers could materially affect future net income and cash flows.\nCyber-attacks, including cyber-terrorism or other information technology security breaches, or information technology failures may disrupt our business operations, increase our costs, lead to the disclosure of confidential information and damage our reputation.\nSecurity breaches of our information technology infrastructure, including cyber-attacks and cyber-terrorism, or other failures of our information technology infrastructure could lead to disruptions of our natural gas distribution operations and otherwise adversely impact our ability to safely and effectively operate our pipeline and distributed generation systems and serve our customers. In addition, an attack on or failure of information technology systems could result in the unauthorized release of customer, employee or Company data that is crucial to our operational security or could adversely affect our ability to deliver and collect on customer bills. Such security breaches of our information technology infrastructure could adversely affect our business reputation, diminish customer confidence, subject us to financial liability or increased regulation, increase our costs and expose us to material legal claims and liability and adversely affect our operations and financial results. We have implemented preventive, detective and remediation measures to manage these risks, and we maintain cyber risk insurance to mitigate the effects of these events. Nevertheless, these may not effectively protect all of our systems all of the time. To the extent that the occurrence of any of these cyber events is not fully covered by insurance, it could adversely affect WGL\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to meet our customers\u2019 requirements may be impaired if contracted supply is not available, if supplies are not delivered in a timely manner, if we lose key suppliers or if we are not able to obtain additional supplies during significant spikes in demand.\nWashington Gas must acquire adequate natural gas supply and pipeline and storage capacity to meet current and future customers\u2019 annual and seasonal natural gas requirements. Similarly, WGL Energy Services requires adequate natural gas and electric supplies to serve the demands of its customers and WGL Midstream requires adequate natural gas supply and storage and pipeline capacity to meet its delivery obligations to its customers. We depend on the ability of natural gas producers, pipeline gatherers, natural gas processors, interstate pipelines, suppliers of electricity and regional electric transmission operators to meet these requirements. If we are unable to secure adequate supplies in a timely manner because of a failure of our suppliers to deliver the contracted commodity, capacity or storage, if we are unable to secure additional quantities during significant abnormal weather conditions, or if Washington Gas' or WGL Energy Services' interruptible customers fail to comply with requests to curtail their gas usage during periods of sustained cold weather, we may be unable to meet our customers\u2019 requirements. Such inability could result in defaults under contracts with customers, penalties and financial damage payments, costs relating to procedures to recover from a disruption of service, the loss of key licenses and operating authorities, and the loss of customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nNatural disasters and catastrophic events, including terrorist acts, may adversely affect our business.\nNatural disasters and catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, tornados, terrorist acts, and other similar occurrences, could damage our operational assets, including utility facilities, information technology infrastructure, distributed generation assets and pipeline assets owned by investees of our non-utility subsidiaries. Such events could likewise damage the operational assets of our suppliers or customers. These events could disrupt our ability to meet customer requirements, significantly increase our response costs, and significantly decrease our revenues. Unanticipated events or a combination of events, failure in resources needed to respond to events, or a slow or inadequate response to events may have an adverse impact\nWGL Holdings, Inc.\nWashington Gas Light Company\nPart I\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\non our operations, financial condition, and results of operations. The availability of insurance covering catastrophic events, sabotage and terrorism may be limited or may result in higher deductibles, higher premiums, and more restrictive policy terms.\nWe are exposed to counterparty and contract-related risks that could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe extend credit to counterparties, including other utilities, holding companies, banks, gas exploration and production companies, government-backed utilities and other participants in the energy industry. Although we believe we have prudent policies in place to manage our credit risk, including credit policies, netting arrangements and margining provisions incorporated in contractual agreements, we may not be able to collect amounts owed to us, which could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.\nIn addition, we enter into agreements with counterparties relating to the sale, purchase and delivery of commodity, transportation capacity, energy system design and construction, investment terms, and other matters. Our decisions to enter into these agreements are based on our expectations about the ongoing viability of our counterparties, assumptions and expectations underlying pricing terms and conditions, and commercial terms and other matters. These expectations may prove to be incorrect or our counterparties may dispute key terms of our agreements in ways that we do not anticipate. Such developments could result in our incurring losses or otherwise not achieving anticipated financial returns, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We are currently involved in legal proceedings with Antero Resources (Antero) relating to a dispute over the gas being delivered under natural gas purchase contracts. WGL Midstream incurred approximately $15.2 million and $9.8 million in losses associated with this dispute for the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2017, respectively. Separately, Antero has initiated suit against Washington Gas and WGL Midstream, claiming that they have failed to purchase specified daily quantities of gas and seeking alleged cover damages exceeding $80 million as of October 24, 2017, which amount continues to accumulate daily according to Antero's complaint. Washington Gas and WGL Midstream oppose both the validity and amount of Antero\u2019s claim. If we are not successful in these proceedings, our results of operations would be negatively affected.\nOur risk management strategies and related hedging activities may not be effective in managing risks and may cause increased volatility in our earnings and, in our utility segment, may result in costs and losses for which rate recovery may be disallowed.\nWe are exposed to commodity price, weather and interest rate risks. In addition, WGL Energy Services is exposed to pricing of certain ancillary services provided by the power pool in which it operates.\nFor gas purchases to serve utility customers, Washington Gas attempts to manage its exposure to these risks, in part, through regulatory recovery mechanisms. Our other subsidiaries primarily seek to manage risks by matching natural gas and electricity purchase obligations with sales commitments in terms of volume and pricing. In addition, we attempt to mitigate risks by hedging, setting risk limits and employing other risk management tools and procedures. These risk management activities may not be effective, and cannot eliminate these risks in their entirety. If these tools and procedures are ineffective, we could incur significant losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and liquidity. In addition, although Washington Gas generally anticipates rate recovery of its costs or losses incurred in connection with these risk management activities, a regulator could subsequently disallow these costs or losses from the determination of revenues, which could adversely affect our financial results and increase the volatility of our earnings.\nRules implementing the derivatives transaction provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act regulates derivatives transactions, which include certain instruments, such as interest rate swaps, and commodity options, financial and other contracts, used in our risk management activities. The Dodd-Frank Act requires that most swaps be cleared through a registered clearing facility and that they be traded on a designated exchange or swap execution facility, with certain exceptions for entities that use swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk. The Dodd-Frank requirements relating to derivative transactions have not been fully implemented by the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. When fully implemented, the law and any new regulations could increase the operational and transactional cost of derivatives contracts and affect the number and/or creditworthiness of available counterparties.\nIn addition, we may transact with counterparties based in the European Union, Canada or other jurisdictions which, like the U.S., are in the process of implementing regulations to regulate derivatives transactions, some of which are currently in effect and may impose costs on our derivatives activities.\nWGL Holdings, Inc.\nWashington Gas Light Company\nPart I\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\nOur business, earnings and cash requirements are highly weather sensitive and seasonal.\nThe earnings of Washington Gas can vary from year to year depending, in part, on weather conditions. Warmer-than-normal weather can reduce our utility margins as customer consumption declines. In Maryland and Virginia, we have in place regulatory mechanisms and rate designs intended to stabilize the level of net revenues that we collect from customers by eliminating the effect of deviations in customer usage caused by variations in weather from normal levels, and other factors such as conservation. If our rates and tariffs are modified to eliminate these provisions, then we would be exposed to significant risk associated with weather.\nThe operations of WGL Energy Services, our retail energy-marketing subsidiary, are weather sensitive and seasonal, with a significant portion of revenues derived from the sale of natural gas to retail customers for space heating during the winter months, and from the sale of electricity to retail customers for cooling during the summer months. Weather conditions directly influence the volume of natural gas and electricity delivered to customers. Weather conditions can also affect the short-term pricing of energy supplies that WGL Energy Services may need to procure to meet the needs of its customers. Similarly, the business of WGL Midstream is seasonal due to the tendency of storage and transportation spreads to increase during the winter. In addition, the distributed generation operations of WGL Energy Systems, which derive significant revenues from the sale of electricity to customers from solar generating assets, are weather sensitive because weather conditions directly influence the generation of electricity that is delivered to customers.\nDeviations from normal weather conditions and the seasonal nature of these businesses can create large fluctuations in these subsidiaries\u2019 short-term cash requirements and earnings.\nWashington Gas and WGL Midstream may face regulatory and financial risks related to pipeline safety legislation.\nA number of proposals to require increased oversight over pipeline operations and increased investment in and inspections of pipeline facilities are pending or have previously been proposed in the United States Congress. Additional operating expenses and capital expenditures may be necessary to remain in compliance with the increased federal oversight resulting from such proposals. While we cannot predict with certainty the extent of these expenses and expenditures or when they will become effective, the adoption of such proposals could result in significant additional costs to Washington Gas\u2019 and WGL Midstream\u2019s businesses. Washington Gas may be unable to recover from customers through the regulatory process all or some of these costs and may be unable to earn its authorized rate of return on these costs.\nFailure of our service providers, including in connection with the transition of certain outsourcing relationships to new vendors, could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCertain of our information technology, customer service, supply chain, pipeline and infrastructure installation and maintenance, engineering, payroll and human resources functions that we rely on are provided by third party vendors. Some of these services may be provided by vendors from centers located outside of the United States. Services provided pursuant to these agreements could be disrupted due to events and circumstances beyond our control. Our reliance on these service providers could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRISKS RELATING TO WASHINGTON GAS\nChanges in the regulatory environment or unfavorable rate regulation may restrict or delay Washington Gas\u2019 ability to earn a reasonable rate of return on its capital invested to provide utility service and to recover fully its operating costs.\nWashington Gas is regulated by several regulatory commissions and agencies. These regulatory commissions generally have authority over many of the activities of Washington Gas\u2019 business including, but not limited to, the rates it charges to its customers, the amount and type of securities it can issue, the nature of investments it can make, the nature and quality of services it provides, safety standards, collection practices and other matters. These regulators also may modify Washington Gas\u2019 rates to change the level, type and methods that it utilizes to recover its costs, including the costs to acquire, store, transport and deliver natural gas. In addition, the regulatory environment and rate regulation can be affected by new laws and political considerations. Most significantly, we incur both planned and unplanned costs to operate, improve, maintain and repair our operational assets. The amount of these costs may vary from our expectations due to significant unanticipated repairs,\nWGL Holdings, Inc.\nWashington Gas Light Company\nPart I\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\nmaintenance and remediation of our assets, changes in legal and regulatory requirements, natural disasters, terrorism, changes in interest rates of our indebtedness and other events. To the extent these costs are not included in approved rates or tariffs, we seek our recovery through rate cases; however, the regulatory process may be lengthy and costs may be disallowed, causing us to suffer the negative financial effects of costs incurred without the benefit of rate relief. Additionally, the actions of regulatory commissions may restrict or delay Washington Gas\u2019 ability to earn a reasonable rate of return on invested capital.\nWashington Gas must acquire additional capacity to deliver natural gas into growth areas and it may not be able to do so in a timely manner.\nWashington Gas must acquire additional interstate pipeline transportation or storage capacity and construct transmission and distribution pipe to deliver additional capacity into growth areas on our system. The specific timing of any larger customer additions to our market may not be forecasted with sufficiently long lead time and the availability of these supply options to serve any of our customer additions may be limited by market supply and demand, the timing of Washington Gas\u2019 participation in new interstate pipeline construction projects, local permitting requirements and the ability to acquire necessary rights of way. These limitations could result in an interruption in Washington Gas\u2019 ability to satisfy the needs of some of its customers.\nLeaks, mechanical problems, incidents or other operational issues could affect public safety and the reliability of Washington Gas\u2019 distribution system, which could materially affect Washington Gas\u2019 results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWashington Gas\u2019 business is exposed to operational issues, hazards and risks inherent in storing and transporting natural gas that could affect the public safety and reliability of its distribution system. While Washington Gas, with support from each of its regulatory commissions, is accelerating the replacement of aging pipeline infrastructure prioritized on a risk-based approach, operating issues such as leaks, equipment problems and incidents, including explosions and fire, could result in legal liability, repair and remediation costs, increased operating costs, significant increased capital expenditures, regulatory fines and penalties and other costs and a loss of customer confidence. Any liabilities resulting from the occurrence of these events may not be fully covered by insurance, and Washington Gas may be unable to recover from customers through the regulatory process all of these repair, remediation and other costs and earn its authorized rate of return on these costs.\nWashington Gas has implemented preventive and remedial measures to address increased leak rates in its distribution system caused by an increase in the volume of natural gas containing low concentration of HHCs received from its suppliers. These measures include the injection of hexane to increase the concentration of HHCs and the implementation of pipe replacement programs. If Washington Gas were unable to inject hexane into its natural gas supply due to limited availability of hexane, equipment or operational problems, or damage to our facilities at which hexane is injected, our leak rates could increase, which would exacerbate the risks discussed above. In addition, Washington Gas\u2019 ability to continue to recover the cost of these preventive and remedial measures and to earn its authorized rate of return on these costs is subject to the regulatory process.\nCurrent and future environmental regulations may adversely affect Washington Gas\u2019 operations and financial results.\nWashington Gas is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations related to environmental matters. These evolving laws and regulations may require expenditures over a long timeframe. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may expose Washington Gas to fines, penalties and operational interruptions that could adversely affect its financial results. Moreover, new environmental requirements, revisions and reinterpretations of existing environmental requirements and changes in environmental enforcement policies and practices may stretch Washington Gas\u2019 operational resources and adversely affect its financial results.\nIn the past, the United States Congress has considered legislative proposals to limit greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Future proposals to limit GHG emissions could adversely affect our operating and service costs and demand for our product. Should future proposals become law, operating and service costs may increase and demand for our product could decrease, and utility costs and prices charged to utility customers may increase, which would adversely affect our financial results.\nChanges in the relative prices of alternative forms of energy may weaken the competitive position of Washington Gas\u2019 delivery service, which could reduce growth in natural gas customers, reduce the volume of natural gas delivered and negatively affect Washington Gas\u2019 cash flows and earnings.\nThe price of natural gas delivery service that Washington Gas provides competes with the price of other forms of energy such as electricity, oil and propane. An increase in the price of natural gas compared to other sources of energy may cause the\nWGL Holdings, Inc.\nWashington Gas Light Company\nPart I\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\ncompetitive position of our natural gas delivery service to decline. A decline in the competitive position of natural gas service may lead to fewer natural gas customers, lower volumes of natural gas delivered, lower cash flows and lower earnings.\nA decline in the local economy in which Washington Gas operates may reduce net revenue growth and reduce future earnings and cash flows.\nApproximately 75% of our assets are attributable to our regulated utility businesses, and the dividends paid by Washington Gas to WGL constituted approximately 85% of the amount of WGL Holdings' dividends paid for fiscal year 2017. Further, substantially all of our natural gas utility customers are located in Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia. A decline in the economy of the region in which Washington Gas operates or a change in the usage patterns and financial condition of customers in the region might adversely affect Washington Gas\u2019 ability to grow its customer base and collect revenues from existing customers, which may negatively affect net revenue growth and increase costs.\nWashington Gas\u2019 business and financial condition could be adversely impacted by strikes or work stoppages by its unionized employees.\nWashington Gas\u2019 business is dependent upon employees who are represented by unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Disputes with the unions could result in work stoppages that could impact the delivery of natural gas and other services, which could affect our relationships with customers, vendors and regulators and adversely affect Washington Gas\u2019 business and financial condition.\nThe availability of adequate interstate pipeline transportation capacity and natural gas supply may decrease.\nWe purchase almost all of our natural gas supply from interstate sources that must then be transported to our service territory. In particular, while the Marcellus Shale region is rapidly developing as a premier gas formation, the interstate pipeline transportation capacity may limit the availability of gas from Marcellus in the near term. A significant disruption to or reduction in interstate pipeline capacity due to events such as operational failures or disruptions, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, freeze off of natural gas wells, terrorist or cyber-attacks or other acts of war, or legislative or regulatory actions or requirements, including remediation related to integrity inspections, could reduce our normal interstate supply of gas, which may affect our ability to serve customer demand and may reduce our earnings.\nThe cost of providing retirement plan benefits to eligible current and former employees is subject to changes in the performance of investments, demographics, and other factors and assumptions. These changes may have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe cost of providing retirement plan benefits to eligible current and former employees is subject to changes in the market value of our retirement plan assets, changing bond yields, changing demographics and changing assumptions. Any sustained declines in equity markets, reductions in bond yields, increases in health care cost trends, or increases in life expectancy of beneficiaries may have an adverse effect on our retirement plan liabilities assets and benefit costs. Additionally, we may be required to increase our contributions in future periods in order to preserve the current level of benefits under the plans and/or due to federal funding requirements.\nRISKS RELATING TO THE NON-UTILITY SUBSIDIARIES OF WGL\nThe construction of WGL Midstream\u2019s pipeline assets have experienced and may continue to experience legislative and regulatory obstacles, and the construction and operation of these assets are subject to hazards, equipment failures, supply chain disruptions, personnel issues and related risks, which could result in decreased values of these investments, including impairments, and/or delays their in-service dates, which would negatively affect our results of operations.\nWGL Midstream\u2019s business plan involves making substantial investments in pipeline construction projects, which are subject to FERC and state agency regulation and approval. These construction projects are also subject to environmental, political and legal uncertainties that are beyond our control. These factors may reduce some opportunities to grow our midstream business or impair our existing investments.\nIn addition, the construction and operation of WGL Midstream\u2019s pipeline assets are subject to risks relating to breakdowns or failures of equipment or processes due to pipeline integrity, fuel supply or transportation disruptions, accidents, labor disputes or work stoppages, construction delays or cost overruns, and shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment, material\nWGL Holdings, Inc.\nWashington Gas Light Company\nPart I\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\nand labor. Because these assets are interconnected with facilities of third parties, the operation of these facilities could also be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events occurring on the systems of such third parties. These events could further delay the in-service date of WGL Midstream\u2019s projects or disrupt operations on these projects, which could have an adverse effect on its financial results.\nReturns on our non-utility subsidiaries\u2019 investments in renewable energy projects are dependent upon regulatory and tax incentives, which may expire or be reduced or modified.\nWGL Energy Systems derives a significant portion of its revenues from the sale of SRECs, which are produced as a result of owning and operating commercial distributed energy systems. The value of these SRECs is determined by markets in the states where the distributed energy systems are installed, which are driven by state laws relating to renewable portfolio standards or alternative compliance payment requirements for renewable energy. Overbuilding of distributed energy systems in these states or legislative changes reducing renewable portfolio standards or alternative compliance payment requirements could negatively impact the price of SRECs that we sell and the value of the SRECs that we hold in our portfolio.\nIn addition, WGL Energy Systems and WGSW\u2019s investment strategy to own and operate energy assets and sell energy to customers is based on the investment tax credit (ITC) provision in the federal tax code, which historically has allowed WGL to reduce its tax burden by investing in renewable and alternative energy assets, such as distributed energy, ductless heat pumps and fuel cells. WGL\u2019s ability to continue to benefit from the ITC is based on certain assumptions about the level of our income taxes, which could be negatively impacted by future changes in tax laws.\nWGL may be impacted by changes in federal income tax policy.\nWGL is impacted by the United States federal income tax policy, including corporate income tax laws. Both the new federal administration and Congress are considering comprehensive tax reform, including significant changes to the United States corporate income tax laws. Management is currently unable to predict whether these proposed reforms will result in any significant changes to existing tax laws, or if any such proposed tax changes would have a cumulative positive or negative impact on corporations, including WGL. A reduction in the federal statutory tax rate could result in an accelerated return of deferred federal income taxes to customers. This and other changes in the United States federal income tax laws could have an adverse effect on cash flow, financial condition, and liquidity.\nLegislative and regulatory developments and other uncertainties, delays or cost overruns may negatively affect WGL Energy Services or our other non-utility subsidiaries.\nLegislation or changes in the regulations that govern the conduct of competitive energy marketers could reduce customer growth opportunities for WGL Energy Services and could reduce the profit opportunities associated with existing customers. In addition, our non-utility subsidiaries hold investments in natural gas related businesses that are subject to laws and regulations that could adversely affect their performance.\nCompetition may negatively affect our non-utility subsidiaries.\nWe face strong competition in our non-utility segments. WGL Energy Services competes with other non-regulated retail suppliers of natural gas and electricity, as well as with the commodity rate offerings of electric and gas utilities. Increases in competition, including utility commodity rate offers that are below prevailing market rates, may result in a loss of sales volumes or a reduction in growth opportunities. WGL Midstream competes with other midstream infrastructure and energy services companies, wholesale energy suppliers and other non-utility affiliates of regulated utilities to acquire natural gas storage and transportation assets. WGL Energy Systems faces many competitors in the commercial energy systems segment, including, for government customers, companies that contract with customers under ESPC and other utilities providing services under UESCs and, in the renewable energy and distributed generation market, other developers, tax equity investors, distributed generation asset owner firms and lending institutions. These competitors may have diversified energy platforms with multiple marketing approaches, broader geographic coverage, greater access to credit and other financial resources, or lower cost structures, and may make strategic acquisitions or establish alliances among themselves. There can be no assurances that we can compete successfully, and our failure to do so could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flow.\nWGL subsidiaries invest in non-controlling interests in investments, and may have limited ability to manage risks associated with these investments.\nWGL Holdings, Inc.\nWashington Gas Light Company\nPart I\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\nWe own, and may acquire additional, non-controlling interests in investments.
