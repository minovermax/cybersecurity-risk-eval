The following is a description of the material risks and uncertainties that the Company believes affect its business and an investment in the common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties that the Company is unaware of, or that it currently deems immaterial, also may become important factors that affect the Company and its business. If any of the risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K were to occur, the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the value of the common stock could decline significantly and all or part of an investment could be lost.\nRisks Associated with the Company\u2019s Business\nInterest Rate Risks\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to interest rate risk, and fluctuations in interest rates may adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe majority of the Company\u2019s assets are monetary in nature, and, as a result, the Company is subject to significant risk from changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates can impact the Company\u2019s net interest income as well as the valuation of its assets and liabilities. The Company\u2019s earnings are significantly dependent on its net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income earned on loans, investments and other interest-earning assets and the interest expense paid on deposits, borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities.\nInterest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the Company\u2019s control, including general economic conditions, inflationary trends, changes in government spending and debt issuances and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Federal Open Market Committee. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence the interest the Company receives on loans and securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings, and could also affect (1) the Company\u2019s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, (2) the fair value of the Company\u2019s financial assets and liabilities and (3) the average duration of the Company\u2019s mortgage-backed securities portfolio. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, the Company\u2019s net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings also could be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments decrease more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. Further, the Company\u2019s assets and liabilities may react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions because there may be mismatches between the repricing or maturity characteristics of the assets and liabilities. Any substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company may be adversely impacted by the transition from LIBOR as a reference rate.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority and the administrator of LIBOR have announced that the publication of the most commonly used U.S. dollar London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) settings will cease to be published or cease to be representative after June 30, 2023. The publication of all other LIBOR settings ceased to be published as of December 31, 2021. Given consumer protection, litigation, and reputation risks, the bank regulatory agencies have indicated that entering into new contracts that use LIBOR as a reference rate after December 31, 2021, would create safety and soundness risks and that they will examine bank practices accordingly. Therefore, the agencies encouraged banks to cease entering into new contracts that use LIBOR as a reference rate as soon as practicable and in any event by December 31, 2021. The Company discontinued originating LIBOR-based loans effective December 31, 2021 and will negotiate loans after that date using the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) or BSBY, a benchmark developed by Bloomberg Index Services.\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately $2.1 billion of the Company\u2019s outstanding loans, and, in addition, certain derivative contracts, borrowings and other financial instruments have attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR. The transition from LIBOR has resulted in and could continue to result in added costs and employee efforts and could present additional risk. The Company is subject to litigation and reputational risks if it is unable to renegotiate and amend existing contracts with counterparties that are dependent on LIBOR, including contracts that do not have fallback language. The timing and manner in which each customer\u2019s contract transitions to a replacement rate will vary on a case-by-case basis. There continues to be substantial uncertainty as to the ultimate effects of the LIBOR transition, including with respect to the acceptance and use of SOFR, BSBY and other benchmark rates. Since any replacement rate will be calculated differently, payments under contracts referencing new rates will differ from those referencing LIBOR, which may lead to increased volatility as compared to LIBOR. The transition has impacted the Company\u2019s market risk profiles and required changes to its risk and pricing models, valuation tools, product design and hedging strategies. Furthermore, failure to adequately manage this transition process with the Company\u2019s customers could adversely impact its reputation. Although the Company is currently unable to assess what the ultimate impact of the transition from LIBOR will be, failure to adequately manage the transition could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCredit and Lending Risks\nThe Company\u2019s business depends on its ability to successfully manage credit risk.\nThe Company\u2019s business depends on its ability to successfully measure and manage credit risk. As a lender, the Company is exposed to the risk that the principal of, or interest on, a loan will not be repaid timely or at all or that the value of any collateral supporting a loan will be insufficient to cover the Company\u2019s outstanding exposure. In addition, the Company is exposed to risks with respect to the period of time over which the loan may be repaid, risks relating to proper loan underwriting, risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions, and risks inherent in dealing with individual loans and borrowers. The creditworthiness of a borrower is affected by many factors including local market conditions and general economic conditions. If the overall economic climate in the United States, generally, or the Company\u2019s market areas, specifically, experiences material disruption, the Company\u2019s borrowers may experience difficulties in repaying their loans, the collateral the Company holds may decrease in value or become illiquid, and the level of nonperforming loans, charge-offs and delinquencies could rise and require significant additional provisions for credit losses. Additional factors related to the credit quality of commercial loans include the quality of the management of the business and the borrower\u2019s ability to properly evaluate changes in the supply and demand characteristics affecting their market for products and services, to evaluate regulatory changes affecting their products and services, such as climate change regulation, and to effectively respond to those changes. Additional factors related to the credit quality of commercial real estate loans include tenant vacancy rates and the quality of management of the property.\nThe Company\u2019s risk management practices, such as monitoring the concentration of the Company\u2019s loans within specific industries and the Company\u2019s credit approval, review and administrative practices, may not adequately reduce credit risk, and the Company\u2019s credit administration personnel, policies and procedures may not adequately adapt to changes in economic or any other conditions affecting customers and the quality of the loan portfolio. Many of the Company\u2019s loans are made to businesses that are less able to withstand competitive, economic and financial pressures than larger borrowers. Consequently, the Company may have significant exposure if any of these borrowers becomes unable to pay their loan obligations as a result of economic or market conditions, or personal circumstances, such as divorce or death. A failure to effectively measure and limit the credit risk associated with the Company\u2019s loan portfolio may result in loan defaults, foreclosures and additional charge-offs, and may necessitate that the Company significantly increase its allowance for credit losses, each of which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s net income. As a result, the Company\u2019s inability to successfully manage credit risk could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover actual credit losses, which could adversely affect its earnings.\nAs a lender, the Company is exposed to the risk that its loan customers may not repay their loans according to the terms of these loans and the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to fully compensate the Company for the outstanding balance of the loan plus the costs to dispose of the collateral. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses in an attempt to cover estimated losses inherent in its loan portfolio. Additional credit losses could occur in the future and may occur at a rate greater than the Company has experienced to date. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires the Company to make significant estimates of current credit risks, future trends and general economic conditions, all of which may undergo material changes. If the Company\u2019s assumptions prove to be incorrect or if it experiences significant credit losses in future periods, its current allowance may not be sufficient to cover actual credit losses and adjustments may be necessary to allow for different economic conditions or adverse developments in its loan portfolio. A material addition to the allowance could cause net income, and possibly capital, to decrease.\nIn addition, federal and state regulators periodically review the Company\u2019s allowance for credit losses and may require the Company to increase its provision for credit losses or recognize further charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of the Company\u2019s management. An increase in the Company\u2019s allowance for credit losses or charge-offs as required by these regulatory agencies could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operating results and financial condition.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board\u2019s accounting standard, ASU 2016-13, which established allowances for credit losses became effective for the Company on January 1, 2020. This methodology, known as CECL, reflects the expected credit losses over the lives of financial assets starting when such assets are first acquired. Under this methodology, credit losses are measured based on past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of financial assets. The standard resulted in an increase to allowance and required the application of the revised methodology to existing financial assets through a one-time adjustment to retained earnings. See \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 1-Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies-New Accounting Pronouncements\u201d for additional information about the standard.\nThe Company\u2019s profitability depends significantly on local economic conditions.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends primarily on the general economic conditions of the primary markets in Texas and Oklahoma in which it operates and where its loans are concentrated. The local economic conditions in Texas and Oklahoma have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s commercial, real estate and construction, land development and other land loans; the ability of its borrowers to repay their loans; and the value of the collateral securing these loans. Accordingly, if the population or income growth in the Company\u2019s market areas is slower than projected, income levels, deposits and housing starts could be adversely affected and could result in a reduction of the Company\u2019s expansion, growth and profitability. In addition, due to the large number of oil and gas companies in the Company\u2019s market areas, the volatility in oil prices may negatively impact economic conditions in these areas. If the Company\u2019s market areas experience a downturn or a recession for a prolonged period of time, the Company could experience significant increases in nonperforming loans, which could lead to operating losses, impaired liquidity and eroding capital. A significant decline in general economic conditions, caused by inflation, an increase or decline in commodity prices, recession, weather extremes, acts of terrorism, outbreaks of hostilities or other international or domestic calamities, unemployment or other factors could impact these local economic conditions and could negatively affect the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s dependence on loans secured by real estate subjects it to risks relating to fluctuations in the real estate market that could adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nApproximately 73.4% of the Company\u2019s total loans as of December 31, 2021 consisted of loans included in the real estate loan portfolio, with 30.6% in commercial real estate (including farmland and multifamily residential), 30.4% in residential real estate (including home equity) and 12.4% in construction, land development and other land loans. The real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended. A weakening of the real estate market in the Company\u2019s primary market areas could have an adverse effect on the demand for new loans, the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, the value of real estate and other collateral securing the loans and the value of real estate owned by the Company. If real estate values decline, it is also more likely that the Company would be required to increase its allowance for credit losses, which could adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s commercial real estate and commercial loans expose it to increased credit risks, and these risks will increase if the Company succeeds in increasing these types of loans.\nThe Company, while maintaining its conservative approach to lending, has emphasized both new and existing loan products, focusing on managing its commercial real estate (including farmland and multifamily residential) and commercial loan portfolios, and intends to continue to increase its lending activities and acquire loans in possible future acquisitions. As a result, commercial real estate and commercial loans as a proportion of its portfolio could increase. As of December 31, 2021, commercial real estate (including farmland and multifamily residential) and commercial loans totaled $8.41 billion. In general, commercial real estate loans and commercial loans yield higher returns and often generate a deposit relationship, but also pose greater credit risks than do owner-occupied residential real estate loans. These types of loans are also typically larger than residential real estate loans. Accordingly, the deterioration of one or several of these loans could cause a significant increase in nonperforming loans, which could result in a loss of earnings from these loans and an increase in the provision for credit losses and net charge-offs.\nThe Company makes both secured and some unsecured commercial loans. Unsecured loans generally involve a higher degree of risk of loss than do secured loans because, without collateral, repayment is wholly dependent upon the success of the borrowers\u2019 businesses. Secured commercial loans are generally collateralized by accounts receivable, inventory, equipment or other assets owned by the borrower and include a personal guaranty of the business owner. Compared to real estate, that type of collateral is more difficult to monitor, its value is harder to ascertain, it may depreciate more rapidly and it may not be as readily saleable if repossessed. Further, commercial loans generally will be serviced primarily from the operation of the business, which may not be successful, while commercial real estate loans generally will be serviced from income on the properties securing the loans. As the Company\u2019s various commercial loan portfolios increase, the corresponding risks and potential for losses from these loans will also increase.\nThe Company may be adversely affected by weaknesses in the commercial real estate market.\nAs of December 31, 2021, commercial real estate loans (including multifamily residential) comprised approximately 28.2% of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio. Commercial real estate loans generally involve a greater degree of credit risk than residential real estate loans because they typically have larger balances and are more affected by adverse conditions in the economy. Because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate often depend upon the successful operation and management of the properties and the businesses which operate from within them, repayment of such loans may be affected by factors outside the borrower\u2019s control, such as adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy or changes in government regulations. Commercial real estate markets have been impacted by the economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has also been a catalyst for the evolution of various remote work options which could impact the long-term performance of some types of office properties within the Company\u2019s commercial real estate portfolio. A failure by the Company to have adequate risk management policies, procedures and controls could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to increase this portfolio going forward and could result in an increased rate of delinquencies in, and increased losses from, this portfolio, which, accordingly, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s Warehouse Purchase Program balances can fluctuate widely.\nBecause Warehouse Purchase Program balances are contingent upon residential mortgage lending activity, changes in the residential real estate market nationwide can lead to wide fluctuations of balances in this product, materially impacting both interest and non-interest income. Additionally, Warehouse Purchase Program period-end balances are generally higher than the average balance during the period due to increased mortgage activity that occurs at the end of a month, which can significantly impact the Company\u2019s reported capital ratios.\nThe Company\u2019s loan portfolio, and specifically its energy lending portfolio, could be impacted by declines in the prices of oil and natural gas, as well as other factors.\nLoans to oil and gas production and service companies, which are reported as commercial and industrial loans, totaled $491.3 million (net of discount and excluding PPP loans totaling $27.9 million) at December 31, 2021, representing approximately 2.9% of total loans, excluding Warehouse Purchase Program loans. As a result, the factors that impact the energy sector may have a greater effect on the Company than on more broadly diversified financial institutions. Companies with exposure to the energy sector, whether directly or indirectly, are subject to volatile fluctuations in price and supply of oil and gas. Many factors affect the supply of and demand for crude oil and natural gas and, therefore, influence prices of these commodities, including:\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas, including increased availability of non-traditional energy resources such as shale oil and gas;\n\u2022\nprices, and expectations about future prices, of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\ndomestic and worldwide economic conditions, and the resulting global demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe price and quantity of imports of foreign oil and natural gas including the ability of OPEC to set and maintain production levels for oil, and decisions by OPEC and non-OPEC producers to change production levels;\n\u2022\nsanctions imposed by the U.S., the European Union, or other governments against oil producing countries;\n\u2022\nthe cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe level of excess production capacity, available pipeline, storage and other transportation capacity;\n\u2022\nlead times associated with acquiring equipment and products and availability of qualified personnel;\n\u2022\nthe expected rates of decline in production from existing and prospective wells;\n\u2022\nthe discovery rates of new oil and gas reserves;\n\u2022\nfederal, state and local regulation of exploration and drilling activities and oil and gas exports, including climate change regulation;\n\u2022\nlegislative and regulatory interest within, federal, state and local governments to stop, significantly limit or regulate hydraulic fracturing (fracking) activities;\n\u2022\nweather conditions, including hurricanes, that can affect oil and natural gas operations over a wide area and severe winter weather that can interfere with oil and gas development and production operations;\n\u2022\npolitical instability and social unrest in oil and natural gas producing countries;\n\u2022\nadvances in exploration, development and production technologies or in technologies affecting energy consumption (such as fracking);\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of alternative fuel and energy sources;\n\u2022\nuncertainty in capital and commodities markets; and\n\u2022\nchanges in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other major global currencies.\nFurther, the economy in Texas as a whole could be negatively impacted if there are a high number of jobs lost related to a decline in oil production in the state, or if the impact of lower oil prices negatively affects other industries. A decline in the Texas economy related to oil production decline could impact the Company\u2019s loan portfolios outside of the energy portfolio, if borrowers experience unemployment or loss of income and are unable to make payments on their loans.\nThe Company is subject to losses resulting from fraudulent and negligent acts on the part of loan applicants, correspondents or other third parties.\nThe Company relies heavily upon information supplied by third parties, including the information contained in credit applications, property appraisals, title information, equipment pricing and valuation and employment and income documentation, in deciding which loans the Company will originate, as well as the terms of those loans. If any of the information upon which the Company relies is misrepresented, either fraudulently or inadvertently, and the misrepresentation is not detected prior to asset funding, the value of the asset may be significantly lower than expected, or the Company may fund a loan that it would not have funded or on terms it would not have extended. Whether a misrepresentation is made by the applicant or another third party, the Company generally bears the risk of loss associated with the misrepresentation. A loan subject to a material misrepresentation is typically unsellable or subject to repurchase if it is sold prior to detection of the misrepresentation. The sources of the misrepresentations are often difficult to locate, and it is often difficult to recover any of the monetary losses the Company may suffer.\nThe Company is subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities.\nA significant portion of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, the Company may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans, and there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, the Company may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require the Company to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit the Company\u2019s ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase the Company\u2019s exposure to environmental liability. Although the Company has policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on real property, these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation\ncosts and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nLiquidity Risks\nLiquidity risk could impair the Company\u2019s ability to fund operations and jeopardize its financial condition.\nLiquidity is essential to the Company\u2019s business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on its liquidity. The Company\u2019s access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance its activities or on terms which are acceptable to it could be impaired by factors that affect the Company specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact the Company\u2019s access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of its business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which its loans are concentrated or adverse regulatory action against it. The Company\u2019s ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to it, such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry in light of the recent turmoil faced by banking organizations and the continued deterioration in credit markets.\nThe Company relies on customer deposits as a significant source of funding, and its deposits may decrease in the future.\nThe Company relies on customer deposits as a significant source of funding. Competition among U.S. banks for customer deposits is intense, and may increase the cost of deposits or prevent new deposits, and may otherwise negatively affect the Company\u2019s ability to grow its deposit base. The Company\u2019s deposit accounts may decrease in the future, and any such decrease could have an adverse impact on its sources of funding, which impact could be material. Any changes the Company makes to the rates offered on its deposit products to remain competitive with other financial institutions may adversely affect its profitability and liquidity. The demand for the deposit products the Company offers may also be reduced due to a variety of factors such as demographic patterns, changes in customer preferences, reductions in consumers\u2019 disposable income, regulatory actions that decrease customer access to particular products or the availability of competing products.\nThe Company may need to raise additional capital in the future and such capital may not be available when needed on acceptable terms or at all.\nThe Company may need to raise additional capital in the future to provide it with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet regulatory capital requirements or its commitments and business needs. In addition, the Company may elect to raise additional capital to support its business or to finance acquisitions, if any. If needed, the Company\u2019s ability to raise additional capital will depend on many things, including conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside its control, and its financial performance.\nSuch capital may not be available to the Company on acceptable terms or at all. Any occurrence that may limit the Company\u2019s access to the capital markets, such as a decline in the confidence of investors, depositors of the Bank or counterparties participating in the capital markets, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s capital costs and its ability to raise capital and, in turn, its liquidity. Moreover, if the Company needs to raise capital in the future, it may have to do so when many other financial institutions are also seeking to raise capital and would have to compete with those institutions for investors. An inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nStrategic Risks\nIf the Company is not able to continue its historical levels of growth, it may not be able to maintain its historical earnings trends.\nTo achieve its past levels of growth, the Company has focused on both internal growth and acquisitions. The Company may not be able to sustain its historical rate of growth or may not be able to grow at all. More specifically, the Company may not be able to obtain the financing necessary to fund additional growth and may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates. Various factors, such as economic conditions, competition and heightened regulatory scrutiny, may impede or prohibit the opening of new banking centers and the completion of acquisitions. Further, the Company may be unable to attract and retain experienced bankers, which could adversely affect its internal growth. If the Company is not able to continue its historical levels of growth, it may not be able to maintain its historical earnings trends.\nIf the Company is unable to manage its growth effectively, its operations and profitability could be negatively affected.\nThe Company faces a variety of risks and difficulties pursuing its growth strategy, including:\n\u2022\nfinding suitable markets for expansion;\n\u2022\nfinding suitable candidates for acquisition;\n\u2022\nattracting funding to support additional growth;\n\u2022\nmaintaining asset quality;\n\u2022\nattracting and retaining qualified management;\n\u2022\nmanaging execution risks;\n\u2022\nmaintaining adequate regulatory capital; and\n\u2022\nscaling technology platforms.\nIn addition, in order to manage its growth and maintain adequate information and reporting systems within its organization, the Company must identify, hire and retain additional qualified associates, particularly in the accounting and operational areas of its business.\nIf the Company does not manage its growth effectively, its business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects could be negatively affected, and the Company may not be able to continue to implement its business strategy and successfully conduct its operations.\nIf the Company is unable to identify and acquire other financial institutions and successfully integrate its acquired businesses, its business and earnings may be negatively affected.\nThe market for acquisitions remains highly competitive, and the Company may be unable to find acquisition candidates in the future that fit its acquisition and growth strategy. To the extent that the Company is unable to find suitable acquisition candidates, an important component of its growth strategy may be lost.\nAcquisitions of financial institutions involve operational risks and uncertainties and acquired companies may have unforeseen liabilities, exposure to asset quality problems, key employee and customer retention problems and other problems that could negatively affect the Company\u2019s organization. The Company may not be able to complete future acquisitions; and, if completed, the Company may not be able to successfully integrate the operations, management, products and services of the entities that it acquires and eliminate redundancies. The integration process could result in the loss of key employees or disruption of the combined entity\u2019s ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or achieve the anticipated benefits of the transaction. The integration process may also require significant time and attention from the Company\u2019s management that they would otherwise direct at servicing existing business and developing new business. The Company\u2019s inability to find suitable acquisition candidates or failure to successfully integrate the entities it acquires into its existing operations may increase its operating costs significantly and adversely affect its business and earnings. Acquisitions may also result in potential dilution to existing shareholders of the Company\u2019s earnings per share if the Company issues common stock in connection with an acquisition.\nAcquisitions may be delayed, impeded, or prohibited due to regulatory issues.\nAcquisitions by financial institutions are subject to approval by a variety of federal and state regulatory agencies. The process for obtaining these required regulatory approvals has become substantially more difficult in recent years and may become even more challenging following the review of the merger application process by the federal banking agencies and potentially the CFPB and the review of the competitive effects process by the Department of Justice. Regulatory approvals could be delayed, impeded, restrictively conditioned or denied due to existing or new regulatory issues the Company has, or may have, with regulatory agencies, including, without limitation, issues related to Bank Secrecy Act compliance, Community Reinvestment Act issues, fair lending laws, fair housing laws, consumer protection laws, unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices regulations and other similar laws and regulations. The Company may fail to pursue, evaluate or complete strategic and competitively significant acquisition opportunities as a result of its inability, or perceived or anticipated inability, to obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner, under reasonable conditions or at all. Difficulties associated with potential acquisitions that may result from these factors could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the goodwill that the Company recorded in connection with a business acquisition becomes impaired, it could require charges to earnings.\nGoodwill represents the amount by which the acquisition cost exceeds the fair value of net assets the Company acquired in the purchase of another financial institution. The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset might be impaired.\nThe Company determines impairment by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Any such adjustments are reflected in the Company\u2019s results of operations in the periods in which they become known. At December 31, 2021, the Company\u2019s goodwill totaled $3.23 billion. Although the Company has not recorded any such impairment charges since it initially recorded the goodwill, the Company\u2019s future evaluations of goodwill could result in findings of impairment and related write-downs, which may have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nOperational Risks\nThe Company\u2019s accounting estimates and risk management processes rely on analytical and forecasting models and tools that may prove to be inaccurate.\nThe processes the Company uses to estimate its expected credit losses and to measure the fair value of financial instruments, as well as the processes used to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations, depend upon the use of analytical and forecasting models and tools. These models and tools reflect assumptions that may not be accurate, particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances. Even if these assumptions are accurate, the models and tools may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate because of other flaws in their design or their implementation. Any such failure in the Company\u2019s analytical or forecasting models and tools could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAn interruption in or breach in security of the Company\u2019s information systems may result in a loss of customer business and have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe Company relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems, whether caused by physical damage, hackers, viruses or other malware, could jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through the Company\u2019s computer systems and network infrastructure as well as result in failures or disruptions in the Company\u2019s customer relationship management, general ledger, deposits, servicing or loan origination systems. While the Company maintains specific \u201ccyber\u201d insurance coverage, which the Company expects would apply in the event of various breach scenarios, the amount of coverage may not be adequate in any particular case. In addition, cyber threat scenarios are inherently difficult to predict and can take many forms, some of which may not be covered under the Company\u2019s cyber insurance coverage. Although the Company, with the help of third-party service providers, has and intends to continue to implement security technology and operational procedures to prevent such damage, these security measures may not entirely mitigate these risks. In addition, increases in cyber threats and the sophistication of bad actors, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms the Company and its third-party service providers use to protect client transaction data. Although the Company makes significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of its information systems and has implemented various measures to manage the risks of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. The occurrence of any such failures, interruptions or security breaches could damage the Company\u2019s reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject the Company to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose the Company to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe Company is subject to certain risks in connection with its use of technology.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The Company\u2019s future success depends in part upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience as well as create additional efficiencies in its operations. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. The Company may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers, which may negatively affect the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Further, as technology advances, the ability to initiate transactions and access data has become more widely distributed among mobile devices, personal computers, automated teller machines, remote deposit capture sites and similar access\npoints. These technological advances increase cybersecurity risk. While the Company maintains programs intended to prevent or limit the effects of cybersecurity risk, there is no assurance that unauthorized transactions or unauthorized access to customer information will not occur. The financial, reputational and regulatory impact of unauthorized transactions or unauthorized access to customer information could be significant.\nThe Company\u2019s operations rely on external vendors, which may fail to provide adequate services.\nThe Company relies on certain external vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain its day-to-day operations. These third parties provide key components of the Company\u2019s business operations such as data processing, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, internet connections and network access. While the Company has selected these third-party vendors carefully, it does not control their actions. Any complications caused by these third parties, including those resulting from disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, cyber-attacks and security breaches at a vendor, failure of a vendor to provide services for any reason or poor performance of services could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to deliver products and services to its customers and otherwise conduct its business. Financial or operational difficulties of a third-party vendor could also hurt the Company\u2019s operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendor\u2019s ability to provide services. Furthermore, the Company\u2019s vendors could also be sources of operational and information security risk, including from breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints, and reputational risk. Replacing these third-party vendors could also create significant delay and expense. Problems caused by external vendors could be disruptive to the Company\u2019s operations, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business and, in turn, the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business may be adversely affected by consolidations of technology vendors.\nThe Company relies on certain external vendors for core products and services. Consolidations among core vendors may have the effect of decreasing price competition that may lead to higher vendor costs and may also increase systemic risk from vendors that could affect the Company\u2019s operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business may be adversely affected by security breaches at third parties.\nThe Company\u2019s customers interact with their own and other third-party systems, which pose operational risks to the Company. The Company may be adversely affected by data breaches at retailers and other third parties who maintain data relating to the Company\u2019s customers that involve the theft of customer data, including the theft of customers\u2019 debit card, credit card, wire transfer and other identifying and/or access information used to make purchases or payments at such retailers and to other third parties. Despite third-party security risks that are beyond the Company\u2019s control, the Company offers its customers protection against fraud and attendant losses for unauthorized use of debit and credit cards in order to stay competitive in the marketplace. Offering such protection to customers exposes the Company to significant expenses and potential losses related to reimbursing the Company\u2019s customers for fraud losses, reissuing the compromised cards and increased monitoring for suspicious activity. In the event of a data breach at one or more retailers of considerable magnitude, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s risk management framework may not be effective in identifying, managing or mitigating risks and/or losses to it.\nThe Company has implemented a risk management framework to identify and manage its risk exposure, which is reviewed and overseen by the Company\u2019s Risk Committee. This framework consists of various processes, systems and strategies, and is designed to manage the types of risk to which the Company is subject, including, among others, credit, market, liquidity, operational, financial, interest rate, legal and regulatory, compliance, strategic, reputation, fiduciary and general economic risks. The Company\u2019s framework also includes financial or other modeling methodologies, which involves management assumptions and judgment. In addition, under this framework, the Company has developed a risk appetite statement to detail its risk tolerance levels at an enterprise-wide level. This risk management framework may not be effective under all circumstances, and it may not adequately identify, manage or mitigate all or any risk or loss to the Company. If this framework is not effective, the Company may be subject to potentially adverse regulatory consequences and could suffer unexpected losses and its financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nGeneral Risks\nNegative publicity could damage the Company\u2019s reputation and business.\nReputation risk, or the risk to earnings and capital from negative public opinion, is inherent in the Company\u2019s business. Negative public opinion could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to keep and attract customers and expose it to adverse legal and regulatory consequences. Negative public opinion could result from the Company\u2019s actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, corporate governance, regulatory compliance, mergers and acquisitions, and disclosure, sharing or inadequate protection of customer information, and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to that conduct. Negative public opinion could also result from adverse news or publicity that impairs the reputation of the financial services industry generally.\nFailure to compete effectively for customers could adversely affect the Company\u2019s growth and profitability, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company faces substantial competition in all areas of its operations from a variety of different competitors, many of which are larger and may have more financial resources. These competitors primarily include national, regional, and community banks within the various markets where the Company operates. The Company also faces competition from many other types of financial institutions, including savings and loans, credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies and other financial intermediaries. The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Also, technology and other changes have lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services functionally equivalent to those provided by banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as \u201cdisintermediation,\u201d could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. Further, many of the Company\u2019s competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. Additionally, due to their size, many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than the Company can. Failure to compete effectively for deposit, loan and other banking customers in the Company\u2019s market areas could adversely affect the Company\u2019s growth and profitability, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. The Company has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose the Company to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, the Company\u2019s credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by the Company cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to the Company. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nNew lines of business or new products and services may subject the Company to additional risks.\nFrom time to time, the Company may implement or acquire new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services, the Company may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. Furthermore, any new line of business and/or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLegal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks\nThe Company operates in a highly regulated environment and, as a result, is subject to extensive regulation and supervision.\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors\u2019 funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not the Company\u2019s shareholders. These regulations affect the Company\u2019s lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and\ngrowth, among other things. Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. Any change in applicable regulations or federal or state legislation could have a substantial impact on the Company, the Bank and their respective operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, instituted major changes to the banking and financial institutions regulatory regimes in light of the performance of and government intervention in the financial services sector during the several years prior to the implementation of such Act. Additional legislation and regulations or regulatory policies and other changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies, could significantly affect the Company\u2019s powers, authority and operations, or the powers, authority and operations of the Bank in substantial and unpredictable ways. Further, regulators have significant discretion and power to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of laws by banks and bank holding companies in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties. Government authorities, including the bank regulatory agencies, are pursuing aggressive enforcement actions with respect to compliance and other legal matters involving financial activities, which heightens the risks associated with actual and perceived compliance failures. The exercise of this regulatory discretion and power could have a negative impact on the Company. Further, failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage. In some instances, directives issued to enforce such actions may be confidential and thus, in those instances, the Company would not be permitted to publicly disclose these actions. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to claims and litigation pertaining to intellectual property.\nBanking and other financial services companies, such as the Company, rely on technology companies to provide information technology products and services necessary to support their day-to-day operations. Technology companies frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, patent holding companies seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained. Competitors of the Company\u2019s vendors, or other individuals or companies, have from time to time claimed to hold intellectual property sold to the Company by its vendors. Such claims may increase in the future as the financial services sector becomes more reliant on information technology vendors. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.\nRegardless of the scope or validity of such patents or other intellectual property rights, or the merits of any claims by potential or actual litigants, the Company may have to engage in protracted litigation. Such litigation is often expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company\u2019s operations and distracting to management. If the Company were found to have infringed one or more patents or other intellectual property rights, it may be required to pay substantial damages or royalties to a third-party. In certain cases, the Company may consider entering into licensing agreements for disputed intellectual property, although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These licenses may also significantly increase the Company\u2019s operating expenses. If legal matters related to intellectual property claims were resolved against the Company or settled, the Company could be required to make payments in amounts that could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to claims and litigation pertaining to fiduciary responsibility.\nFrom time to time, customers make claims and take legal action pertaining to the Company\u2019s performance of its fiduciary responsibilities. Whether customer claims and legal action related to the Company\u2019s performance of its fiduciary responsibilities are founded or unfounded, if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to the Company, they may result in significant financial liability, adversely affect the market perception of the Company and its products and services and/or impact customer demand for those products and services. Any financial liability or reputation damage could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance Risks\nIncreasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from customers, regulators, investors, and other stakeholders with respect to the Company\u2019s environmental, social and governance practices may impose additional costs on the Company or expose it to new or additional risks.\nCompanies are facing increasing scrutiny from customers, regulators, investors, and other stakeholders related to their environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) practices and disclosure. Investor advocacy groups, investment funds and influential investors are also increasingly focused on these practices, especially as they relate to the environment, health and safety, diversity, labor conditions and human rights. Increased ESG related compliance costs could result in increases to the Company\u2019s overall operational costs. Failure to adapt to or comply with regulatory requirements or investor or stakeholder expectations and standards could negatively impact the Company\u2019s reputation, ability to do business with certain partners, and its stock price. New government\nregulations could also result in new or more stringent forms of ESG oversight and expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence, and disclosure.\nClimate change manifesting as physical or transitions risks could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations, business, and customers.\nConcerns over the long-term impacts of climate change have led and will continue to lead to governmental efforts around the world to mitigate those impacts. Consumers and businesses also may change their behavior on their own as a result of these concerns. The Company and its customers will need to respond to new laws and regulations as well as consumer and business preferences resulting from climate change concerns. The Company and its customers may face cost increases, asset value reductions, and operating process changes, among other impacts. The impact on the Company\u2019s customers will likely vary depending on their specific attributes, including reliance on or role in carbon intensive activities. In addition, the Company could face reductions in creditworthiness on the part of some customers or in the value of assets securing loans. The Company\u2019s efforts to take these risks into account in making lending and other decisions may not be effective in protecting the Company from the negative impact of new laws and regulations or changes in consumer or business behavior.\nCOVID-19 Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect the Company and its customers, associates and third-party service providers, and the adverse impacts on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, operations and prospects could be significant.\nThe spread of COVID-19 has created a global public health crisis that has resulted in unprecedented uncertainty, volatility and disruption in financial markets and in governmental, commercial and consumer activity in the United States and globally. Governmental responses to the pandemic have included orders closing businesses not deemed essential and directing individuals to restrict their movements and observe social distancing. These actions, together with responses to the pandemic by businesses and individuals, have resulted in decreases in commercial and consumer activity, temporary closures of many businesses that have led to loss of revenues and an increase in unemployment, material decreases in oil and gas prices and in business valuations, disrupted global supply chains, market downturns and volatility, changes in consumer behavior related to pandemic fears and an expectation that Federal Reserve policy will maintain a low interest rate environment for the foreseeable future. These changes have had a significant adverse effect on the markets in which the Company conducts its business and on the demand for its products and services.\nBusiness and consumer customers of the Company are experiencing varying degrees of financial distress, which is expected to continue to increase over coming months and could adversely affect their ability to timely pay interest and principal on their loans and the value of the collateral securing their obligations. Further, any disruption to the Company\u2019s ability to deliver financial products or services to, or interact with, its customers could result in losses or increased operational costs, regulatory fines, penalties and other sanctions, or harm the Company\u2019s reputation.\nCOVID-19 is not yet contained and could affect significantly more households and businesses. Given the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances, it is not possible to accurately predict the extent, severity or duration of these conditions or when normal economic and operating conditions will resume. For this reason, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic affects the Company\u2019s business, operations and financial condition, as well as its regulatory capital and liquidity, is highly uncertain and unpredictable and depends on, among other things, new information that may emerge concerning the scope, duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and other parties in response to the pandemic. If the pandemic is prolonged, the adverse impact on the markets in which the Company operates and on its business, operations and financial condition could deepen.\nThe Federal Reserve has taken various actions and the U.S. government has enacted several fiscal stimulus measures to counteract the economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and provide economic assistance to individual households and businesses, stabilize the markets and support economic growth. The success of these measures is unknown and they may not be sufficient to fully mitigate the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company faces an increased risk of litigation and governmental, regulatory and third-party scrutiny as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on market and economic conditions and actions governmental authorities take in response to those conditions. Furthermore, various governmental programs such as the PPP are complex and the Company\u2019s participation may lead to additional litigation and governmental, regulatory and third-party scrutiny, negative publicity and damage to the Company\u2019s reputation. For example, the Company\u2019s participation in the PPP as a lender may adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenue and results of operations depending on the timing and amount of forgiveness, if any, to which its borrowers will be entitled.\nRisks Associated with the Company\u2019s Common Stock\nThe Company\u2019s corporate organizational documents and the provisions of Texas law to which it is subject may delay or prevent a change in control of the Company that a shareholder may favor.\nThe Company\u2019s amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain various provisions which may delay, discourage or prevent an attempted acquisition or change of control of the Company. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na Board of Directors classified into three classes of directors with the directors of each class having staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022\na provision that any special meeting of the Company\u2019s shareholders may be called only by the chairman of the board and chief executive officer, the president, a majority of the Board of Directors or the holders of at least 50% of the Company\u2019s shares entitled to vote at the meeting; and\n\u2022\na provision establishing certain advance notice procedures for nomination of candidates for election as directors and for shareholder proposals to be considered at an annual or special meeting of shareholders.\nThe Company\u2019s articles of incorporation provide for noncumulative voting for directors and authorize the Board of Directors to issue shares of its preferred stock without shareholder approval and upon such terms as the Board of Directors may determine. The issuance of the Company\u2019s preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from acquiring, a controlling interest in the Company. In addition, certain provisions of Texas law, including a provision which restricts certain business combinations between a Texas corporation and certain affiliated shareholders, may delay, discourage or prevent an attempted acquisition or change in control of the Company.\nThere are restrictions on the Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends.\nHolders of the Company\u2019s common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as the Company\u2019s Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Although the Company has historically declared cash dividends on its common stock, it is not required to do so and there can be no assurance that the Company will pay dividends in the future. Any declaration and payment of dividends on common stock will depend upon the Company\u2019s earnings and financial condition, liquidity and capital requirements, the general economic and regulatory climate, the Company\u2019s ability to service any equity or debt obligations senior to the common stock and other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors.\nThe Company\u2019s principal source of funds to pay dividends on the shares of common stock is cash dividends that the Company receives from the Bank. Various banking laws applicable to the Bank limit the payment of dividends and other distributions by the Bank to the Company, and may therefore limit the Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends on its common stock.\nThere may be extreme fluctuations in the Company\u2019s stock price.\nThe trading price for the Company\u2019s common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors outside the Company\u2019s control, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of operations;\n\u2022\nrecommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet analysts\u2019 revenue or earnings estimates;\n\u2022\noperating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to the Company;\n\u2022\nnews reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the financial services industry;\n\u2022\nperceptions in the marketplace regarding the Company and/or its competitors;\n\u2022\nnew technology used, or services offered, by competitors;\n\u2022\ncybersecurity breaches;\n\u2022\nactions by institutional shareholders;\n\u2022\nsignificant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving the Company or its competitors;\n\u2022\nfailure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions;\n\u2022\nchanges in government regulations;\n\u2022\ngeopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts;\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions, including real or anticipated changes in the strength of the Texas and Oklahoma economies; and\n\u2022\nindustry factors and general economic and political conditions and events, such as economic slowdowns or recessions, interest rate changes, oil price volatility or credit losses.", "PERMNO": 86432, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "PB"}
