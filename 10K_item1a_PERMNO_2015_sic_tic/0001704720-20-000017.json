{"cik": "1704720", "company": "Cannae Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Relating to the Company's Structure\nWe may become subject to the Investment Company Act of 1940.\nWe do not believe that we are subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \"40 Act\"). We were formed for the purpose of effecting the Split-Off and for controlling, operating or holding, as applicable, the FNFV Group's business and investments, including the portfolio companies. We engage primarily in the business of managing and operating our controlled subsidiaries. Our officers and any employees who provide services to us pursuant to the terms of our corporate services agreement with FNF devote their activities to the businesses of these portfolio companies. Our interest in the portfolio companies comprises substantially all of our assets and substantially all of our income, if any, is derived from restaurant revenue from our Restaurant Group, the revenue of T-System, and dividends and other distributions made on our interests in portfolio companies. Based on these factors, we believe that we are not an investment company under the 40 Act, including under Section 3(b)(1) of the 40 Act. If, at any time, we become primarily engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities, we could become subject to regulation under the 40 Act. Following any such change in our business and after giving effect to any applicable grace periods, we may be required to register as an investment company, which could result in significant registration and compliance costs, could require changes to our corporate governance structure and financial reporting, and could restrict our activities going forward. In addition, if we were to become inadvertently subject to the 40 Act, any violation of the 40 Act could subject us to material adverse consequences, including potentially significant regulatory penalties and the possibility that certain of our contracts would be deemed unenforceable.\nRisks Relating to the Externalization and Our Manager\nThe Management Service Agreement was negotiated between related parties and the terms, including fees payable, may not be as favorable to us as if it were negotiated with an unaffiliated third party.\nBecause our Manager is owned by certain of our directors and executive officers, the Management Services Agreement was developed by related parties, although our independent directors reviewed and approved the Management Services Agreement. The terms of the Management Services Agreement, including fees payable, may not reflect the terms we may have received if it was negotiated with an unrelated third party. In addition, particularly as a result of our relationship with the principal owners of the Manager, who are certain directors and members of our management team, our independent directors may determine that it is in the best interests of our shareholders not to enforce, or to enforce less vigorously, our rights under the Management Services Agreement because of our desire to maintain our ongoing relationship with our Manager.\nOur executive officers, directors and Manager may allocate some of their time to other businesses, thereby causing conflicts of interest in their determination as to how much time to devote to our affairs, which may materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nWhile the members of our management team anticipate devoting a substantial amount of their time to the affairs of the Company, our executive officers, directors, Manager and other members of our management team may engage in other business activities. This may result in a conflict of interest in allocating their time between our operations and our management and the operations of other businesses. Their other business endeavors may involve related or unrelated parties. Conflicts of interest that arise over the allocation of time may not always be resolved in our favor and may materially adversely affect our results of operations. See the section entitled \u201cFactors Relating to the Split-Off\u201d included in Item 1A of our Annual Report for further discussion of risks associated with our split-off from, and relationship with, FNF.\nConflicts of interest could arise in connection with certain of our directors\u2019 and executive officers\u2019 discharge of fiduciary duties to our shareholders.\nCertain of our directors and executive officers are members or employees of the Manager. Such persons, by virtue of their positions with us, have fiduciary duties to us and our shareholders. The duties of such persons as directors or executive officers\nto us and our shareholders may conflict with the interests of such persons in their capacities as members or employees of the Manager.\nOur Manager and members of our management team may engage in activities that compete with us or our businesses.\nWhile the members of our management team intend to devote a substantial majority of their time to the affairs of the Company, and while our Manager currently does not manage any other businesses that are in lines of business similar to our businesses, neither our management team nor our Manager is expressly prohibited from investing in or managing other entities, including those that are in the same or similar line of business as our businesses, or required to present any particular investment or business opportunity to the Company. In this regard, the Management Services Agreement and the obligation thereunder to provide management services to us will not create a mutually exclusive relationship between our Manager, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other.\nWe cannot remove our Manager solely for poor performance, which could limit our ability to improve our performance and could adversely affect the market price of our shares.\nUnder the terms of the Management Services Agreement, our Manager may not be removed as a result of underperformance. Instead, the Company\u2019s board of directors may only remove our Manager in certain limited circumstances or upon a vote by 75% of the Company\u2019s board of directors and 75% of our shareholders to terminate the Management Services Agreement. This limitation could adversely affect the market price of our shares.\nOur Manager can resign on 180 days\u2019 notice, subject to a limited extension, and we may not be able to find a suitable replacement, resulting in a disruption in our operations that could materially adversely affect our financial condition, business and results of operations as well as the market price of our shares.\nOur Manager has the right, under the Management Services Agreement, to resign at any time on 180 days\u2019 written notice, whether we have found a replacement or not, subject to the Company\u2019s right to extend such period by an additional 180 days or until a replacement manager has been in place for 30 days, if no replacement manager has been found by the 150th day following the Manager\u2019s notice of resignation. If our Manager resigns, we may not be able to contract with a new manager or hire internal management with similar expertise and ability to provide the same or equivalent services on acceptable terms within 180 days (subject to possible extension), or at all, in which case our operations are likely to experience a disruption; our financial condition, business and results of operations as well as our ability to pay distributions are likely to be adversely affected; and the market price of our shares may decline. In addition, the coordination of our internal management, acquisition activities and supervision of our businesses is likely to suffer if we are unable to identify and reach an agreement with a single institution or group of executives having the expertise possessed by our Manager. Even if we are able to retain comparable management, whether internal or external, the integration of such management and their lack of familiarity with our businesses may result in additional costs and time delays that could materially adversely affect our financial condition, business and results of operations.\nWe must pay our Manager the management fee regardless of our performance.\nOur Manager is entitled to receive a management fee that is based on our cost of invested capital, as defined in the Management Services Agreement, regardless of the performance of our businesses. The calculation of the management fee is unrelated to the Company\u2019s results of operations. As a result, the management fee may incentivize our Manager to increase the amount of invested capital.\nWe cannot determine the amount of the management fee that will be paid over time with any certainty, nor are we able to determine with any certainty the amount of carried interest that will be paid over time, and our payment of such fees and carried interest to the Manager may significantly reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our shareholders.\nUnder the Management Services Agreement, the Company will be obligated to pay a management fee to and, subject to certain exceptions, reimburse the costs and out-of-pocket expenses of our Manager incurred on behalf of the Company in connection with the provision of services to the Company. The management fee is calculated by reference to the Company\u2019s cost of invested capital, which will be impacted by the acquisition or disposition of, and additional capital contributions and investments in, businesses, which can be significantly influenced by our Manager, as well as the performance of our businesses and other businesses we may acquire in the future. Changes in cost of invested capital and in the resulting management fee could be significant, resulting in a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations. In addition, if the performance of the Company declines, assuming cost of invested capital remains the same, management fees will increase as a percentage of the Company\u2019s net income.\nFurthermore, we cannot determine the amount of carried interest with respect to liquidity events involving investments of the Company that will be paid over time with any certainty. Such determination would be dependent on the potential sale proceeds received for any of our businesses and the performance of the Company and its businesses over a multi-year period of time, among other factors that cannot be predicted with certainty at this time. Such factors may have a significant impact on the amount of any carried interest to be paid to the Manager. Likewise, such determination would be dependent on whether certain hurdles were\nsurpassed giving rise to a payment of carried interest. Any amounts paid in respect of the carried interest are unrelated to the management fee earned for performance of services under the Management Services Agreement.\nWhile it is difficult to quantify with any certainty the actual amount of any such payments in the future, such amounts could be substantial. The management fee and carried interest will be payment obligations of the Company and, as a result, will be paid, along with other Company obligations, prior to the payment of distributions to shareholders. As a result the payment of these amounts may significantly reduce the amount of cash flow available for distribution to our shareholders. If we do not have sufficient liquid assets to pay the management fee and carried interest when such payments are due, we may be required to liquidate assets or incur debt in order to make such payments. This circumstance could materially adversely affect our liquidity and ability to make distributions to our shareholders.\nOur profit allocation may induce our Manager to make suboptimal decisions regarding our operations.\nOur Manager will receive carried interest based on profits in excess of an annualized hurdle rate upon a liquidity event involving a Company investment. In this respect, a calculation and payment of carried interest may be triggered upon the sale of one of our businesses. As a result, our Manager may be incentivized to recommend the sale of one or more of our businesses to our Board of Directors at a time that may not be optimal for our shareholders.\nRisks Relating to the Restaurant Group\nGeneral macroeconomic factors, including unemployment, energy prices and interest rates, and certain economic and business factors specific to the restaurant and bakery industries that are largely out of our restaurant businesses' control may materially and adversely affect consumer behavior and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGeneral economic conditions may materially and adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of our restaurant businesses, which we also refer to as our Restaurant Group companies. Recessionary economic cycles, a protracted economic slowdown, a worsening economy, increased unemployment, increased energy prices, rising interest rates, a downgrade of the United States (\"U.S.\") government's long-term credit rating, financial market volatility and unpredictability or other national, regional and local regulatory and economic conditions or other industry-wide cost pressures could affect consumer behavior and spending for restaurant dining occasions and result in increased pressure with respect to our Restaurant Group companies' pricing, guest count levels and commodity costs, which could lead to a further decline in our Restaurant Group companies' sales and earnings, beyond those that resulted in the Blue Ribbon Reorganization. Job losses, foreclosures, bankruptcies and falling home prices could cause customers to make fewer discretionary purchases, and any significant decrease in our Restaurant Group companies' guest counts or profit will negatively impact their financial performance. In addition, if gasoline, natural gas, electricity and other energy costs increase, or credit card, home mortgage and other borrowing costs increase with rising interest rates, our Restaurant Group companies' customers may have lower disposable income and reduce the frequency with which they dine at restaurants, may spend less during each visit at our Restaurant Group companies' restaurants or may choose more inexpensive restaurants. These factors could also cause the Restaurant Group companies to, among other things, reduce the number and frequency of new restaurant openings, close additional restaurants, delay the reimaging of the Restaurant Group companies' existing restaurant locations, or impede our ability to successfully execute, and achieve the goals contemplated by, the Blue Ribbon Reorganization.\nFurthermore, we cannot predict the effects that actual or threatened armed conflicts, terrorist attacks, efforts to combat terrorism, including military action against any foreign state or local group located in a foreign state, heightened security requirements on local, regional, national or international economies or a failure to protect information systems for critical infrastructure, such as the electrical grid and telecommunications systems, could have on the Restaurant Group companies' operations, the economy or consumer confidence generally. Any of these events could affect consumer spending patterns or result in increased costs for the Restaurant Group companies due to security measures.\nThe business results of our Restaurant Group companies depend on a number of industry-specific factors as well, many of which are beyond the Restaurant Group companies' control. The full service dining sector of the restaurant industry is affected by seasonal fluctuation of sales volumes, consumer confidence, consumer spending patterns and consumer preferences, including changes in consumer tastes and dietary habits, and the level of consumer acceptance of our restaurant brands. The performance of individual restaurants may also be materially and adversely affected by factors applicable to those restaurants, such as demographic trends, severe weather, traffic patterns and the type, number and location of competing restaurants.\nUnfavorable changes in the above factors or in other business and economic conditions affecting our Restaurant Group companies' customers or industry could increase costs, reduce guest counts in some or all restaurants or impose practical limits on pricing, any of which could lower profit margins and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Restaurant Group companies face significant competition for customers, real estate and employees and competitive pressure to adapt to changes in conditions driving customer demand. The Restaurant Group companies' inability to compete effectively may affect guest counts, sales and profit margins, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe restaurant industry is intensely competitive with a substantial number of restaurant operators that compete directly and indirectly with the Restaurant Group companies with respect to price, service, ambiance, brand, customer service, dining experience, location, food quality and variety and value perception of menu items and there are other well established competitors with substantially greater financial and other resources than the Restaurant Group companies. Some of our Restaurant Group companies' competitors advertise on national television, which may provide customers with greater awareness and name recognition than our Restaurant Group companies can achieve through their advertising efforts. There is also active competition for management personnel and attractive suitable real estate sites. Consumer tastes and perceptions, nutritional and dietary trends, guest count patterns and the type, number and location of competing restaurants often affect the restaurant business, and our Restaurant Group companies' competitors may react more efficiently and effectively to those conditions. For instance, prevailing health or dietary preferences or perceptions of our Restaurant Group companies' products may cause consumers to avoid certain menu items or products our Restaurant Group companies offer in favor of foods that are perceived as more healthy, and such choices by consumers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, our Restaurant Group companies face growing competition from the supermarket industry, with the improvement of their \"convenient meals\" in the deli and prepared food sections, from quick service and fast casual restaurants and online food delivery services as a result of food and beverage offerings by those food providers. As our Restaurant Group companies' competitors expand operations in markets where our restaurant businesses operate or expect to operate, we expect competition to intensify. If our Restaurant Group companies are unable to continue to compete effectively, including following the completion of the Blue Ribbon Reorganization, their guest counts, sales and profit margins could decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nHistorically, customer spending patterns for the Restaurant Group companies' restaurants are generally highest in the fourth quarter of the year and lowest in the third quarter of the year. Sales activity during the holidays may affect seasonal sales volumes in some of the markets in which our restaurant businesses operate. The quarterly results of our Restaurant Group companies have been and will continue to be affected by the timing of new restaurant openings and their associated costs (which are often materially greater during the first several months of operation than thereafter), restaurant closures and exit-related costs, labor availability and costs for hourly and management personnel, profitability of restaurants, especially in new markets, trends in comparable restaurant sales, changes in borrowings and interest rates, changes in consumer preferences and competitive conditions, fluctuations in food and commodity prices, fluctuations in costs attributable to public company compliance and impairments of goodwill, intangible assets and property, fixtures and equipment. As a result of these and other factors, the Restaurant Group companies' financial results for any quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year.\nIf our restaurant businesses are unable to effectively grow revenue and profitability at certain of their locations, our Restaurant Group companies may be required to record additional impairment charges to their restaurant assets, the carrying value of their goodwill or other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Restaurant Group companies assess the potential impairment of their long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or asset group may not be recoverable. Factors considered include, but are not limited to, significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner in which an asset is being used, an expectation that an asset will be disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life and significant negative industry or economic trends. Our Restaurant Group companies annually review and compare the carrying value of intangible assets, including goodwill, to the fair value. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recorded $10.4 million and $26.7 million, respectively, of impairment to goodwill in our Restaurant Group segment as a result of deteriorating operating results and cash flow resulting from declining same store sales and increased costs. In addition, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we recorded $17.1 million, $5.8 million and $2.9 million, respectively, of impairment expense related to other intangible assets within our Restaurant Group.\nWe cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any future recorded impairment to our Restaurant Group companies' assets. Should the value of goodwill or other intangible or long-lived assets become further impaired, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreased commodity, energy and other costs could decrease our Restaurant Group companies' profit margins or cause the Restaurant Group companies to limit or otherwise modify their menus, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe cost, availability and quality of ingredients restaurant operations use to prepare their food is subject to a range of factors, many of which are beyond their control. A significant component of our restaurant businesses' costs will be related to food\ncommodities, including beef, pork, chicken, seafood, poultry, dairy products, oils, produce, fruit, flour and other related costs such as energy and transportation over which we may have little control, which can be subject to significant price fluctuations due to seasonal shifts, climate conditions, industry demand, changes in international commodity markets and other factors. If there is a substantial increase in prices for these commodities, our Restaurant Group companies' results of operations may be negatively affected. In addition, the Restaurant Group companies' restaurants are dependent upon frequent deliveries of perishable food products that meet certain specifications. Shortages or interruptions in the supply of perishable food products caused by unanticipated demand, problems in production or distribution, disease or food-borne illnesses, inclement weather or other conditions could adversely affect the availability, quality, and cost of ingredients, which would likely lower revenues, damage the Restaurant Group companies' reputation or otherwise harm our business.\nThe Restaurant Group companies are also subject to the general risks of inflation. The performance of our Restaurant Group companies' business is also adversely affected by increases in the price of utilities, such as natural gas, whether as a result of inflation, shortages or interruptions in supply, or otherwise. The Restaurant Group companies' business will also incur significant costs for insurance, labor, marketing, taxes, real estate, borrowing and litigation, all of which could increase due to inflation, changes in laws and regulations, competition or other events beyond the Restaurant Group companies' control.\nNegative customer experiences or negative publicity surrounding our Restaurant Group companies' restaurants or other restaurants could adversely affect sales in one or more of our Restaurant Group companies' restaurants and make our concepts less valuable, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause we believe our Restaurant Group companies' success depends significantly on their ability to provide exceptional food quality, outstanding service and an excellent overall dining experience, adverse publicity, whether or not accurate, relating to food quality, public health concerns, illness, safety, injury or government or industry findings concerning our Restaurant Group companies' restaurants, restaurants operated by other food service providers or others across the food industry supply chain could affect our Restaurant Group companies more than it would other restaurants that compete primarily on price or other factors. If customers perceive or experience a reduction in the food quality, service or ambiance at our Restaurant Group companies' restaurants or in any way believe our Restaurant Group companies' restaurants have failed to deliver a consistently positive experience, the value and popularity of one or more of our Restaurant Group companies' concepts could suffer. Further, because our restaurant businesses rely heavily on \"word-of-mouth,\" as opposed to more conventional mediums of advertisement, to establish concept recognition, our restaurant businesses may be more adversely affected by negative customer experiences than other dining establishments, including those of our restaurant businesses' competitors.\nOur restaurant businesses could suffer due to reduced demand for our restaurant businesses' brands or specific menu offerings if our restaurant businesses are the subject of negative publicity or litigation regarding allegations of food-related contaminations or illnesses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFood safety is a top priority, and our Restaurant Group companies dedicate substantial resources to ensuring that their customers enjoy safe, quality food products. Food-related contaminations and illnesses may be caused by a variety of food-borne pathogens, such as e-coli or salmonella, which are frequently carried on unwashed fruits and vegetables, from a variety of illnesses transmitted by restaurant workers, such as hepatitis A, which may not be diagnosed prior to being infectious, and from contamination of food by foreign substances. Contamination and food borne illness incidents could also be caused at the point of source or by food suppliers and distributors. As a result, we cannot control all of the potential sources of contamination or illness that can be contained in or transmitted from our Restaurant Group companies' food. Regardless of the source or cause, any report of food-borne illnesses or other food safety issues including food tampering or contamination, at one of our Restaurant Group companies' restaurants could adversely affect the reputation of our Restaurant Group companies' brands and have a negative impact on their sales. Even instances of food-borne illness, food tampering or food contamination occurring solely at restaurants of our Restaurant Group companies' competitors or at one of our Restaurant Group companies' suppliers could result in negative publicity about the food service industry generally and adversely impact our Restaurant Group companies' sales.\nIf any person becomes injured or ill, or alleges becoming injured or ill, as a result of eating our Restaurant Group companies' food, our Restaurant Group companies may temporarily close some restaurants or their bakery facilities, which would decrease their revenues, and our restaurant businesses may be liable for damages or be subject to governmental regulatory action, either of which could have long-lasting, negative effects on our restaurant businesses' reputation, financial condition and results of operations, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether our restaurant businesses are found liable. The occurrence of food-borne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients, resulting in higher costs and lower margins.\nOur Restaurant Group companies' failure to comply with government regulation, and the costs of compliance or non-compliance, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Restaurant Group companies are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting their business. Each of their restaurants and their bakery division are subject to licensing and regulation by a number of federal, state and local\ngovernmental authorities, which may include, among others, alcoholic beverage control, health and safety, nutritional menu labeling, health care, environmental and fire agencies. Difficulty in obtaining or failure to obtain the required licenses, including liquor or other licenses, permits or approval could delay or prevent the development of a new restaurant in a particular area. Additionally, difficulties or inabilities to retain or renew licenses, or increased compliance costs due to changed regulations, could adversely affect operations at existing restaurants.\nWhile only approximately 9% of the Restaurant Group companies' consolidated restaurant sales in 2019 were attributable to the sale of alcoholic beverages, approximately 19% of the restaurant sales at Ninety Nine were attributable to the sale of alcoholic beverages in 2019. Alcoholic beverage control regulations require each restaurant to apply to a state authority and, in certain locations, county or municipal authorities for a license or permit to sell alcoholic beverages on the premises and to provide service for extended hours and on Sundays. Typically, licenses must be renewed annually and may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time. Alcoholic beverage control regulations relate to numerous aspects of daily operations of the Restaurant Group companies' restaurants, including minimum ages of patrons and employees, hours of operation, advertising, training, wholesale purchasing, inventory control and the handling, storage and dispensation of alcoholic beverages. The failure of a restaurant to obtain or retain liquor or food service licenses would adversely affect the restaurant's operations.\nThere is also a potential for increased regulation of certain food establishments in the U.S., where compliance with Hazard Analysis & Critical Control Points (\"HACCP\") management systems may now be required. HACCP refers to a management system in which food safety is addressed through the analysis and control of potential hazards from raw material production, procurement and handling, to manufacturing, distribution and consumption of the finished product. Many states have required restaurants to develop and implement HACCP programs and the U.S. government continues to expand the sectors of the food industry that must adopt and implement HACCP programs. For example, the Food Safety Modernization Act, signed into law in January 2011, granted the FDA new authority regarding the safety of the entire food system, including through increased inspections and mandatory food recalls. We anticipate that the new requirements may impact the restaurant industry. Additionally, our Restaurant Group companies' suppliers may initiate or otherwise be subject to food recalls that may impact the availability of certain products, result in adverse publicity or require the Restaurant Group companies' to take actions that could be costly for them or otherwise harm their business.\nThe Restaurant Group companies are subject to laws and regulations relating to information security, privacy, cashless payments, gift cards and consumer credit, protection and fraud, and any failure or perceived or alleged failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm their reputation or lead to litigation, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe impact of current laws and regulations, the effect of future changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or future laws and regulations, or an insufficient or ineffective response to significant regulatory or public policy issues, could increase our Restaurant Group companies' cost structure or lessen their operational efficiencies and talent availability, and therefore have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal, state and local authorities could result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal liability. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase the Restaurant Group companies' exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings.\nRestaurant companies, including our restaurant companies, are the target of claims and lawsuits from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Proceedings of this nature, if successful, could result in our payment of substantial costs and damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Restaurant Group companies and other restaurant companies have been subject to claims and lawsuits alleging various matters from time to time in the ordinary course of business, including those that follow. Claims and lawsuits may include class action lawsuits, alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding workplace and employment matters, discrimination and similar matters. A number of these lawsuits have resulted in the payment of substantial damages by the defendants. Similar lawsuits have been instituted from time to time alleging violations of various federal and state wage and hour laws regarding, among other things, employee meal deductions, the sharing of tips amongst certain employees, overtime eligibility of assistant managers and failure to pay for all hours worked. Although our restaurant businesses will maintain what we believe to be adequate levels of insurance, insurance may not be available at all or in sufficient amounts to cover any liabilities with respect to these matters. Accordingly, if our restaurant businesses are required to pay substantial damages and expenses as a result of these types or other lawsuits, such payments or expenses could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOccasionally, our Restaurant Group companies' customers may file complaints or lawsuits against the Restaurant Group companies alleging that they are responsible for some illness or injury the customers suffered at or after a visit to one of the Restaurant Group companies' restaurants, including actions seeking damages resulting from food-borne illness and relating to notices with respect to chemicals contained in food products required under state law. Our Restaurant Group companies may also be subject to a variety of other claims from third parties arising in the ordinary course of their business, including personal injury\nclaims, contract claims and claims alleging violations of federal and state laws. In addition, most of our Restaurant Group companies' restaurants are subject to state \"dram shop\" or similar laws which generally allow a person to sue our restaurant businesses if that person was injured by a legally intoxicated person who was wrongfully served alcoholic beverages at one of our Restaurant Group companies' restaurants. The restaurant industry has also been subject to a growing number of claims that the menus and actions of restaurant chains have led to the obesity of certain of their customers. In addition, the Restaurant Group companies may also be subject to lawsuits from their employees or others alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding workplace and employment matters, discrimination and similar matters. A number of these lawsuits in the restaurant industry have resulted in the payment of substantial damages by the defendants.\nAdditionally, certain of the Restaurant Group companies' tax returns and employment practices are subject to audits by the IRS and various state tax authorities. Such audits could result in disputes regarding tax matters that could lead to litigation that would be costly to defend or could result in the payment of additional taxes, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRegardless of whether any claims against the Restaurant Group companies are valid or whether they are liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert resources away from their operations. In addition, such claims may generate negative publicity, which could reduce customer traffic and sales. Although our restaurant businesses will maintain what they believe to be adequate levels of insurance, insurance may not be available at all or in sufficient amounts to cover any liabilities with respect to these or other matters. Defense costs, even for unfounded claims, or a judgment or other liability in excess of our restaurant businesses' insurance coverage for any claims or any adverse publicity resulting from claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Restaurant Group companies rely heavily on information technology and any material failure, interruption, or security breach in their systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Restaurant Group companies rely heavily on information technology systems across their operations and corporate functions, including for order and delivery from suppliers and distributors, point-of-sale processing in their restaurants, management of their supply chains, payment of obligations, collection of cash, bakery production, data warehousing to support analytics, finance or accounting systems, labor optimization tools, gift cards, online business and various other processes and transactions, including the storage of employee and customer information. The Restaurant Group companies' ability to effectively manage their business and coordinate the production, distribution and sale of their products will depend significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems. In 2015, the Restaurant Group companies upgraded their information systems using a third-party provider. However, the failure of these systems to operate effectively, maintenance problems or problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems could cause delays in product sales and reduced efficiency of our restaurant businesses' operations, and significant capital investments could be required to remediate the problem.\nThe regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements. Compliance with these requirements may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes and the development of new administrative processes. In addition, customers and employees have a high expectation that our restaurant businesses will adequately protect their personal information. The majority of our restaurant businesses' restaurant sales are by credit or debit cards. We and other restaurants and retailers have experienced security breaches in which credit and debit card information of their customers has been stolen.\nIn addition, any breach in customer payment information could result in investigations by the U.S. Secret Service Electronic Crimes Task Force (\"ECTF\") and increased cost in our restaurant businesses' efforts to cooperate with the ECTF.\nThe Restaurant Group companies also maintain certain personal information regarding their employees. In addition to government investigations, the Restaurant Group companies may in the future become subject to lawsuits or other proceedings for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of their customers' credit or debit card information or if customer or employee information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately. If the Restaurant Group companies fail to comply with these laws and regulations or experience a significant breach of customer, employee or company data, their reputation could be damaged and they could experience lost sales, fines or lawsuits. Additionally, if a person is able to circumvent the security measures intended to protect our Restaurant Group companies' employee or customer private data, he or she could destroy or steal valuable information and disrupt our restaurant businesses' operations. The Restaurant Group companies may also be required to incur additional costs to modify or enhance their systems in order to prevent or remediate any such attacks.\nThe success of the Restaurant Group depends, in part, on its intellectual property, which we may be unable to protect.\nWe regard our Restaurant Group's service marks, including \"O'Charley's\", \"Ninety Nine\", \"Village Inn\", \"Legendary Baking\", and \"Bakers Square\", and other service marks and trademarks as important factors in the marketing of our restaurants. We have also obtained trademarks for several of our brand's menu items and for various advertising slogans. We are aware of names and marks similar to our Restaurant Group's service marks and trademarks used by other persons in certain geographic areas where\nwe have restaurants. We believe such uses will not adversely affect us and our policy is to pursue registration of our marks whenever possible and to oppose vigorously any infringement of our marks.\nWe license the use of our registered trademarks and service marks to franchisees and third parties through franchise arrangements and licenses. The franchise and license arrangements restrict franchisees' and licensees' activities with respect to the use of our trademarks and service marks, and impose quality control standards in connection with goods and services offered in connection with the trademarks and service marks.\nOccasionally, third parties may assert that we are, or may be, infringing on or misappropriating their intellectual property rights. In these cases, we intend to defend against claims or negotiate licenses when we consider these actions appropriate. Intellectual property cases are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. If we become involved in this type of litigation, it could consume significant resources and divert our attention from business operations.\nIf we are found to infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, we could incur significant damages, be enjoined from continuing to use certain marks, or be required to obtain a license to continue using the affected marketing and promotional materials. A license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all. Similarly, changing our marketing plan to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly or impracticable.\nWe are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with the Blue Ribbon Reorganization\nOn January 27, 2020, Blue Ribbon, which owns the Village Inn, Bakers Square and Legendary Baking concepts, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the \"Blue Ribbon Reorganization\"). Blue Ribbon is subject to risks and uncertainties associated with the Blue Ribbon Reorganization, including but not limited to (i) its ability to maintain relationships with its suppliers, service providers, customers, employees and other third parties, (ii) the ability of third parties to seek and obtain court approval to terminate contracts and other agreements with Blue Ribbon, (iii) the actions and decisions of Blue Ribbons' creditors and other third parties who have interests in the Blue Ribbon Reorganization that may be inconsistent with our plans, (iv) limitations on Blue Ribbons operating flexibility during the proceedings and (v) our ability to compromise certain claims through the Blue Ribbon Reorganization. While we do not expect the Blue Ribbon Reorganization to have a material adverse effect on the Company, adverse changes in facts and circumstances as the Blue Ribbon Reorganization progresses could change that assertion and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to the Company's Investment in Ceridian\nAn information security breach of Ceridian's systems or the loss of, or unauthorized access to, customer information, failure to comply with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission\u2019s (\u201cFTC\u201d) ongoing consent order regarding data protection, or a system disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business, market brand, financial condition, and results of operations.\nCeridian's business is dependent on its payroll, transaction, financial, accounting, and other data processing systems. Ceridian relies on these systems to process, on a daily and time sensitive basis, a large number of complicated transactions. Ceridian electronically receives, processes, stores, and transmits data and personally identifiable information (\u201cPII\u201d) about its customers and their employees, as well as its vendors and other business partners, including names, social security numbers, and checking account numbers. Ceridian keeps this information confidential. However, Ceridian's websites, networks, applications and technologies, and other information systems may be targeted for sabotage, disruption, or data misappropriation. The uninterrupted operation of Ceridian's information systems and Ceridian's ability to maintain the confidentiality of PII and other customer and individual information that resides on its systems are critical to the successful operation of Ceridian's business. While Ceridian has information security and business continuity programs, these plans may not be sufficient to ensure the uninterrupted operation of its systems or to prevent unauthorized access to the systems by unauthorized third parties. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target, Ceridian may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. These concerns about information security are increased with the mounting sophistication of social engineering. Ceridian's network security hardening may be bypassed by phishing and other social engineering techniques that seek to use end user behaviors to distribute computer viruses and malware into its systems, which might disrupt Ceridian's delivery of services and make them unavailable, and might also result in the disclosure or misappropriation of PII or other confidential or sensitive information. In addition, a significant cyber security breach could prevent or delay Ceridian's ability to process payment transactions.\nAny information security breach in Ceridian's business processes or of its processing systems has the potential to impact its customer information and its financial reporting capabilities, which could result in the potential loss of business and Ceridian's ability to accurately report financial results. If any of these systems fail to operate properly or become disabled even for a brief period of time, Ceridian could potentially miss a critical filing period, resulting in potential fees and penalties, or lose control of customer data, all of which could result in financial loss, a disruption of Ceridian's businesses, liability to customers, regulatory intervention, or damage to its reputation. The continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. If Ceridian's security measures are breached as a result of third party\naction, employee or subcontractor error, malfeasance or otherwise, and, as a result, someone obtains unauthorized access to customer data, Ceridian's reputation may be damaged, its business may suffer, and Ceridian could incur significant liability. Ceridian may also experience security breaches that may remain undetected for an extended period of time. Techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and are growing increasingly sophisticated. As a result, Ceridian may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.\nThis environment demands that Ceridian continuously improve its design and coordination of security controls throughout the company. Despite these efforts, it is possible that Ceridian's security controls over data, training, and other practices it follows may not prevent the improper disclosure of PII or other confidential information. Any issue of data privacy as it relates to unauthorized access to or loss of customer and/or employee information could result in the potential loss of business, damage to Ceridian's market reputation, litigation, and regulatory investigation and penalties. Maintaining, updating, monitoring, and revising an information security program in an effort to ensure that it remains reasonable and appropriate in light of changes in security threats, changes in technology, and security vulnerabilities that arise from legacy systems is time-consuming and complex, and is an ongoing effort.\nThere may be other such security vulnerabilities that come to Ceridian's attention. The independent third party that reviews Ceridian's security program pursuant to the FTC consent order may determine that the existence of vulnerabilities in its security controls or the failure to remedy them in a timeframe they deem appropriate means that its security program does not provide a reasonable level of assurance that the security, confidentiality, and integrity of PII is protected by Ceridian (or that there was a failure to protect at some point in the reporting period). While Ceridian has taken and continues to take steps to ensure compliance with the consent order, if they are determined not to be in compliance with the consent order, or if any new breaches of security occur, the FTC may take enforcement actions or other parties may initiate a lawsuit. Any such resulting fines and penalties could have a material adverse effect on Ceridian's liquidity and financial results, and any reputational damage therefrom could adversely affect Ceridian's relationships with its existing customers and its ability to attain new customers. Ceridian's continued investment in the security of its technology systems, continued efforts to improve the controls within its technology systems, business processes improvements and the enhancements to its culture of information security may not successfully prevent attempts to breach Ceridian's security or unauthorized access to PII or other confidential, sensitive or proprietary information. In addition, in the event of a catastrophic occurrence, either natural or man-made, Ceridian's ability to protect its infrastructure, including PII and other customer data, and to maintain ongoing operations could be significantly impaired. Ceridian's business continuity and disaster recovery plans and strategies may not be successful in mitigating the effects of a catastrophic occurrence. Insurance may be inadequate or may not be available in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, Ceridian's insurance policies may not cover all claims made against them, and defending a suit, regardless of its merit, could be costly and divert management\u2019s attention. If Ceridian's security is breached, if PII or other confidential information is accessed, if Ceridian fails to comply with the consent order or if Ceridian experiences a catastrophic occurrence, it could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations, and ultimately the value of our investment in Ceridian.\nCeridian's solutions and business are subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws and regulations, including those regarding privacy, data protection, and information security. Any failure by Ceridian or its third party service providers, as well as the failure of its platform or services, to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nCeridian is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws and regulations, including regulation by various federal government agencies, including the FTC, and state and local agencies. The United States and various state and foreign governments have adopted or proposed limitations on, or requirements regarding, the collection, distribution, use, security, and storage of PII of individuals; and the FTC and many state attorneys general are applying federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards on the online collection, use and dissemination of data. Self-regulatory obligations, other industry standards, policies, and other legal obligations may apply to Ceridian's collection, distribution, use, security, or storage of PII or other data relating to individuals. In addition, most states and some foreign governments have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving certain types of PII. These obligations may be interpreted and applied in an inconsistent manner from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with one another, other regulatory requirements, or Ceridian's internal practices. Any failure or perceived failure by Ceridian to comply with U.S., E.U., or other foreign privacy or security laws, regulations, policies, industry standards, or legal obligations, or any security incident that results in the unauthorized access to, or acquisition, release, or transfer of, PII may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties, or adverse publicity and could cause Ceridian's customers to lose trust in it, which could harm its reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations, and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection and information security in the United States, Canada, the European Union, and other jurisdictions, and we cannot yet determine the impact such future laws, regulations, and standards may have on Ceridian's business. For example, in May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation came into force, bringing with it a complete overhaul of E.U. data protection laws: the new rules supersede E.U. data protection legislation, impose more stringent E.U. data protection requirements, and provide for\ngreater penalties for non-compliance. Changing definitions of what constitutes PII may also limit or inhibit Ceridian's ability to operate or to expand its business, including limiting strategic partnerships that may involve the sharing of data. Also, some jurisdictions require that certain types of data be retained on servers within these jurisdictions. Ceridian's failure to comply with applicable laws, directives, and regulations may result in enforcement action against it, including fines and imprisonment, and damage to Ceridian's reputation, any of which may have an adverse effect on its business and operating results. Further, in October 2015, the European Court of Justice issued a ruling invalidating the U.S.-E.U. Safe Harbor Framework, which facilitated transfers of PII to the United States in compliance with applicable E.U. data protection laws. In July 2016, the E.U. and the U.S. political authorities adopted the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield, replacing the Safe Harbor Framework and providing a new mechanism for companies to transfer E.U. PII to the United States. U.S. organizations wishing to self-certify under the Privacy Shield must pledge their compliance with its seven core and sixteen supplemental principles, which are based on European Data Protection Law.\nIf Ceridian's service is perceived to cause, or is otherwise unfavorably associated with, violations of privacy or data security requirements, it may subject it or its customers to public criticism and potential legal liability. Public concerns regarding PII processing, privacy and security may cause some of its customers\u2019 end users to be less likely to visit their websites or otherwise interact with them. If enough end users choose not to visit Ceridian's customers\u2019 websites or otherwise interact with them, Ceridian's customers could stop using its platform. This, in turn, may reduce the value of its services and slow or eliminate the growth of its business. Existing and potential privacy laws and regulations concerning privacy and data security and increasing sensitivity of consumers to unauthorized processing of PII may create negative public reactions to technologies, products, and services such as Ceridian's.\nEvolving and changing definitions of what constitutes PII and / or \u201cPersonal Data\u201d within the United States, Canada, the European Union, and elsewhere, especially relating to the classification of internet protocol, or IP addresses, machine or device identification numbers, location data and other information, may limit or inhibit Ceridian's ability to operate or to expand its business. Future laws, regulations, standards and other obligations could impair Ceridian's ability to collect or to use information that it utilizes to provide email delivery and marketing services to its customers, thereby impairing its ability to maintain and to grow its customer base and to increase revenue. Future restrictions on the collection, use, sharing, or disclosure of our customers\u2019 data or additional requirements for express or implied consent of customers for the use and disclosure of such information may limit our ability to develop new services and features.\nPrivacy concerns and laws or other domestic or foreign data protection regulations may reduce the effectiveness of Ceridian's applications, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nCeridian's customers can use its applications to collect, to use, and to store PII regarding their employees, independent contractors, and job applicants. Federal, state, and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted, are considering adopting, or may adopt laws and regulations regarding the collection, use, storage and disclosure of PII obtained from individuals. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such laws and regulations that are applicable to the businesses of Ceridian's customers, or to its business directly, may limit the use and adoption of Ceridian's applications and reduce overall demand, or lead to significant fines, penalties, or liabilities for any non-compliance with such privacy laws. Furthermore, privacy concerns may cause Ceridian's customers\u2019 workers to resist providing PII necessary to allow its customers to use its applications effectively. Even the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of Ceridian's applications in certain industries.\nAll of these domestic and international legislative and regulatory initiatives may adversely affect Ceridian's customers\u2019 ability to process, to handle, to store, to use, and to transmit demographic information and PII from their employees, independent contractors, job applicants, customers, and suppliers, which could reduce demand for Ceridian's applications. The European Union and many countries in Europe have stringent privacy laws and regulations, which may impact Ceridian's ability to profitably operate in certain European countries.\nFurther, international data protection regulations trending toward increased localized data residency rules make transfers from outside the regulation\u2019s jurisdiction increasingly complex and may impact Ceridian's ability to deliver solutions that meet all customers\u2019 needs. If the processing of PII were to be further curtailed in this manner, Ceridian's solutions could be less effective, which may reduce demand for our applications, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations, and ultimately the value of our investment in Ceridian.\nIn addition to government activity, privacy advocacy groups and the technology and other industries are considering various new, additional, or different self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on Ceridian. If the processing of PII were to be curtailed in this manner, Ceridian's solutions would be less effective, which may reduce demand for its applications, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations, and ultimately the value of our investment in Ceridian.\nLitigation and regulatory investigations aimed at Ceridian or resulting from actions of its predecessor may result in significant financial losses and harm to its reputation.\nCeridian faces risk of litigation, regulatory investigations, and similar actions in the ordinary course of its business, including the risk of lawsuits and other legal actions relating to breaches of contractual obligations or tortious claims from customers or other third parties, fines, penalties, interest, or other damages as a result of erroneous transactions, breach of data privacy laws, or lawsuits and legal actions related to Ceridian's predecessors. Any such action may include claims for substantial or unspecified compensatory damages, as well as civil, regulatory, or criminal proceedings against Ceridian's directors, officers, or employees; and the probability and amount of liability, if any, may remain unknown for significant periods of time. Ceridian may be also subject to various regulatory inquiries, such as information requests, and book and records examinations, from regulators and other authorities in the geographical markets in which Ceridian operates. A substantial liability arising from a lawsuit judgment or settlement or a significant regulatory action against Ceridian or a disruption in its business arising from adverse adjudications in proceedings against its directors, officers, or employees could have a material adverse effect on Ceridian's business, financial condition, and results or operations and ultimately the value of our investment in Ceridian.\nAdditionally, Ceridian is subject to claims and investigations as a result of its predecessor, Control Data Corporation (\u201cCDC\u201d), Ceridian Corporation, and other former entities for which Ceridian is successor-in-interest with respect to assumed liabilities. For example, in September 1989, CDC became party to an environmental matters agreement with Seagate Technology plc (\u201cSeagate\u201d) related to groundwater contamination on a parcel of real estate in Omaha, Nebraska sold by CDC to Seagate. In February 1988, CDC entered into an arrangement with Northern Engraving Corporation and the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency in relation to groundwater contamination at a site in Spring Grove, Minnesota. In August 2017, Ceridian received notice of a mesothelioma claim related to CDC. Although Ceridian is fully reserved for the groundwater contamination liabilities, Ceridian cannot at this time accurately assess the merits of these claims, and cannot be certain if additional liabilities related to such predecessor companies will surface. Moreover, even if Ceridian ultimately prevails in or settles any litigation, regulatory action, or investigation, Ceridian could suffer significant harm to its reputation, which could materially affect its ability to attract new customers, to retain current customers, and to recruit and to retain employees, which could have a material adverse effect on Ceridian's business, financial condition, and results of operations, and ultimately, the value of our investment in Ceridian.\nRisks Relating to the Company's Investment in Dun & Bradstreet\nOur investment in D&B may expose us to certain risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.\nD&B\u2019s transformation strategy is based on several strategic initiatives and growth strategies. The achievement of its strategic initiatives and growth strategies depends on a number of factors, including but not limited to its ability to maintain the integrity of its brand and reputation, client demand for its solutions, the effect of macro-economic challenges on its clients and vendors, its reliance on third parties to provide data and certain operational services and its ability to protect its information technology. D&B may not be able to successfully implement its strategic initiatives in accordance with its expectations, or in the timeframe it desires, which may result in us not realizing our expected return on our investment in D&B, or result in a negative return on investment.\nWe record our investment in D&B using the equity method of accounting, through which we record our proportionate share of their net earnings or loss in our consolidated financial statements. Equity-method investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable. If our equity-method investment is not recoverable, we may be required to record an impairment charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe share certain directors with D&B or its affiliated entities, which may lead to conflicting interests.\nOne of our directors, William P. Foley, II, and our CEO and director, Richard N. Massey, also serve on the boards of directors of D&B or its parent and subsidiaries. From time to time, we may enter into transactions with D&B and/or its respective subsidiaries or other affiliates. There can be no assurance that the terms of any such transactions will be as favorable to our company, D&B or any of our or its respective subsidiaries or affiliates as would be the case where there is no overlapping director.\nD&B's ability to implement and execute its strategic plans to transform the business may not be successful and, accordingly, D&B may not be successful in achieving its goals to transform its business, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nD&B may not be successful in developing and implementing its strategic plans to transform its businesses, including realigning management, simplifying and scaling technology, expanding and enhancing data and optimizing its client services. If the development or implementation of D&B's plans are not successful, they may not produce the revenue, margins, earnings or synergies that we expect, including offsetting the impact of adverse economic conditions that may exist currently or develop in the future. D&B may also face delays or difficulties in implementing technological, organizational and operational improvements, including its plans to leverage our data insights in new functional areas and utilize existing data architecture to generate high contribution incremental revenue streams, which could adversely affect its ability to successfully compete. In addition, the costs\nassociated with implementing such plans may be more than anticipated and D&B may not have sufficient financial resources to fund all of the desired or necessary investments required in connection with its plans. The existing and future execution of D&B's strategic and operating plans to transform its business will, to some extent, also be dependent on external factors that they cannot control. In addition, these strategic and operational plans need to be continually reassessed to meet the challenges and needs of its business in order for D&B to remain competitive. The failure to implement and execute its strategic and operating plans in a timely manner or at all, realize or maintain the cost savings or other benefits or improvements associated with such plans, have financial resources to fund the costs associated with such plans or incur costs in excess of anticipated amounts, or sufficiently assess and reassess these plans could have a material adverse effect on D&B's business, financial condition and results of operations, and ultimately the value of our investment in D&B.\nD&B's brand and reputation are key assets and a competitive advantage, and its business may be affected by how it is perceived in the marketplace.\nD&B's brand and reputation are key assets of its business and a competitive advantage. D&B's ability to attract and retain clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of its level of data quality, effective provision of solutions, business practices, including the actions of its employees, third-party providers, members of D&B's world-wide network of partners and other brand licensees, some of which may not be consistent with its policies and standards. Negative perception or publicity regarding these matters could damage D&B's reputation with clients and the public, which could make it difficult for it to attract and maintain clients. Adverse developments with respect to its industry may also, by association, negatively impact its reputation, or result in higher regulatory or legislative scrutiny. Negative perceptions or publicity could have a material adverse effect on D&B's business, financial condition and results of operations, and ultimately the value of our investment in D&B.\nData security and integrity are critically important to D&B's business, and cybersecurity incidents, including cyberattacks, breaches of security, unauthorized access to or disclosure of confidential information, business disruption, or the perception that confidential information is not secure, could result in a material loss of business, regulatory enforcement, substantial legal liability and/or significant harm to its reputation.\nD&B collects, stores and transmits a large amount of confidential company information on over 355 million total businesses as of December 31, 2019, including financial information and personal information. D&B operates in an environment of significant risk of cybersecurity incidents resulting from unintentional events or deliberate attacks by third parties or insiders, which may involve exploiting highly obscure security vulnerabilities or sophisticated attack methods. These cyberattacks can take many forms, but they typically have one or more of the following objectives, among others:\n\u2022\nobtain unauthorized access to confidential information;\n\u2022\nmanipulate or destroy data; or\n\u2022\ndisrupt, sabotage or degrade service on D&B's systems.\nD&B has experienced and expects to continue to experience numerous attempts to access its computer systems, software, networks, data and other technology assets on a daily basis. The security and protection of its data is a top priority for D&B. D&B devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade the wide array of physical, technical and contractual safeguards that it employs to provide security around the collection, storage, use, access and delivery of information D&B has in its possession. Despite D&B's physical security, implementation of technical controls and contractual precautions to identify, detect and prevent the unauthorized access to and alteration and disclosure of its data, D&B cannot be certain that third party systems that have access to its systems will not be compromised or disrupted in the future, whether as a result of criminal conduct or other advanced, employee error or malfeasance, or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures or natural disasters or other catastrophic events. Due to the sensitive nature of the information D&B collects, stores and transmits, it is not unusual for efforts to occur (coordinated or otherwise) by unauthorized persons to attempt to obtain access to its systems or data, or to inhibit D&B's ability to deliver products or services to a consumer or a business customer.\nD&B must continually monitor and develop its information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent, detect, address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact. The preventive actions D&B takes to address cybersecurity risk, including protection of its systems and networks, may be insufficient to repel or mitigate the effects of cyberattacks as it may not always be possible to anticipate, detect or recognize threats to its systems, or to implement effective preventive measures against all cybersecurity risks. This is because, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe techniques used in cyberattacks change frequently and may not be recognized until after the attacks have succeeded;\n\u2022\ncyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including sophisticated threat actors involved in organized crime, sponsored by nation-states, or linked to terrorist or hacktivist organizations; and\n\u2022\nthird parties may seek to gain access to our systems either directly or using equipment or security passwords belonging to employees, clients, third-party service providers or other users.\nAlthough D&B has not incurred material losses or liabilities to date as a result of any breaches, unauthorized disclosure, loss or corruption of its data or inability of its clients to access its systems, such events could disrupt D&B's operations, subject it to substantial regulatory and legal proceedings and potential liability and fines, result in a material loss of business and/or significantly harm its reputation.\nD&B may not be able to immediately address the consequences of a cybersecurity incident because a successful breach of its computer systems, software, networks or other technology assets could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected due to, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe breadth and complexity of its operations and the high volume of transactions that is processes;\n\u2022\nthe large number of clients, counterparties and third-party service providers with which D&B does business with;\n\u2022\nthe proliferation and increasing sophistication of cyberattacks; and\n\u2022\nthe possibility that a third party, after establishing a foothold on an internal network without being detected, might obtain access to other networks and systems.\nThe extent of a particular cybersecurity incident and the steps that D&B may need to take to investigate it may not be immediately clear, and it may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation can be completed and full and reliable information about the incident is known. While such an investigation is ongoing, D&B may not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated, any or all of which could further increase the costs and consequences of a cybersecurity incident.\nDue to concerns about data security and integrity, a growing number of legislative and regulatory bodies have adopted breach notification and other requirements in the event that information subject to such laws is accessed by unauthorized persons and additional regulations regarding the use, access, accuracy and security of such data are possible. In the United States, we are subject to laws that provide for at least 50 disparate notification regimes. Complying with such numerous and complex regulations in the event of unauthorized access would be expensive and difficult, and failure to comply with these regulations could subject D&B to regulatory scrutiny and additional liability.\nIf D&B is unable to protect its computer systems, software, networks, data and other technology assets it could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations, and ultimately the value of our investment in D&B.\nD&B's substantial indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and its ability to operate its business or react to changes in the economy or its industry, prevent them from fulfilling its obligations and could divert its cash flow from operations for debt payments.\nD&B has a substantial amount of indebtedness, which requires significant interest and principal payments. As of December 31, 2019, D&B has $3,818.9 million in total long-term debt outstanding, consisting of borrowings under its senior secured credit facilities (the \u2018\u2018New Senior Secured Credit Facilities\u2019\u2019), senior secured and unsecured notes (the \u2018\u2018New Notes\u2019\u2019) and its repatriation bridge facility (the \u2018\u2018New Repatriation Facility\u2019\u2019). In addition, subject to the limitations contained in the credit agreements governing D&B's New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the indentures governing its New Notes, D&B may be able to incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions or for other purposes. If D&B does so, the risks related to its high level of debt could increase. This substantial amount of indebtedness could have important consequences to D&B, including the following:\n\u2022\nit may be difficult for D&B to satisfy its obligations, including debt service requirements under its outstanding indebtedness;\n\u2022\nD&B's ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes may be impaired;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness, thereby reducing D&B's ability to use its cash flow to fund its operations, capital expenditures, future business opportunities and other purposes;\n\u2022\nD&B will be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse industry conditions and its flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in its business or industry will be more limited;\n\u2022\nD&B's ability to capitalize on business opportunities and to react to competitive pressures, as compared to its competitors, may be compromised due to its high level of indebtedness and the restrictive covenants in its credit agreements and indentures;\n\u2022\nD&B's ability to borrow additional funds or to refinance indebtedness may be limited; and\n\u2022\nit may cause potential or existing clients or vendors to not contract with D&B due to concerns over its ability to meet its financial obligations.\nRisks Relating to the Company's Corporate and Other Businesses\nCompetition and technology may erode the Corporate and Other business franchises and result in lower earnings, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEach of the Corporate and Other businesses face intense competitive pressures within markets in which they operate. While we will manage our businesses with the objective of achieving long-term sustainable growth by developing and strengthening competitive advantages, many factors, including market and technology changes, may erode or prevent the strengthening of competitive advantages. Accordingly, future operating results will depend to some degree on whether our Corporate and Other businesses are successful in protecting or enhancing their competitive advantages. If our Corporate and Other businesses are unsuccessful in these efforts, our periodic operating results in the future may decline from current levels.\nThe Corporate and Other businesses, from time to time in the ordinary course of business, are involved in legal proceedings and may experience unfavorable outcomes, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Corporate and Other businesses, from time to time in the ordinary course of business, are involved in pending and threatened litigation matters, some of which include claims for punitive or exemplary damages. These companies are also subject to compliance with extensive government laws and regulations related to employment practices and policies. The Corporate and Other businesses may not be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to their satisfaction, and these matters may involve claims for substantial amounts of money or for other relief that might necessitate changes to their business or operations. The defense of these actions may be both time consuming and expensive and their outcomes cannot be predicted with certainty. Determining reserves for pending litigation is a complex, fact-intensive process that requires significant legal judgment. It is possible that unfavorable outcomes in one or more such proceedings could result in substantial payments that could have a material adverse effect on the Corporate and Other businesses' cash flows in a particular period or on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to comply with, or changes in, laws or regulations applicable to the Corporate and Other businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Corporate and Other businesses will be subject to certain laws, such as certain environmental laws, takeover laws, anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, escheat or abandoned property laws, and antitrust laws, that may impose requirements on us and them as an affiliated group. As a result, we could become jointly and severally liable for all or part of fines imposed on our Corporate and Other businesses or be fined directly for violations committed by these businesses, and such fines imposed directly on us could be greater than those imposed on such businesses. Compliance with these laws or contracts could also require us to commit significant resources and capital towards information gathering and monitoring thereby increasing our operating costs.\nSimilarly, the Corporate and Other businesses may be subject to contractual obligations which may impose obligations or restrictions on their affiliates. The interpretation of such contractual provisions will depend on local laws. Given that we do not control all of the Corporate and Other businesses and that they generally operate independently of each other, there is a risk that we could contravene one or more of such laws, regulations and contractual arrangements due to limited access and opportunities to monitor compliance. In addition, compliance with these laws or contracts could require us to commit significant resources and capital towards information gathering and monitoring thereby increasing our operating costs.\nWe need qualified personnel to manage and operate our Corporate and Other businesses, and any inability to adequately satisfy these needs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn our decentralized business model, we need qualified and competent management to direct day-to-day business activities of our Corporate and Other businesses. Our Corporate and Other businesses also need qualified and competent personnel in executing their business plans and serving their customers, suppliers and other stakeholders. Changes in demographics, training requirements and the unavailability of qualified personnel could negatively impact our Corporate and Other businesses' ability to meet demands of customers to supply goods and services. Recruiting and retaining qualified personnel is important to all of our Corporate and Other businesses' operations. Although our Corporate and Other businesses have adequate personnel for the current business environment, unpredictable increases in demand for goods and services may exacerbate the risk of not having sufficient numbers of trained personnel, which could have a negative impact on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.\nRisks Relating to the Company's Investments\nOur management may seek growth through acquisitions in lines of business that will not necessarily be limited to our current areas of focus or geographic areas. This expansion of our business subjects us to associated risks, such as the diversion of management's attention and lack of experience in operating such businesses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may make acquisitions in lines of business that are not directly tied to or synergistic with our current portfolio companies. Accordingly, we may in the future acquire businesses in industries or geographic areas with which management is less familiar than we are with our current businesses.\nThe acquisition and integration of any business we may acquire involves a number of risks and may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures in assimilating or integrating the businesses, technologies, products, personnel or operations of the acquired business. Furthermore, acquisitions may:\n\u2022\ninvolve our entry into geographic or business markets in which we have little or no prior experience;\n\u2022\ninvolve difficulties in retaining the customers of the acquired business;\n\u2022\ninvolve difficulties and expense associated with regulatory requirements, competition controls or investigations;\n\u2022\nresult in a delay or reduction of sales for both us and the business we acquire; and\n\u2022\ndisrupt our ongoing business, divert our resources and require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our current business.\nTo complete future acquisitions, we may determine that it is necessary to use a substantial amount of our cash or engage in equity or debt financing. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. Any debt financing obtained by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters that make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital in the future and to pursue other business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. In addition, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all, which could limit our ability to engage in acquisitions. Moreover, we can make no assurances that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, such as operating improvements or anticipated cost savings, would be realized or that we would not be exposed to unexpected liabilities in connection with any acquisition.\nFurther, an acquisition may negatively affect our operating results because it may require us to incur charges and substantial debt or other liabilities, may cause adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation and amortization of deferred compensation charges, may require the amortization, write-down or impairment of amounts related to deferred compensation, goodwill and other intangible assets, may include substantial contingent consideration payments or other compensation that reduce our earnings during the quarter in which incurred, or may not generate sufficient financial return to offset acquisition costs.\nWe may often pursue investment opportunities that involve business, regulatory, legal or other complexities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs an element of our investment strategy, we may pursue unusually complex investment opportunities. This could often take the form of substantial business, regulatory or legal complexity. Our tolerance for complexity may present risks, as such transactions can be more difficult, expensive and time-consuming to finance and execute; it may be more difficult to manage or realize value from the assets acquired in such transactions; and such transactions may sometimes entail a higher level of regulatory scrutiny or a greater risk of contingent liabilities. Any of these risks could harm our performance.\nThe loss of key personnel could impair our operating abilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success will substantially depend on our ability to attract and retain key members of our senior management team and officers. If we lose one or more of these key employees, our operating results and in turn the value of our common stock could be materially adversely affected. Although we will have employment agreements with many of our officers, there can be no assurance that the entire term of the employment agreement will be served or that the employment agreement will be renewed upon expiration.\nThe due diligence process that we undertake in connection with new acquisitions may not reveal all facts that may be relevant in connection with an investment.\nBefore making acquisitions, we will conduct due diligence that we deem reasonable and appropriate based on the facts and circumstances applicable to each investment. When conducting due diligence, we may be required to evaluate important and complex business, financial, tax, accounting, environmental and legal issues. Outside consultants, legal advisers, accountants and investment banks may be involved in the due diligence process in varying degrees depending on the type of investment. Nevertheless, when conducting due diligence and making an assessment regarding an acquisition, we will rely on the resources\navailable to us, including information provided by the target of the investment and, in some circumstances, third party investigations. The due diligence investigation that we will carry out with respect to any opportunity may not reveal or highlight all relevant facts (including fraud) that may be necessary or helpful in evaluating such opportunity. Moreover, such an investigation will not necessarily result in the investment being successful.\nRisks Relating to the Split-Off\nWe may incur material costs as a result of our separation from FNF, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a result of our separation from FNF, we have incurred and will continue to incur costs and expenses not previously incurred. These increased costs and expenses may arise from various factors, including financial reporting or costs associated with complying with the federal securities laws (including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, tax administration and human resources related functions.) Although FNF will continue to provide many of these services for us at no-cost (other than reimbursement of FNF's out-of-pocket costs and expenses) under the corporate services agreement for up to three years following the Split-Off. The initial three-year term is set to expire in November 2020 and we are still evaluating our options for ongoing services currently provided by FNF. If the corporate services agreement is not mutually terminated by Cannae Holdings and FNF prior to the expiration of the initial three-year term, the corporate services agreement will automatically renew for successive one-year terms on mutually agreeable arm's length terms unless FNF and Cannae Holdings mutually agree to terminate the agreement. We cannot assure you that we will not incur third-party vendor costs or out-of-pocket expenses under the corporate services agreement that are material to our business. Moreover, we will have to develop internal departments/functions to perform the services at the end of the term of the corporate services agreement.\nWe share certain directors and officers with FNF, which may lead to conflicting interests.\nTwo of our executive officers, Richard L. Cox and Michael L. Gravelle, are also contracted to provide services or employed by FNF or FNF's subsidiaries and one of our directors, William P. Foley, II and one of our executive officers, Richard N. Massey, also serve on the boards of directors of FNF or its subsidiaries. Our executive officers and members of our board of directors have fiduciary duties to our stockholders. Likewise, any such persons who serve in similar capacities at FNF or any other public company have fiduciary duties to that company's stockholders. We also are party to a variety of related party agreements and relationships with FNF and certain of FNF's subsidiaries and FNF and subsidiaries of FNF have an ownership interest in Cannae Holdings. From time to time, we may enter into transactions with FNF and/or its respective subsidiaries or other affiliates. There can be no assurance that the terms of any such transactions will be as favorable to our company, FNF or any of our or its respective subsidiaries or affiliates as would be the case where there is no overlapping officer or director.\nOur agreements with FNF were negotiated while we were a subsidiary of FNF.\nWe have a number of inter-company agreements covering matters such as tax sharing and our responsibility for certain liabilities previously undertaken by FNF for certain of our businesses. In addition, we have entered into (i) a corporate services agreement with FNF, pursuant to which FNF provides to us certain \"back office\" services at no-cost (other than reimbursement of FNF's out-of-pocket costs and expenses), (ii) a voting agreement with FNF, pursuant to which FNF agrees to appear or cause all shares of Cannae Holdings common stock that FNF or its subsidiaries, as applicable, own after the Split-Off to be counted as present at any meeting of the stockholders of Cannae Holdings, for the purpose of establishing a quorum, and agrees to vote all of such Cannae Holdings shares (or cause them to be voted) in the same manner as, and in the same proportion to, all shares voted by holders of Cannae Holdings common stock (other than FNF and its subsidiaries), (iii) a registration rights agreement, pursuant to which FNF or its subsidiaries, as applicable, received registration rights with respect to the shares in Cannae held by FNF and (iv) a revolver note with FNF, pursuant to which Cannae Holdings may borrow revolving loans, the proceeds of which may be used for investment purposes and working capital needs, from FNF from time to time in an aggregate amount not to exceed $100.0 million. The terms of all of these agreements were established while we were a wholly-owned subsidiary of FNF, and hence may not be the result of arm's length negotiations. We believe that the terms of these inter-company agreements are commercially reasonable and fair to all parties under the circumstances; however, conflicts could arise in the interpretation or any extension or renegotiation of the foregoing agreements after the Split-Off.\nRisks Relating to the Company's Common Stock and the Securities Market\nOur charter, bylaws and provisions of Delaware law may discourage or prevent strategic transactions, including a takeover of our company, even if such a transaction would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nProvisions contained in our charter and bylaws and provisions of the Delaware General Corporate Law (\"DGCL\"), could delay or prevent a third party from entering into a strategic transaction with us, as applicable, even if such a transaction would benefit our stockholders. For example, our charter and bylaws:\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \"blank check\" preferred stock that could be issued by us upon approval of our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares of capital stock, making a takeover more difficult and expensive;\n\u2022\nprovide that directors may be removed from office only for cause and that any vacancy on our board of directors may only be filled by a majority of our directors then in office, which may make it difficult for other stockholders to reconstitute our board of directors;\n\u2022\nprovide that special meetings of the stockholders may be called only upon the request of a majority of our board of directors or by our executive chairman, chief executive officer or president, as applicable;\n\u2022\nrequire advance notice to be given by stockholders for any stockholder proposals or director nominees;\n\u2022\nprovide that directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast by stockholders, which results in each director nominee elected by a plurality winning his or her seat upon receiving one \"for\" vote; and\n\u2022\nprovide that the board of directors is divided into three classes, as nearly equal in number as possible, with one class being elected at each annual meeting of stockholders, which could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or discourage a third party from seeking to acquire, control of Cannae.\nThese restrictions and provisions could keep us from pursuing relationships with strategic partners and from raising additional capital, which could impede our ability to expand our business and strengthen our competitive position. These restrictions could also limit stockholder value by impeding a sale of our company.", "PERMNO": 17036, "SIC": 5812, "TIC": "CNNE"}
