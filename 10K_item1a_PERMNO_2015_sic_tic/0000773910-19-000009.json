{"cik": "773910", "company": "ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents incorporated herein by reference contain forward-looking statements based on expectations, estimates, and projections as of the date of this filing. These statements by their nature are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions and are influenced by various factors. As a consequence, actual results may differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. See Cautionary Statement About Forward-Looking Statements on page 4 for additional information.\nRISK FACTORS\nOur business and operations are subject to significant hazards and risks, such as the risks described below. Such risks may not be the only risks we face, as our business and operations may also be subject to risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently believe are immaterial. Each of these risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock. The following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information contained herein, including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes.\nOil, natural-gas, and NGL price volatility, including a substantial or extended decline in the price of these commodities, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nPrices for oil, natural gas, and NGLs can fluctuate widely. Our revenues, operating results, cash flows from operations, capital budget, and future growth rates are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our oil, natural gas, and NGLs. The markets for oil, natural gas, and NGLs have been volatile historically and may continue to be volatile in the future. Factors influencing the prices of oil, natural gas, and NGLs are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n-\nthe domestic and worldwide supply of, and demand for, oil, natural gas, and NGLs\n-\nvolatility and trading patterns in the commodity-futures markets\n-\nthe cost of exploring for, developing, producing, transporting, and marketing oil, natural gas, and NGLs\n-\nthe level of global oil and natural-gas inventories\n-\nweather conditions\n-\nthe level of U.S. exports of oil, LNG, or NGLs\n-\nthe ability of the members of OPEC and other producing nations to agree to and maintain production levels\n-\nthe worldwide military and political environment, civil and political unrest worldwide, including in Africa and the Middle East, uncertainty or instability resulting from the escalation or additional outbreak of armed hostilities, or acts of terrorism in the United States or elsewhere\n-\nthe effect of worldwide energy conservation and environmental protection efforts\n-\nthe price and availability of alternative and competing fuels\n-\nthe level of foreign imports of oil, natural gas, and NGLs\n-\ndomestic and foreign governmental laws, regulations, and taxes\n-\nshareholder activism or activities by non-governmental organizations to limit certain sources of funding for the energy sector or restrict the exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas\n-\nthe proximity to, and capacity of, natural-gas pipelines and other transportation facilities\n-\ngeneral economic conditions worldwide\n36 | APC 2018 FORM 10-K\nRISK FACTORS\nThe long-term effect of these and other factors on the prices of oil, natural gas, and NGLs is uncertain. Prolonged or substantial decline in these commodity prices may have the following effects on our business:\n-\nadversely affect our financial condition, liquidity, ability to finance planned capital expenditures, ability to repurchase shares, reduce debt and pay dividends, and results of operations\n-\nreduce the amount of oil, natural gas, and NGLs that we can produce economically\n-\ncause us to delay or postpone some of our capital projects\n-\nreduce our revenues, operating income, or cash flows\n-\nreduce the amounts of our estimated proved oil, natural-gas, and NGL reserves\n-\nreduce the carrying value of our oil, natural-gas, and midstream properties due to recognizing additional impairments of proved properties, unproved properties, exploration assets, and midstream facilities\n-\nreduce the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to oil, natural-gas, and NGL reserves\n-\nlimit our access to, or increasing the cost of, sources of capital such as equity and long-term debt\n-\nadversely affect the ability of our partners to fund their working interest capital requirements\nWe are subject to complex laws and regulations relating to environmental protection that can adversely affect the cost, manner, and feasibility of doing business.\nOur operations and properties are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing the release of pollutants or otherwise relating to environmental protection that may be imposed internationally, domestically at the federal, regional, state, tribal and local levels, or by foreign governments. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, the following activities and matters:\n-\nissuance of permits in connection with exploration, drilling, production, produced water disposal, and other upstream and midstream activities\n-\ndrilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, and other protected areas\n-\ntypes, quantities, and concentrations of emissions, discharges, and authorized releases\n-\ngeneration, management, and disposition of waste materials\n-\noffshore oil and natural-gas operations and decommissioning of abandoned facilities\n-\nreclamation and abandonment of wells and facility sites\n-\nremediation of contaminated sites\n-\nprotection of endangered species\nThese laws and regulations may impose substantial liabilities for our failure to comply or for any contamination resulting from our operations or any property we\u2019ve acquired, including the assessment of administrative, civil, and criminal penalties; the imposition of investigatory, remedial, and corrective action obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures; the occurrence of delays or cancellations in the permitting, development, or expansion of projects; and the issuance of injunctions restricting or prohibiting some or all of our activities in a particular area. Moreover, changes in, or reinterpretations of, environmental laws and regulations governing areas where we operate may adversely impact our operations. Examples of recent proposed and final regulations or other regulatory initiatives include the following:\n-\nGround-Level Ozone Standards. In October 2015, the EPA issued a rule under the Clean Air Act, lowering the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ground-level ozone from 75 parts per billion to 70 parts per billion under both the primary and secondary standards to provide requisite protection of public health and welfare, respectively. In 2017 and 2018, the EPA issued area designations with respect to ground-level ozone as either \u201cattainment/unclassifiable,\u201d unclassifiable\u201d or \u201cnon-attainment.\u201d Additionally, in November 2018, the EPA issued final requirements that apply to state, local, and tribal air agencies for implementing the 2015 NAAQS for ground-level ozone. State implementation of the revised NAAQS could, among other things, require installation of new emission controls on some of our equipment, result in longer permitting timelines, and significantly increase our capital expenditures and operating costs.\n-\nReduction of Methane Emissions by the Oil and Gas Industry. In June 2016, the EPA published a final rule establishing new emissions standards for methane and additional standards for volatile organic compounds from certain new, modified, and reconstructed oil and natural-gas production and natural-gas processing and transmission facilities. The EPA\u2019s rule is under the New Source Performance Standards, Subpart OOOOa, that requires certain new, modified, or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural-gas sector to reduce these methane\nAPC 2018 FORM 10-K | 37\nRISK FACTORS\ngas and volatile organic compound emissions. These Subpart OOOOa standards expand previously issued New Source Performance Standards, Subpart OOOO, published by the EPA in 2012 by using certain equipment-specific emissions control practices with respect to, among other things, hydraulically fractured oil and natural-gas well completions, fugitive emissions from well sites and compressors, and pneumatic pumps. In February 2018, the EPA finalized amendments to certain requirements of the 2015 final rule, and in September 2018 the EPA proposed additional amendments, including rescission of certain requirements and revisions to other requirements, such as fugitive emission monitoring frequency. Notwithstanding the current uncertainty with these rules establishing emission standards for methane and VOCs and BLM\u2019s 2016 final rule to reduce methane emissions from venting, flaring, and leaking from oil and natural-gas operations on public lands, we have taken measures to enter into a voluntary regime, together with certain other oil and natural gas exploration and production operators, to reduce methane emissions. At the state level, some states are considering and others have issued requirements, including Colorado where we conduct operations, for the performance of leak-detection programs that identify and repair methane leaks at certain oil and natural-gas sources. Compliance with these rules or future methane regulations will, among other things, require installation of new emission controls on some of our equipment and increase our capital expenditures and operating costs.\n-\nInduced Seismic Activity Associated with Oilfield Disposal Wells. We dispose of wastewater generated from oil and natural-gas production operations directly or through the use of third parties. The legal requirements related to the disposal of wastewater in underground injections wells are subject to change based on concerns of the public or governmental authorities regarding such disposal activities. One such concern relates to seismic events near injection wells used for the disposal of produced water resulting from oil and natural-gas activities. In response to concerns regarding induced seismicity, regulators in some states have imposed, or are considering imposing, additional requirements in the permitting of produced water disposal wells or otherwise to assess any relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells. For example, Colorado developed and follows guidance when issuing underground injection control permits to limit the maximum injection pressure, rate, and volume of water. Texas has also issued rules for wastewater disposal wells that imposed certain permitting and operating restrictions and reporting requirements on disposal wells. In addition, ongoing class action lawsuits, to which we are not currently a party, allege that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal. These developments could result in additional regulations and restrictions on the use of injection wells by us or by commercial disposal well vendors whom we may use from time to time to dispose of wastewater, which could have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures and operating costs, financial condition, and results of operations.\n-\nReduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions. The U.S. Congress and the EPA, in addition to some state and regional authorities, have in recent years considered legislation or regulations to reduce emissions of GHGs. These efforts have included consideration of cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes, GHG reporting and tracking programs, and regulations that directly limit GHG emissions from certain sources. In the absence of federal GHG-limiting legislation, the EPA has determined that GHG emissions present a danger to public health and the environment and has adopted regulations that, among other things, restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the U.S. Clean Air Act and may require the installation of \"best available control technology\" to limit emissions of GHGs from any new or significantly modified facilities that we may seek to construct in the future if they would otherwise emit a large volume of GHGs together with other criteria pollutants. Also, certain of our operations are subject to EPA rules requiring the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from specified onshore and offshore production sources. Additionally, the United States is one of almost 200 nations that, in December 2015, agreed to the Paris Climate Agreement, an international climate change agreement in Paris, France, that calls for countries to set their own GHG emissions targets and be transparent about the measures that each country will use to achieve its GHG emissions targets. The Paris Climate Agreement entered into force in November 2016. However, in August 2017, the U.S. State Department informed the United Nations of the intent of the United States to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, which would result in an effective exit date of November 2020. Notwithstanding any withdrawal from this agreement, the implementation of substantial limitations on GHG emissions in areas where we conduct operations could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas we produce and lower the value of our reserves.\nThese and other regulatory changes could significantly increase our capital expenditures and operating costs or could result in delays to or limitations on our exploration and production activities, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. For a description of certain environmental proceedings in which we are involved, see Legal Proceedings under Item 3 and Note 18-Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\n38 | APC 2018 FORM 10-K\nRISK FACTORS\nLaws and regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing or other oil and natural-gas operations could increase our costs of doing business, result in additional operating restrictions, delays or curtailments, limit the areas in which we can operate, and adversely affect our production.\nHydraulic fracturing is an essential and common practice used to stimulate production of oil and natural gas from dense subsurface rock formations such as shales. We routinely apply hydraulic-fracturing techniques in many of our U.S. onshore oil and natural-gas drilling and completion programs. The process involves the injection of water, sand or alternative proppant, and chemical additives under pressure into a targeted subsurface formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production.\nHydraulic fracturing onshore in the U.S. is typically regulated by state oil and natural-gas commissions and similar agencies. However, the practice has become increasingly controversial in certain parts of the country, resulting in increased scrutiny and regulation, including by federal agencies. For example, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic-fracturing activities under the SDWA involving the use of diesel fuels and published permitting guidance in 2014 addressing the use of diesel in fracturing operations. Additionally, in 2016, the EPA published a final rule under authority of the Clean Water Act prohibiting the discharge of return water recovered from shale natural-gas extraction operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. Also, the BLM published a final rule in 2015 establishing new or more stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian land but the BLM rescinded the 2015 rule in December 2017; however, litigation filed in January 2018 in the federal District Court for the Northern District of California challenging the BLM\u2019s decision to repeal 2015 rule remains pending. Also, from time to time, legislation has been introduced, but not enacted, in the U.S. Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process. In the event that new federal restrictions on the hydraulic-fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we may incur significant additional costs or permitting requirements to comply with such federal requirements, and could experience added delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities.\nIn addition to asserting regulatory authority, a number of federal entities have reviewed various environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing. For example, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. The final report concluded that \u201cwater cycle\u201d activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under certain circumstances.\nCertain states in which we operate, including Colorado, Texas, and Wyoming, have adopted, and other states and local communities are considering adopting, regulations that could impose new or more stringent permitting, disclosure, or other regulatory requirements on hydraulic-fracturing or other oil and natural-gas operations, including subsurface water disposal. For instance, in February 2018, the Colorado Oil & Gas Conservation Commission (COGCC) approved new regulations addressing the operation of flowlines and related infrastructure associated with oil and natural-gas development in the state, including more stringent requirements relating to design, installation, maintenance, testing, tracking, and abandoning of flowlines. The COGCC also approved new regulations in December 2018 enhancing the state\u2019s school setback rules by expanding the definition of a school facility and broadening the boundaries. States also could elect to prohibit high volume hydraulic fracturing altogether, following the approach taken by the State of New York. In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict the time, place and manner of drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular.\nAdditionally, certain interest groups in Colorado opposed to oil and natural-gas development generally, and hydraulic fracturing in particular, have from time to time advanced various options for ballot initiatives that, if approved, would revise either statutory law or the state constitution in a manner that would effectively prohibit or make such exploration and production activities in the state more difficult or expensive in the future. For example, in each of the November 2014, 2016 and 2018 general election cycles, ballot initiatives have been pursued, with the 2018 initiative making the November 2018 ballot, seeking to increase setback distances between new oil and natural-gas development and specific occupied structures and/or certain environmentally sensitive or recreational areas that, if adopted, may have had significant adverse impacts on new oil and natural-gas development in the state. However, in each election cycle, the ballot initiative either did not secure a place on the general ballot or, as was the case in November 2018, was defeated. In the event that ballot initiatives, local or state restrictions, or prohibitions are adopted and result in more stringent limitations on the production and development of oil and natural gas in areas where we conduct operations, whether in Colorado or in another state, we may incur significant costs to comply with such requirements or may experience delays or curtailment in the permitting or pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities. In addition, we could possibly be limited or precluded in the drilling of wells or in the amounts that we are ultimately able to produce from our reserves. Such compliance costs and delays, curtailments, limitations, or prohibitions could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nAPC 2018 FORM 10-K | 39\nRISK FACTORS\nOur Tronox settlement may not be deductible for income tax purposes, and we may be required to repay the tax refund of $881 million received in 2016 related to the deduction of the Tronox settlement payment, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition.\nIn April 2014, Anadarko and Kerr-McGee Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, Kerr-McGee) entered into a settlement agreement for $5.15 billion, resolving all claims that were or could have been asserted in the Tronox Adversary Proceeding. After the settlement became effective in January 2015, we paid $5.2 billion and deducted this payment on our 2015 federal income tax return. Due to the deduction, we had a net operating loss carryback for 2015, which resulted in a tentative tax refund of $881 million in 2016. In our consolidated financial statements, we have recorded an uncertain tax position greater than the amount of the tentative tax refund received.\nThe IRS has audited our tax position regarding the deductibility of the payment and in September 2018 issued a statutory notice of deficiency rejecting the Company\u2019s refund claim. We disagree and filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court to dispute the disallowance in November 2018. It is possible that we may not ultimately succeed in defending this deduction. If the payment is ultimately determined not to be deductible, we would be required to repay the tentative refund received plus interest and reverse the net benefit of $346 million previously recognized in our consolidated financial statements, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition. For additional information on income taxes, see Note 14-Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nOur debt and other financial commitments may limit our financial and operating flexibility.\nAt December 31, 2018, our total consolidated debt of $16.4 billion consisted of $11.6 billion related to Anadarko and $4.8 billion related to WES and WGP. We also have various commitments for leases, drilling contracts, derivative contracts, firm transportation, and purchase obligations for services and products. Our financial commitments could have important consequences to our business, including, but not limited to, the following:\n-\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions\n-\nlimiting our ability to fund future working capital and capital expenditures, to engage in future acquisitions or development activities, or to otherwise fully realize the value of our assets and opportunities because of the need to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt or to comply with any restrictive terms of our debt\n-\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industry in which we operate\n-\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt and/or fewer financial commitments\nAdditionally, the credit agreement governing the APC RCF contains a number of customary covenants, including a financial covenant requiring maintenance of a consolidated indebtedness to total capitalization ratio of no greater than 65% (excluding the effect of non-cash write-downs), and limitations on certain secured indebtedness, sale-and-leaseback transactions, and mergers and other fundamental changes. Our ability to meet such covenants may be affected by events beyond our control.\n40 | APC 2018 FORM 10-K\nRISK FACTORS\nOur proved reserves are estimates. Any material inaccuracies in our reserves estimates or assumptions underlying our reserves estimates could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated.\nThere are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves, including many factors beyond our control that could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated. The reserves information included or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K represents estimates prepared by our internal engineers. The procedures and methods for estimating the reserves by our internal engineers were reviewed by independent petroleum consultants; however, no reserves audit was conducted by these consultants. Estimation of reserves is not an exact science. Estimates of economically recoverable oil, natural-gas, and NGL reserves and of future net cash flows depend on a number of variable factors and assumptions, any of which may cause actual results to vary considerably from these estimates. These factors and assumptions may include, but are not limited to, the following:\n-\nestimated future production from an area is consistent with historical production from similar producing areas\n-\nassumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies and court rulings\n-\nassumptions concerning future oil, natural-gas, and NGL prices, future operating costs, and capital expenditures\n-\nestimates of future severance and excise taxes, workover costs, and remedial costs\nEstimates of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of expected future net cash flows prepared by different engineers, or by the same engineers at different times, may vary substantially. Actual production, revenues, and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates, and the variance may be material. The discounted cash flows included in this Form 10-K should not be construed as the fair value of the estimated oil, natural-gas, and NGL reserves attributable to our properties. The estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are based on the average beginning-of-month prices during the 12-month period for the respective year. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from the SEC regulation-compliant prices used for purposes of estimating future discounted net cash flows from proved reserves. Therefore, reserves quantities will change when actual prices increase or decrease.\nFailure to replace reserves may negatively affect our business.\nOur future success depends on our ability to find, develop, or acquire additional oil and natural-gas reserves that are economically recoverable. Our proved reserves generally decline when reserves are produced, unless we conduct successful exploration or development activities, acquire properties containing proved reserves, or both. We may be unable to find, develop, or acquire additional reserves on an economic basis. Furthermore, if oil and natural-gas prices increase, our costs for finding or acquiring additional reserves could also increase.\nA downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our long-term debt was rated \u201cBBB\u201d by S&P and Fitch with a stable outlook by S&P and a positive outlook by Fitch. Our long-term debt was rated \u201cBa1\u201d with a stable outlook by Moody\u2019s, which is below investment grade. Subsequent to year end, Moody\u2019s changed its outlook with respect to its rating from stable to positive. Our commercial paper program was rated \u201cA-2\u201d by S&P, \u201cF2\u201d by Fitch, and \u201cNP\u201d by Moody\u2019s. Although we are not aware of any current plans of S&P, Fitch, or Moody\u2019s to lower their respective credit ratings on our long-term debt, we cannot be assured that our credit ratings will not be downgraded. A downgrade in our credit ratings could negatively impact our cost of capital and could also adversely affect our ability to effectively execute aspects of our strategy or to raise debt in the public debt markets. In addition, a downgrade could affect the Company\u2019s requirements to provide financial assurance of its performance under certain contractual arrangements and derivative agreements. For additional information, see Note 11-Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nAPC 2018 FORM 10-K | 41\nRISK FACTORS\nOur domestic operations are subject to governmental risks that may impact our operations.\nOur domestic operations have been, and at times in the future may be, affected by political developments and are subject to complex provincial, federal, regional, state, tribal, local, and other laws and regulations such as restrictions on production, permitting, changes in taxes, deductions, royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies, price or gathering-rate controls, and hydraulic fracturing, induced seismicity, and environmental protection regulations. To the extent our domestic operations are offshore, we must also comply with requirements focused on oil and natural-gas exploration and production activities in coastal and outer continental shelf (OCS) waters. To conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations, we must obtain and maintain numerous permits, approvals, and certificates from various provincial, federal, regional, state, tribal, and local governmental authorities. We may incur substantial costs to maintain compliance with these existing laws and regulations. In addition, government disruptions, such as an extended federal government shutdown resulting from the failure to pass budget appropriations or adopt continuing funding resolutions could delay or halt the granting and renewal of such permits, approvals, and certificates required to conduct our operations. As a result, activity in the affected regions, such as the Gulf of Mexico and on federal and Indian lands in the United States, could be adversely affected or delayed.\nOur domestic midstream operations are subject to governmental risks by federal or state regulators that may impact our operations and revenues.\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has authority to regulate the rates and terms and conditions of service of natural gas, oil, NGL, and other liquids pipelines operating in interstate commerce. The FERC could exercise jurisdiction over our midstream operations to the extent it determines they operate in interstate commerce. Should we fail to comply with laws the FERC administers, we could be subject to substantial monetary penalties. State regulators in the areas where we have midstream operations may likewise have authority to regulate the rates and terms and conditions of service of, and impose monetary penalties on, our natural gas, oil, NGL, and other liquids pipelines operating in intrastate commerce. To the extent a federal or state regulator imposes rate or service limitations on our midstream operations, it may adversely affect our operations and revenues, either directly or through WES\u2019s operations.\nFuture economic, business, or industry conditions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition.\nHistorically, concerns about global economic growth, including issues related to tariffs and geopolitical issues, have had a significant adverse impact on global financial markets and commodity prices. Continued concerns could cause demand for petroleum products to diminish or stagnate, which could impact the price at which we can sell our oil, natural gas, and NGLs and impede the execution of long-term sales agreements or prices thereunder, which are the basis for future LNG production; affect the ability of our vendors, suppliers, and customers to continue operations; and ultimately adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition.\nOur business may be adversely affected by deterioration in the credit quality of, or defaults under our contracts with, third parties with whom we do business.\nThe operation of our business requires us to engage in transactions with numerous counterparties operating in a variety of industries, including other companies operating in the oil and gas industry. These counterparties may default on their obligations to us as a result of operational failures or a lack of liquidity, or for other reasons, including bankruptcy. A default by any of our counterparties may result in our inability to perform obligations under agreements we have made with third parties or may otherwise adversely affect our business or results of operations. For certain assets where we rely on third-party customers for substantially all of our revenues related to those assets, the loss of all or even a portion of the contracted production volume could result in reduced throughput on those systems causing a decline in revenues and the potential impairment of the impacted assets. Furthermore, our rights against any of our counterparties as a result of a default may not be adequate to compensate us for the resulting harm caused or may not be enforceable at all in some circumstances.\n42 | APC 2018 FORM 10-K\nRISK FACTORS\nWe are vulnerable to risks associated with our offshore operations that could negatively impact our operations and financial results.\nWe conduct offshore operations in the Gulf of Mexico, Ghana, Mozambique, and other countries. Our operations and financial results could be significantly impacted by conditions in some of these areas and are also vulnerable to certain unique risks associated with operating offshore, including those relating to the following:\n-\nhurricanes and other adverse weather conditions\n-\ngeological complexities and water depths associated with such operations\n-\nlimited number of partners available to participate in projects\n-\noilfield service costs and availability\n-\ncompliance with environmental, safety, and other laws and regulations\n-\nterrorist attacks or piracy\n-\nremediation and other costs and regulatory changes resulting from oil spills or releases of hazardous materials\n-\nfailure of equipment or facilities\n-\nresponse capabilities for personnel, equipment, or environmental incidents\nIn addition, we conduct some of our exploration in deep waters (greater than 1,000 feet) where operations, support services, and decommissioning activities are more difficult and costly than in shallower waters. The deep waters in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as international deepwater locations, lack the physical and oilfield service infrastructure present in shallower waters. As a result, deepwater operations may require significant time between a discovery and the time that we can market our production, thereby increasing the risk involved with these operations.\nAdditional domestic and international deepwater drilling laws, regulations and other restrictions; delays in the processing and approval of drilling permits and exploration, development, oil spill-response and decommissioning plans; and other offshore-related developments may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nThe BOEM and the BSEE have imposed more stringent permitting procedures and regulatory safety and performance requirements for new wells to be drilled in federal waters. Compliance with these more stringent regulatory requirements and with existing environmental and oil spill regulations, together with any uncertainties or inconsistencies in decisions and rulings by governmental agencies, delays in the processing and approval of drilling permits or exploration, development, oil spill-response and decommissioning plans, and possible additional regulatory initiatives could result in difficult and more costly actions and adversely affect or delay new drilling and ongoing development efforts.\nAdditionally, these governmental agencies are continuing to evaluate and develop and implement new, more restrictive requirements that could result in additional costs, delays, restrictions, or obligations with respect to oil and natural-gas exploration and production operations conducted offshore. For example, in April 2016, the BSEE published a final rule on well control that, among other things, imposes rigorous standards relating to the design, operation and maintenance of blowout preventers, real-time monitoring of deepwater and high temperature, high pressure drilling activities, and enhanced reporting requirements. In May 2018, however, the BSEE issued a proposed rule, which has not been finalized, to revise these regulations for well control.\nMoreover, in September 2016, the BOEM issued a Notice to Leaseholders (NTL) that would bolster supplemental bonding procedures for the decommissioning of offshore wells, platforms, pipelines, and other facilities; however, since the BOEM\u2019s issuance of the NTL, the agency has delayed indefinitely, beyond June 30, 2017, the implementation timeline of the NTL for most of those facilities so that BOEM could further assess this financial assurance program, but this delay is expected to be temporary. Following completion of its review, the BOEM may elect to retain the September 2016 NTL in its current form or may make revisions thereto and, thus, until the review is completed and the BOEM determines what additional financial assurance may be required by us, we cannot provide any assurance of the amount of any additional financial assurance, which may be material, that may be ordered by the BOEM and required in any proposed tailored plan that we may submit to the BOEM in the future for approval, or that such additional financial assurance amounts can be obtained.\nAPC 2018 FORM 10-K | 43\nRISK FACTORS\nThese regulatory actions, or any new rules, regulations or legal initiatives, could delay or disrupt our operations, increase the risk of expired leases due to the time required to develop new technology, result in increased supplemental bonding and costs and limit activities in certain areas, or cause us to incur penalties, fines or shut-in production at one or more of our facilities or result in the suspension or cancellation of leases. Moreover, under existing BOEM and BSEE rules relating to assignment of offshore leases and other legal interests on the OCS, assignors of such interests may be held jointly and severally liable for decommissioning of OCS facilities existing at the time the assignment was approved by the BOEM, in the event that the assignee or any subsequent assignee is unable or unwilling to conduct required decommissioning. In the event that we, in the role of assignor, receive orders from the BSEE to decommission OCS facilities that one of our assignees, or a subsequent assignee, of offshore facilities is unwilling or unable to perform, we could incur costs to perform those decommissioning obligations, which costs could be material.\nIn addition, our offshore development activities rely on subcontractors to perform certain offshore construction and installation activities. The Jones Act requires that vessels engaged in U.S. coastwise trade be built in the United States, registered under the U.S. flag, manned by predominantly U.S. crews, and owned and operated by U.S. citizens within the meaning of the Jones Act. Under existing U.S. Customs & Border Protection (CBP) rulings, the Jones Act is not applicable to foreign vessels conducting certain construction and pipeline installation activities on the OCS. Recently, the U.S. Marine Vessel Owners Association filed a lawsuit seeking to compel CBP to revoke a number of long-standing ruling letters relating to this exemption. The outcome of this litigation is uncertain. However, if the litigation is successful and the rulings are revoked, foreign flagged vessels could no longer perform certain operations for us in compliance with the Jones Act. The existing fleet of U.S. vessels are currently incapable of performing these construction and installation activities. As a result, certain of our development efforts could be delayed, disrupted or even suspended.\nAlso, if material spill events were to occur in the future, the United States or other countries where such an event were to occur could issue directives to temporarily cease drilling activities and, in any event, may from time to time issue further safety and environmental laws and regulations regarding offshore oil and natural-gas exploration and development. We cannot predict with any certainty the full impact of any new laws, regulations, or legal initiatives on our drilling operations or on the cost or availability of insurance to cover the risks associated with such operations. The overall costs to implement and complete any such spill response activities or any decommissioning obligations could exceed estimated accruals, insurance limits, or supplemental bonding amounts, which could result in the incurrence of additional costs to complete.\nFurther, the deepwater Gulf of Mexico (as well as international deepwater locations) lacks the degree of physical and oilfield service infrastructure present in shallower waters. Therefore, despite our oil spill-response capabilities, it may be difficult for us to quickly or effectively execute any contingency plans related to potential material deepwater events in the future.\nThe matters described above, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\n44 | APC 2018 FORM 10-K\nRISK FACTORS\nWe operate in foreign countries and are subject to political, economic, and other uncertainties.\nWe have operations outside the United States, including in Algeria, Ghana, Mozambique, Colombia, Peru, and other countries. As a result, we face political and economic risks and other uncertainties with respect to our international operations. These risks may include the following, among other things:\n-\nloss of revenue, property, and equipment or delays in operations as a result of hazards such as expropriation, war, piracy, acts of terrorism, insurrection, civil unrest, and other political risks, including tension and confrontations among political parties\n-\ntransparency issues in general and, more specifically, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and other anti-corruption compliance laws and issues\n-\nincreases in taxes and governmental royalties\n-\nunilateral renegotiation of contracts by governmental entities\n-\nredefinition of international boundaries or boundary disputes\n-\ndifficulties enforcing our rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations\n-\ndifficulties enforcing our rights against a governmental agency in the absence of an appropriate and adequate dispute resolution mechanism to address contractual disputes, such as international arbitration\n-\nchanges in laws and policies governing operations of foreign-based companies\n-\nforeign-exchange restrictions\n-\ninternational monetary fluctuations and changes in the relative value of the U.S. dollar as compared to the currencies of other countries in which we conduct business\nOutbreaks of civil and political unrest and acts of terrorism have occurred in countries in Europe, Africa, South America, and the Middle East, including countries close to or where we conduct operations. Continued or escalated civil and political unrest and acts of terrorism in the countries in which we operate could result in our curtailing operations or delays in project completions. In the event that countries in which we operate experience civil or political unrest or acts of terrorism, especially in events where such unrest leads to an unseating of the established government, our operations could be materially impaired.\nOur international operations may also be adversely affected, directly or indirectly, by laws, policies, and regulations of the United States affecting foreign trade and taxation, including U.S. trade sanctions.\nRealization of any of the factors listed above could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nThe high cost or unavailability of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel, and other oilfield services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur industry is cyclical and, from time to time, there is a shortage of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, or qualified personnel. The cost for such items may increase as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control, such as increases in the cost of electricity, steel, and other raw materials that we and our vendors rely upon; increased demand for labor, services, and materials as drilling activity increases; and increased taxes. Additionally, these services may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. The high cost or unavailability of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel, and other oilfield services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nAPC 2018 FORM 10-K | 45\nRISK FACTORS\nDeterioration in the credit or equity markets could adversely affect us.\nWe have exposure to different counterparties. For example, we have entered into transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, investment banks, insurance companies, investment funds, and other institutions. These transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default by our counterparty. Deterioration in the credit markets may impact the credit ratings of our current and potential counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill existing obligations to us and their willingness to enter into future transactions with us. We have exposure to these financial institutions through our derivative transactions. In addition, if any lender under our credit facilities is unable to fund its commitment, our liquidity will be reduced by an amount up to the aggregate amount of such lender\u2019s commitment under our credit facilities. Moreover, to the extent that purchasers of our production rely on access to the credit or equity markets to fund their operations, there is a risk that those purchasers could default in their contractual obligations to us if such purchasers were unable to access the credit or equity markets for an extended period of time.\nExploration, development, and production activities carry inherent risk. These activities could result in liability exposure or the loss of production and revenues. In addition, we are not insured against all of the operating risks to which our business is exposed.\nOur business is subject to all of the hazards and operating risks normally associated with the exploration for and production, gathering, processing, and transportation of oil and natural gas, including blowouts; cratering and fire; environmental hazards such as natural-gas leaks, oil spills, pipeline and vessel ruptures, and releases of chemicals or other hazardous substances, any of which could result in damage to, or destruction of, oil and natural-gas wells or formations, production facilities, and other property; pollution or other environmental damage; and injury to persons. Some of these risks or hazards could materially and adversely affect our revenues and expenses by reducing or shutting in production from wells, resulting in loss of equipment or otherwise negatively impacting the projected economic performance of our projects. Any of these risks or hazards can result in injuries and/or deaths of employees, supplier personnel or other individuals, loss of hydrocarbons, environmental pollution and other damage to our properties or the properties of others, regulatory investigations, litigation, fines, and penalties or restricted access to our properties.\nFor protection against financial loss resulting from these operating hazards, we maintain insurance coverage, including insurance coverage for certain physical damage, blowout/loss of control of a well, comprehensive general liability, aviation liability, and worker\u2019s compensation and employer\u2019s liability. However, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover us against 100% of potential losses arising as a result of the foregoing and for certain risks, such as political risk, business interruption, war, terrorism, and piracy, for which we have limited or no coverage. In addition, we are not insured against all risks in all aspects of our business such as hurricanes. The occurrence of a significant event against which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur commodity-price risk-management and trading activities may prevent us from fully benefiting from price increases and may expose us to regulatory and other risks.\nTo the extent that we engage in commodity-price risk-management activities to protect our cash flows from commodity-price declines, we may be prevented from realizing the full benefits of price increases above the levels of the derivative instruments used to manage price risk. In addition, our commodity-price risk-management and trading activities may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which the following occur:\n-\nour production is less than the notional volume\n-\na widening of price basis differentials occurs between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the derivative arrangement\n-\nthe counterparties to our hedging or other price-risk management contracts fail to perform under those arrangements\n-\na sudden unexpected event materially impacts oil, natural-gas, or NGL prices\nWe are required to observe the market-related regulations enforced by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and other agencies with regard to our commodity-price risk-management activities, which hold substantial enforcement authority. Failures to comply with such regulations, as interpreted and enforced, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n46 | APC 2018 FORM 10-K\nRISK FACTORS\nMaterial differences between the estimated and actual timing of critical events may affect the completion, cost and commencement of production from development projects.\nWe are involved in certain large development projects and the completion of those projects may be delayed beyond our anticipated completion dates. Key factors that may affect the timing and outcome of such projects include the following:\n-\nproject approvals and funding by joint-venture partners\n-\ntimely issuance of permits and licenses by governmental agencies or legislative and other governmental approvals\n-\nweather conditions\n-\navailability of qualified personnel\n-\ncivil and political environment of, and existing infrastructure in, the country or region in which the project is located\n-\nmanufacturing and delivery schedules of critical equipment\n-\ncommercial arrangements for pipelines, tankers, and related equipment to transport and market hydrocarbons\nDelays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events may affect the forward-looking statements related to large development projects. If we are unable to complete such projects at their expected costs and in a timely manner, our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially and adversely effected.\nThe oil and gas exploration and production industry is very competitive, and some of our exploration and production competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do.\nThe oil and gas business is highly competitive in the search for and acquisition of reserves and in the gathering and marketing of oil and gas production. Our competitors include national oil companies, major integrated oil and gas companies, independent oil and gas companies, individual producers, gas marketers, and major pipeline companies as well as participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to consumers. Some of our competitors may have greater and more diverse resources on which to draw than we do. If we are not successful in our competition for oil and gas reserves or in our marketing of production, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur drilling activities may not encounter commercially productive oil or natural-gas reservoirs.\nDrilling for oil and natural gas involves numerous risks, including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or natural-gas reservoirs. Drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed, or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including the following:\n-\nunexpected drilling conditions\n-\npressure or irregularities in formations\n-\nequipment failures or accidents\n-\nfires, explosions, blowouts, and surface cratering\n-\nmarine risks such as capsizing, collisions, and hurricanes\n-\ndifficulty identifying and retaining qualified personnel\n-\ntitle problems\n-\nother adverse weather conditions\n-\nlack of availability or delays in the delivery of technology, equipment, or resources for operations\nCertain of our future drilling activities may not be successful and, if unsuccessful, could result in a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. While all drilling, whether developmental or exploratory, involves these risks, exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. Because a portion of our capital budget is devoted to higher-risk exploratory projects, it is likely that we will continue to experience significant exploration and dry hole expenses.\nAPC 2018 FORM 10-K | 47\nRISK FACTORS\nWe have limited influence over the activities on properties we do not operate.\nOther companies operate some of the properties in which we have an interest. We have limited ability to influence the operation or future development of these nonoperated properties or the amount or timing of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to them. Our dependence on the operator and other working-interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence the operation and future development of these properties could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital, adversely affect the timing of activities, or lead to unexpected future costs, including costs associated with the hazards and operating risks normally associated with the exploration for and production, gathering, processing, and transportation of oil and natural gas, including blowouts; cratering and fire; environmental hazards such as natural-gas leaks, oil spills, pipeline and vessel ruptures, and releases of chemicals or other hazardous substances.\nOur ability to sell and deliver our oil, natural-gas, and NGL production could be materially harmed if adequate gathering, processing, compression, transportation, and disposal facilities and equipment are unavailable.\nThe marketability of our production depends in part on the availability, proximity, and capacity of gathering, processing, compression, transportation, tankers, pipeline, and produced water facilities. These facilities may be temporarily unavailable to us due to market conditions, regulatory reasons, mechanical reasons or other factors or conditions. If any pipelines or tankers become unavailable, we would, to the extent possible, be required to find a suitable alternative to transport the oil, natural gas, and NGLs, which could increase our costs and/or reduce the revenues we might obtain from the sale of the oil and natural-gas. In addition, in certain newer plays, the capacity of gathering, processing, compression, transportation, and disposal facilities and equipment may not be sufficient to accommodate potential production from existing and new wells. Construction and permitting delays, permitting costs and regulatory or other constraints could limit or delay the construction, manufacture or other acquisition of new gathering, processing, compression, transportation, and disposal facilities and equipment, and we may experience delays or increased costs in accessing the pipelines, gathering systems or rail systems necessary to transport our production to points of sale or delivery or disposing of produced water.\nAny significant change in market or other conditions affecting gathering, processing, compression, transportation, or disposal facilities and equipment or the availability of these facilities, including due to our failure or inability to obtain access to these facilities and equipment on terms acceptable to us or at all, could materially and adversely affect our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by goodwill impairments.\nAs a result of mergers and acquisitions, we had approximately $4.8 billion of goodwill on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2018. Goodwill must be tested at least annually for impairment, and more frequently when circumstances indicate likely impairment. Goodwill is considered impaired to the extent that its carrying amount exceeds its implied fair value. Various factors could reduce the fair value of a reporting unit such as our inability to replace the value of our depleting asset base, difficulty or potential delays in obtaining drilling permits, or other adverse events such as lower oil and natural-gas prices, which could lead to an impairment of goodwill. An impairment of goodwill could have a substantial negative effect on our reported earnings.\n48 | APC 2018 FORM 10-K\nRISK FACTORS\nRisks related to acquisitions and divestitures may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAny acquisition involves potential risks, including, among other things:\n-\nthe validity of our assumptions about, among other things, reserves, estimated production, revenues, capital expenditures, operating expenses, and costs\n-\nthe assumption of environmental, decommissioning, and other liabilities, and losses or costs for which we are not indemnified or for which our indemnity is inadequate\n-\na failure to attain or maintain compliance with environmental, safety, and other governmental regulations\nIn addition, from time to time, we may sell or otherwise dispose of certain of our properties as a result of an evaluation of our asset portfolio and to help enhance our liquidity. These transactions also have inherent risks, including:\n-\npossible delays in closing\n-\nlower-than-expected sales proceeds for the disposed assets\n-\npotential post-closing claims for indemnification\nMoreover, the agreements relating to these transactions contain provisions pursuant to which liabilities related to past and future operations, such as matters of litigation, environmental contingencies, royalty obligations and income taxes, have been allocated between the parties by means of liability assumptions, indemnities, escrows, trusts and similar arrangements. The magnitude of any such retained liability or indemnification obligation may be difficult to quantify at the time of the transaction and ultimately may be material. Also, as is typical in divestiture transactions, third parties may be unwilling to release the Company from guarantees or other credit support provided prior to the sale of the divested assets. In addition, one or more of the parties in these transactions could fail to perform its obligations under the agreements as a result of financial distress. In the event that any such counterparty were to become the subject of a case proceeding under Title 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any other insolvency law or similar law, the counterparty may not perform its obligations under the agreement and we may be responsible for the cost of the obligations assumed by the counterparties. As a result, after a divestiture, the Company may remain secondarily liable for the obligations guaranteed or supported to the extent that the buyer of the assets fails to perform these obligations.\nIf any of these risks materialize, the benefits of such acquisition or divestiture may not be fully realized, if at all, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nAPC 2018 FORM 10-K | 49\nRISK FACTORS\nOur business could be negatively affected by security threats, including cyber threats, and other disruptions.\nAs an oil and gas producer, we face various security threats, including cyber threats such as attempts to gain unauthorized access to, or control of, sensitive information or to render data or systems corrupted or unusable; threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure or those of third parties such as processing plants and pipelines; and threats from terrorist acts. Our implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate security threats and to increase security for our information, facilities, and infrastructure may result in increased costs. In addition, our business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies and we anticipate expanding our use of technology in our operations, including through data analytics and process automation. Further, we have exposure to cyber incidents and the negative impacts of such incidents related to our critical data and proprietary information housed on third-party information technology systems, including the cloud. Our vendors and other business partners may also separately suffer disruptions or breaches from cyber attacks which could adversely impact our operations and compromise our information. We continuously work to install new, and upgrade existing, information technology systems and provide employee awareness training on phishing, malware, and other cyber risks to help ensure that we are protected, to the extent possible, against cyber risks and security breaches. We also perform periodic drills for responding to cyber incidences. There can be no assurance that such safeguards, procedures, and controls will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring. Cyber attacks in particular are becoming more sophisticated and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to, or control of our data, systems, or facilities, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, and corruption of data or systems, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWhile we have experienced cyber attacks, we have not suffered any material losses relating to such attacks; however, there is no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. We could incur substantial remediation and other costs or suffer other negative consequences, including litigation risks. In addition, as cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate or remediate any cyber vulnerabilities.\nProvisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change of control of Anadarko, even if that change would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain provisions that may make a change of control of Anadarko difficult, even if it may be beneficial to our stockholders, including provisions governing the nomination and removal of directors, the prohibition of stockholder action by written consent and regulation of stockholders\u2019 ability to bring matters for action before annual stockholder meetings, and the authorization given to our Board of Directors to issue and set the terms of preferred stock.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock.\nWe may reduce or cease to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe can provide no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends at the current rate or at all. As of February 2019, our quarterly dividend was $0.30 per share. The amount of cash dividends, if any, to be paid in the future is determined by our Board of Directors based on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, levels of capital and exploration expenditures, future business prospects, expected liquidity needs, and other matters that our Board of Directors deems relevant.\nDifficulty attracting and retaining experienced technical personnel could reduce our competitiveness and prospects for future success.\nOur exploratory drilling success and the success of other development and operating activities depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced explorationists, engineers, and other professionals. Competition for such professionals could be intense. If we cannot retain our technical personnel or attract additional experienced technical personnel, our ability to compete could be harmed.\n50 | APC 2018 FORM 10-K\nOTHER INFORMATION", "PERMNO": 70332, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "APC"}
