{"cik": "1621832", "company": "Aqua Metals, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThere are numerous and varied risks, known and unknown, that may prevent us from achieving our goals. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operation may be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and investors could lose all or part of their investment.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nSince we have a limited operating history and have only recently commenced lead-producing operations, it is difficult for potential investors to evaluate our business. \u2003We formed our corporation in June 2014 and only commenced revenue producing operations in January 2017. To date, our operations have consisted of the development and limited testing of our AquaRefining process, the development of our business plan, the raise of our present working capital and the development of our initial LAB recycling facility in Tahoe Regional Industrial Center, McCarran, Nevada (\u201cTRIC\u201d). Our limited operating history makes it difficult for potential investors to evaluate our technology or prospective operations. As an early stage company, we are subject to all the risks inherent in the initial organization, financing, expenditures, complications and delays in a new business. Investors should evaluate an investment in us in light of the uncertainties encountered by developing companies in a competitive environment. There can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful or that we will ultimately be able to attain profitability.\nWe may need additional financing to execute our business plan and fund operations, which additional financing may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. \u2003As of December 31, 2016, we had total assets of $71.5 million and working capital of $23.3 million. Since December 31, 2016, we have received an additional $10.5 million of working capital by way of the sale of our common shares to Johnson Controls. As of the date of this report, and after giving effect to the $10.5 million net investment by Johnson Controls, we believe that we have working capital sufficient to fund our current business plan over the next 12 months, including the attainment of production at the rate of 120 tonnes of recycled lead per day at our TRIC facility. However, we will require additional funding in order to finance our proposed development of additional AquaRefining recycling facilities. We intend to seek additional funds through various financing sources, including the private sale of our equity and debt securities, licensing fees for our technology, joint ventures with capital partners and project financing of our recycling facilities. However, there can be no guarantees that such funds will be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If such funding is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to further pursue our business plan and we may be unable to continue operations, in which case you may lose your entire investment.\nOur business model is new and has not been proven by us or anyone else.\u2003We are engaged in the business of producing recycled lead through a proprietary, patent-pending electro-chemical technology. While the production of recycled lead is an established business, to date all recycled lead has been produced by way of traditional smelting processes. To our knowledge, no one has successfully produced recycled lead in commercial quantities other than by way of smelting. We commenced the commercial scale production of recycled lead at our TRIC facility during January 2017. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to produce lead in commercial quantities at a cost of production that will provide us with an adequate profit margin. The uniqueness of our AquaRefining process presents potential risks associated with the development of a business model that is untried and unproven.\nWhile the testing of our AquaRefining process has been successful to date, there can be no assurance that we will be able to replicate the process, along with all of the expected economic advantages, on a large commercial scale.\u2003 As of the date of this report, we have built and operated both a small-scale unit of our AquaRefining process and a full-size production prototype. In addition, in connection with the commissioning of our TRIC facility, we conducted limited operations at our TRIC facility through the processing of recycled lead through a single AquaRefining module, and through our own on-site assay, we verified that the lead produced in the AquaRefining module is over 99.99 percent pure. During January 2017, we commenced the commercial scale production of recycled lead at our TRIC facility. While we believe that our development, testing and limited production to date has proven the concept of our AquaRefining process, the limited nature of our operations to date are not sufficient to confirm the economic returns on our production of recycled lead. There can be no assurance that the commencement of commercial scale operations at our TRIC facility will not incur unexpected costs or hurdles that might restrict the desired scale of our intended operations or negatively impact our projected gross profit margin.\nOur intellectual property rights may not be adequate to protect our business.\u2003We currently do not hold any patents for our products and processes. To date, we have filed seven international applications, two U.S. patent applications, and have twenty foreign applications pending, relating to certain elements of the technology underlying our AquaRefining process and related apparatus and chemical formulations. Although we expect to continue filing, where applicable, patent applications related to our technology, no assurances can be given that any patent will be issued on our patent applications or any other application that we may file in the future or that, if such patents are issued, they will be sufficiently broad to adequately protect our technology. In addition, we cannot assure you that any patents that may be issued to us will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented.\nEven if patents are issued to us, they may not stop a competitor from illegally using our patented processes and materials. In such event, we would incur substantial costs and expenses, including lost time of management in addressing and litigating, if necessary, such matters. Additionally, we rely upon a combination of trade secret laws and nondisclosure agreements with third parties and employees having access to confidential information or receiving unpatented proprietary know-how, trade secrets and technology to protect our proprietary rights and technology. These laws and agreements provide only limited protection. We can give no assurance that these measures will adequately protect us from misappropriation of proprietary information.\nOur processes may infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, which could lead to costly disputes or disruptions.\u2003 The applied science industry is characterized by frequent allegations of intellectual property infringement. Though we do not expect to be subject to any of these allegations, any allegation of infringement could be time consuming and expensive to defend or resolve, result in substantial diversion of management resources, cause suspension of operations or force us to enter into royalty, license, or other agreements rather than dispute the merits of such allegation. If patent holders or other holders of intellectual property initiate legal proceedings, we may be forced into protracted and costly litigation. We may not be successful in defending such litigation and may not be able to procure any required royalty or license agreements on acceptable terms or at all.\nOur business strategy includes licensing arrangements and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances. Failure to successfully integrate such licensing arrangements, joint ventures, or strategic alliances into our operations could adversely affect our business.\u2003 We propose to commercially exploit our AquaRefining process, in part, by licensing our technology to third parties and entering into joint ventures and strategic relationships with parties involved in the manufacture and recycling of LABs. Licensing programs, joint ventures and strategic alliances may involve significant other risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management\u2019s attention away from normal business operations, insufficient revenue generation to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with the transaction, and unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence process, such as product quality, technology issues and legal contingencies. In addition, we may be unable to effectively integrate any such programs and ventures into our operations. Our operating results could be adversely affected by any problems arising during or from any licenses, joint ventures or strategic alliances.\nIf we are unable to manage future expansion effectively, our business, operations and financial condition may suffer significantly, resulting in decreased productivity.\u2003 If our AquaRefining process proves to be commercially valuable, it is likely that we will experience a rapid growth phase that could place a significant strain on our managerial, administrative, technical, operational and financial resources. Our organization, procedures and management may not be adequate to fully support the expansion of our operations or the efficient execution of our business strategy. If we are unable to manage future expansion effectively, our business, operations and financial condition may suffer significantly, resulting in decreased productivity.\nCertain industry participants may have the ability to restrict our access to used LABs and otherwise focus significant competitive pressure on us.\u2003 We believe that our primary competition will come from operators of existing smelters and other parties invested in the existing supply chain for smelting, both of which may resist the change presented by our AquaRefining process. Competition from such incumbents may come in the form of restricted access to used LABs. We believe that LAB manufacturers who also maintain their own smelting operations control approximately 50% of the market for used LABs. We will require access to used LABs at market prices in order to carry out our business plan. If those LAB manufacturers and others involved in the reverse supply chain for used LABs attempt to restrict our access to used LABs that may adversely affect our prospects and future growth. There can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively withstand the pressures applied by our competition.\nWe may experience significant fluctuations in raw material prices and the price of our principal product, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, growth prospects and results of operations.\u2003 Spent LAB\u2019s are our primary raw material and we believe that in recent years the cost of used LABS has been volatile at times. Our principal product, recycled lead, has also experienced price volatility from time to time as well. For example, the market price of lead on the London Metal Exchange, or LME, during 2015 and 2016 ranged from $1,554 to $2,456 per tonne. While we intend to pursue supply and tolling arrangements and hedge transactions as appropriate to offset any price volatility, the volatile nature of prices for used LABs and recycled lead could have an adverse impact on our liquidity, growth prospects and results of operations.\nThe global economic conditions could negatively affect our prospects for growth and operating results. Our prospects for growth and operating results will be directly affected by the general global economic conditions of the industries in which our suppliers, partners and customer groups operate. We believe that the market price of our principal product, recycled lead, is relatively volatile and reacts to general global economic conditions. Lead prices decreased from $2,139 per tonne on May 5, 2015 to a low of $1,554 per tonne on November 23, 2015 because of fluctuations in the market. A month later, the price per ton increased back up to $1,801 per ton; the price per tonne was $1,983 on December 31, 2016. Our business will be highly dependent on the economic and market conditions in each of the geographic areas in which we operate. These conditions affect our business by reducing the demand for LABs and decreasing the price of lead in times of economic down turn and increasing the price of used LABs in times of increasing demand of LABs and recycled lead. There can be no assurance that global economic conditions will not, at times, negatively impact our liquidity, growth prospects and results of operations.\nWe are subject to the risks of conducting business outside the United States. A part of our strategy involves our pursuit of growth opportunities in certain international market locations. We intend to pursue the development and ownership of recycling facilities in certain foreign jurisdictions, including Mexico, China and India, among others countries, however it is more likely that we will enter into licensing or joint venture arrangements with local partners who will be primarily responsible for the day-to-day operations. Any expansion outside of the US will require significant management attention and financial resources to successfully develop and operate any such facilities, including the sales, supply and support channels, and we cannot assure you that we will be successful or that our expenditures in this effort will not exceed the amount of any resulting revenues. Our international operations expose us to risks and challenges that we would otherwise not face if we conducted our business only in the United States, such as:\n\u2022 increased cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022 heightened price sensitivities from customers in emerging markets;\n\u2022 our ability to establish or contract for local manufacturing, support and service functions;\n\u2022 localization of our LABs and components, including translation into foreign languages and the associated expenses;\n\u2022 compliance with multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations;\n\u2022 foreign currency fluctuations;\n\u2022 laws favoring local competitors;\n\u2022 weaker legal protections of contract terms, enforcement on collection of receivables and intellectual property rights and mechanisms for enforcing those rights;\n\u2022 market disruptions created by public health crises in regions outside the United States;\n\u2022 difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, including challenges presented by relationships with workers\u2019 councils and labor unions;\n\u2022 issues related to differences in cultures and practices; and\n\u2022 changing regional economic, political and regulatory conditions.\nGovernment regulation and environmental, health and safety concerns may adversely affect our business. Our operations in the United States will be subject to the Federal, State and local environmental, health and safety laws applicable to the reclamation of lead acid batteries. Depending on how any particular operation is structured, our facilities may have to obtain environmental permits or approvals to operate, including those associated with air emissions, water discharges, and waste management and storage. We may face opposition from local residents or public interest groups to the installation and operation of our facilities. Failure to secure (or significant delays in securing) the necessary approvals could prevent us from pursuing some of our planned operations and adversely affect our business, financial results and growth prospects. In addition to permitting requirements, our operations are subject to environmental health, safety and transportation laws and regulations that govern the management of and exposure to hazardous materials such as the lead and acids involved in battery reclamation. These include hazard communication and other occupational safety requirements for employees, which may mandate industrial hygiene monitoring of employees for potential exposure to lead. Failure to comply with these requirements could subject our business to significant penalties (civil or criminal) and other sanctions that could adversely affect our business.\nThe nature of our operations involves risks, including the potential for exposure to hazardous materials such as lead, that could result in personal injury and property damage claims from third parties, including employees and neighbors, which claims could result in significant costs or other environmental liability. Our operations also pose a risk of releases of hazardous substances, such as lead or acids, into the environment, which can result in liabilities for the removal or remediation of such hazardous substances from the properties at which they have been released, liabilities which can be imposed regardless of fault, and our business could be held liable for the entire cost of cleanup even if we were only partially responsible. Like any manufacturer, we are also subject to the possibility that we may receive notices of potential liability in connection with materials that were sent to third-party recycling, treatment, and/or disposal facilities under the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (\u201cCERCLA\u201d), and comparable state statutes, which impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault or the legality of the conduct that contributed to the contamination, and for damages to natural resources. Liability under CERCLA is retroactive, and, under certain circumstances, liability for the entire cost of a cleanup can be imposed on any responsible party.\nAs our business expands outside of the United States, our operations will be subject to the environmental, health and safety laws of the countries where we do business, including permitting and compliance requirements that address the similar risks as do the laws in the United States, as well as international legal requirements such as those applicable to the transportation of hazardous materials. Depending on the country or region, these laws could be as stringent as those in the US, or they could be less stringent or not as strictly enforced. In some countries in which we are interested in expanding our business, such as Mexico and China, the relevant environmental regulatory and enforcement frameworks are in flux and subject to change. Compliance with these requirements will cause our business to incur costs, and failure to comply with these requirements could adversely affect our business.\nIn the event we are unable to present and operate our AquaRefining process and operations as safe and environmentally responsible, we may face opposition from local governments, residents or public interest groups to the installation and operation of our facilities.\nRisks Related to Owning Our Common Stock\nPrior to the completion of our initial public offering in July 2015, there was no public trading market for our common stock. Our common stock has traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market, under the symbol \u201cAQMS\u201d, since July 31, 2015. Since that date, our common stock has at times been relatively thinly traded. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully maintain a liquid market for our common shares. The stock market in general, and early stage public companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies. If we are unable to develop a market for our common shares, you may not be able to sell your common shares at prices you consider to be fair or at times that are convenient for you, or at all.\nControl by management may limit your ability to influence the outcome of director elections and other transactions requiring stockholder approval. As of February 28, 2017, our directors and executive officers beneficially own approximately 18.9% of our outstanding common stock. In addition, one other stockholder, Interstate Battery Systems International, Inc., beneficially owns an additional 16.6%. As a result, such persons acting together will have significant influence over corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including the following actions:\n\u2022 to elect or defeat the election of our directors;\n\u2022 to amend or prevent amendment of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws;\n\u2022 to effect or prevent a merger, sale of assets or other corporate transaction; and\n\u2022 to control the outcome of any other matter submitted to our stockholders for vote.\nSuch persons\u2019 stock ownership may discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company, which in turn could reduce our stock price or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over our stock price.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act of 2012 and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors. We are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (\u201cJOBS Act\u201d), and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to:\n\u2022 not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n\u2022 reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements;\n\u2022 exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments; and\n\u2022 extended transition periods available for complying with new or revised accounting standards.\nWe have chosen to \u201copt out\u201d of the extended transition periods available for complying with new or revised accounting standards, but we intend to take advantage of all of the other benefits available under the JOBS Act, including the exemptions discussed above. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to 2020, although we will lose that status sooner if our revenues exceed $1 billion, if we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three-year period, or if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30.\nOur status as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act may make it more difficult to raise capital as and when we need it. Because of the exemptions from various reporting requirements provided to us as an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we may be less attractive to investors and it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital as and when we need it. Investors may be unable to compare our business with other companies in our industry if they believe that our reporting is not as transparent as other companies in our industry. If we are unable to raise additional capital as and when we need it, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have not paid dividends in the past and have no immediate plans to pay dividends. We plan to reinvest all of our earnings, to the extent we have earnings, in order to develop our recycling centers and cover operating costs and to otherwise become and remain competitive. We do not plan to pay any cash dividends with respect to our securities in the foreseeable future. We cannot assure you that we would, at any time, generate sufficient surplus cash that would be available for distribution to the holders of our common stock as a dividend. Therefore, you should not expect to receive cash dividends on our common stock.\nShares eligible for future sale may adversely affect the market for our common stock. Of the 19,337,164 shares of our common stock outstanding as of the date of this report, approximately 14,234,184 shares are held by \u201cnon-affiliates\u201d and are freely tradable without restriction pursuant to Rule 144. In addition, in August 2016, we filed with the SEC a Registration Statement on Form S-3 for purposes of registering the resale of 4,431,205 share of restricted common stock sold in our May 2016 financing, including 3,009,625 shares of common stock issuable to Interstate Battery upon exercise of its warrants and conversion of its convertible note, and in February 2017, we filed with the SEC a Registration Statement on Form S-3 for purposes of registering the resale of the 939,005 shares of restricted common stock we sold to Johnson Controls in February 2017. Any substantial sale of our common stock pursuant to Rule 144 or pursuant to any resale prospectus may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nOur charter documents and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover that stockholders consider favorable. Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and applicable provisions of Delaware law may delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in control or change in our management, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares, or transactions that our stockholders might otherwise deem to be in their best interests. The provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws:\n\u2022 limit who may call stockholder meetings;\n\u2022 do not permit stockholders to act by written consent;\n\u2022 do not provide for cumulative voting rights; and\n\u2022 provide that all vacancies may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may limit our ability to engage in any business combination with a person who beneficially owns 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock unless certain conditions are satisfied. This restriction lasts for a period of three years following the share acquisition. These provisions may have the effect of entrenching our management team and may deprive you of the opportunity to sell your shares to potential acquirers at a premium over prevailing prices. This potential inability to obtain a control premium could reduce the price of our common stock.\nOur bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with the Company. Our bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us or any our directors, officers or other employees arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or our certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us or any our directors, officers or other employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This forum selection provision in our bylaws may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or any our directors, officers or other employees.", "PERMNO": 15493, "SIC": 4953, "TIC": "AQMS"}
