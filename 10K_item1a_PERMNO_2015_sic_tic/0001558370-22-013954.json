{"cik": "57725", "company": "LANNETT CO INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-08-25", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS\nOperational and Industry-specific Risks\nThe generic pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive.\nWe face strong competition in our generic product business. Revenues and gross profit derived from the sales of generic pharmaceutical products tend to follow a pattern based on certain regulatory and competitive factors.\nTypically, as patents for brand-name products and related exclusivity periods expire or fall under patent challenges, the first generic manufacturer to receive regulatory approval for generic equivalents of such products is generally able to achieve significant market penetration. As competing off-patent manufacturers receive regulatory approvals on similar products or as brand manufacturers launch generic versions of such products (for which no separate regulatory approval is required), market share, revenues and gross profit typically decline, in some cases dramatically. Accordingly, the level of market share, revenue and gross profit attributable to a particular generic product is normally related to the number of competitors in that product\u2019s market and the timing of that product\u2019s regulatory approval and launch, in relation to competing approvals and launches. Consequently, we must continue to develop and introduce new products in a timely and cost-effective manner to maintain our revenues and gross margins.\nIf we are unable to successfully develop or commercialize new products on a timely basis, our revenues, gross margins and operating results will suffer.\nOur future results of operations will depend to a significant extent upon our ability to successfully commercialize new generic products in a timely manner. There are numerous difficulties in developing and commercializing new products, including developing, testing and manufacturing products in compliance with regulatory standards in a timely manner; receiving requisite regulatory approvals for such products in a timely manner; the availability, on commercially reasonable terms, of raw materials, including APIs and other key ingredients; developing and commercializing a new product is time consuming, costly and subject to numerous factors that may delay or prevent the successful commercialization of new products; and commercializing generic products may be substantially delayed by unexpired patents covering the brand drug.\nAs a result of these and other difficulties, products currently in development by Lannett may or may not receive the regulatory approvals necessary for marketing. If any of our products, when developed and approved, cannot be successfully or timely commercialized, our revenue, gross margins and operating results could be adversely affected. We cannot guarantee that any investment we make in developing products will be recouped, even if we are successful in commercializing those products.\nWe have and will continue to enter into strategic alliances and collaborations with third parties, including companies based outside of the U.S., for the commercialization of some of our drug candidates. If those collaborations are not successful, we may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of these drug candidates.\nWe previously have and will continue in the future to seek third-party collaborators for the commercialization of some of our drug candidates on a selected basis, which adds a level of complexity to our supply network. If we do enter into any such arrangements with any third parties, we will likely have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators dedicate to the development of our drug candidates. Our ability to generate revenues from these arrangements will depend on our collaborators\u2019 abilities and efforts to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements. Many risks associated with relying on third-party collaborators for developing new products are beyond our control. For example, some of our collaboration partners may decide to make substantial changes to a product\u2019s formulation or design, may experience supply interruptions or financial difficulties or may have limited financial resources. Any of the foregoing may delay the development of new products or interrupt their market supply. In addition, if a third-party collaborator on a new product terminates our collaboration agreement or does not perform under the agreement, we may experience delays and additional costs in developing or replacing that product.\nIn addition, Lannett has multiple collaborations with partners outside of the U.S. and is subject to certain risks associated with having partners\u2019 operations located in foreign jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict the impact of geopolitical risks or other factors that may interrupt supply, regulatory approval and new product launches. Disruptions in our partners\u2019 operations or any deterioration in the geopolitical environment as a result of the above risks or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe development, approval process, manufacture and commercialization of biosimilar products involve unique challenges and uncertainties, and our failure to successfully introduce biosimilar products could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe and our partners and suppliers are actively working to develop and commercialize biosimilar products, including biosimilar Insulin Glargine and biosimilar Insulin Aspart. Although the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (\u201cBPCIA\u201d) established a framework for the review and approval of biosimilar products and the FDA has begun to review and approve biosimilar product applications, there continues to be uncertainty regarding the regulatory pathway in the U.S., with the FDA continuing to issue and revise guidance related to its interpretation and implementation of the BPCIA. If we are unable to obtain FDA or other non-U.S. regulatory authority approval for our products, we will be unable to market them. Access to and the supply of necessary biological materials may be limited, and government regulations restrict access to and regulate the transport and use of such materials.\nEven if our biosimilar products are approved for marketing, the products may not be commercially successful, may require more time than expected to achieve market acceptance, and may not generate profits in amounts that are sufficient to offset the amount invested to obtain such approvals. Market success of biosimilar products will depend on demonstrating to regulators, patients, physicians and payors (such as insurance companies) that such products are safe and effective and yet offer a more competitive price or other benefit over existing therapies. In addition, manufacturers of biologic products may try to dissuade physicians from prescribing or accepting biosimilar products. If our development efforts do not result in the development and timely approval of biosimilar products or if such products, once developed and approved, are not commercially successful, or if any of the above risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to obtain sufficient supplies from key suppliers that in some cases may be the only source of finished products or raw materials, our ability to deliver our products to the market may be impeded.\nWe are required to identify the supplier(s) of all the raw materials for our products in our applications with the FDA. To the extent practicable, we attempt to identify more than one supplier in each drug application. However, some products and raw materials are available only from a single source and, in some of our drug applications, only one supplier of products and raw materials has been identified, even in instances where multiple sources exist. To the extent any difficulties experienced by our suppliers cannot be resolved within a reasonable time and at reasonable cost, or if raw materials for a particular product become unavailable from an approved supplier and we are required to qualify a new supplier with the FDA, our profit margins and market share for the affected product could decrease and our development and sales and marketing efforts could be delayed.\nOur policies regarding returns, allowances and chargebacks and marketing programs adopted by wholesalers may reduce our revenues in future fiscal periods.\nConsistent with industry practice, the Company establishes provisions for chargebacks, rebates, returns and other adjustments to gross sales. The provisions are primarily estimated based on historical experience, future expectations, contractual arrangements with wholesalers and indirect customers and other factors known to management at the time of accrual. However, we cannot ensure that our reserves are adequate or that actual product returns, allowances and chargebacks will not exceed our estimates.\nHealth care initiatives and other third-party payor cost-containment pressures have and could continue to cause us to sell our products at lower prices, resulting in decreased revenues.\nSome of our products are purchased or reimbursed by state and federal government authorities, private health insurers and other organizations, such as health maintenance organizations, or HMOs, and managed care organizations, or MCOs. Third-party payors increasingly challenge pharmaceutical product pricing. There also continues to be a trend toward managed health care in the United States. Pricing pressures by third-party payors and the growth of organizations such as HMOs and MCOs could result in lower prices and a reduction in demand for our products.\nOne such governmental program, known as the 340B Program, requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into an agreement, called a pharmaceutical pricing agreement (\u201cPPA\u201d), with the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Under the PPA, the manufacturer agrees to provide front-end discounts on covered outpatient drugs purchased by specified providers, called \u201ccovered entities,\u201d that serve the nation\u2019s most vulnerable patient populations. Outpatient prescription drugs, over the counter drugs (accompanied by a prescription), and clinic-administered drugs within eligible facilities are covered.\nIn addition, legislative and regulatory proposals and enactments to reform health care and government insurance programs could significantly influence the manner in which pharmaceutical products and medical devices are prescribed and purchased. We expect there will continue to be federal and state laws and/or regulations, proposed and implemented, that could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for health care products and services. The extent to which future legislation or regulations, if any, relating to the health care industry or third-party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted or what effect such legislation or regulation would have on our business remains uncertain. Since its enactment, there have been numerous judicial, administrative, executive, and legislative challenges to certain aspects of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\u201cACA\u201d), and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. Additionally, the Trump administration issued various Executive Orders which eliminated cost sharing subsidies and various provisions that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. Finally, Congress has introduced several pieces of legislation aimed at significantly revising or repealing the ACA. Although a number of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, and the Biden administration has reverse some of these measures, Congress has indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative measures to control drug costs. It is unclear whether the ACA will be overturned, repealed, replaced, or further amended, and how or whether it may affect our business in the future. We expect that changes to the ACA, the Medicare and Medicaid programs, changes allowing the federal government to directly negotiate drug prices and changes stemming from other healthcare reform measures, especially with regard to healthcare access, financing or other legislation in individual states, could have a material adverse effect on the healthcare industry and on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or our stock price operations.\nSales of our products may continue to be adversely affected by the continuing consolidation of our distribution network and the concentration of our customer base.\nOur principal customers are wholesale drug distributors, major retail drug store chains and mail order pharmacies. These customers comprise a significant part of the distribution network for pharmaceutical products in the U.S. This distribution network has undergone significant consolidation marked by mergers and acquisitions among wholesale distributors and the growth of large retail drug store chains. As a result, a small number of large wholesale distributors control a significant share of the market and the number of independent drug stores and small drug store chains has decreased. We expect that consolidation of drug wholesalers and retailers will increase pricing and other competitive pressures on drug manufacturers, including Lannett.\nOur net sales may also be affected by fluctuations in the buying patterns of retail chains, mail order distributors, wholesalers and other trade buyers, whether resulting from pricing, wholesaler buying decisions or other factors.\nOur three largest customers accounted for 24%, 19% and 14%, respectively, of our total net sales for Fiscal 2022 and 27%, 21% and 12%, respectively, of our total net sales for Fiscal 2021. The loss of any of these customers, any financial difficulties experienced by any of these customers or any delay in receiving payments from such customers could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition and our cash flows. In addition, the Company generally does not enter into long-term supply agreements with its customers that would require them to purchase our products.\nWe expend resources on research and development efforts that may not lead to successful product introductions.\nWe conduct R&D primarily to enable us to gain approval for, manufacture, and market pharmaceuticals in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. We also partner with third parties to develop products. We cannot be certain that any investment made in developing products will be recovered, even if we are successful in commercialization. To the extent that we expend significant resources on R&D efforts and are not able, ultimately, to introduce successful new and/or complex products as a result of those efforts, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or the price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness\nOur substantial indebtedness may adversely affect our financial health.\nWe have substantial indebtedness. As of June 30, 2022, we had total indebtedness of $654.0 million, including $350.0 million of 7.75% senior secured notes (the \u201cNotes\u201d), the $190.0 million Second Lien Secured Loan Facility (the \u201cSecond Lien Facility\u201d) and $86.3 million aggregate principal amount of 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes (the \u201cConvertible\nNotes\u201d). We also have access to $43.4 million on the Amended ABL Credit Facility as of June 30, 2022, which includes use of the facility for letters of credit.\nOur substantial indebtedness may have important consequences for us. For example, it may make it more difficult for us to make payments on our indebtedness; increase our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions, including recessions and periods of significant inflation and financial market volatility; expose us to the risk of increased interest rates because any borrowings we make under the Amended ABL Credit Facility will bear interest at variable rates; require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other expenses; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; increase our cost of future borrowing; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness; and limit our ability to borrow additional funds that may be needed to operate and expand our business.\nThe agreements and instruments governing our debt, contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business.\nThe operating and financial restrictions and covenants in the agreements and instruments that govern our indebtedness restrict, and future debt instruments may restrict, subject to certain important exceptions and qualifications, our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things, incur or guarantee indebtedness; grant or permit liens on our assets; pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our capital stock; make investments or acquisitions; prepay, repurchase or redeem certain other indebtedness; sell or otherwise transfer assets, including capital stock of our subsidiaries; merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; enter into transactions with our affiliates; grant or permit dividend or other payment restrictions affecting certain of our subsidiaries; and change the business we conduct or enter into new lines of business.\nIn addition, the Amended ABL Credit Facility includes a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of no less than 1.10 to 1.00, which is tested only when excess availability is less than 15.0% of the lesser of (A) the borrowing base and (B) the then effective commitments under the Amended ABL Credit Facility for three consecutive business days, and continuing until the first day immediately succeeding the last day of 30 consecutive days on which Excess Availability is in excess of such threshold, and the Second Lien Credit Facility requires us to maintain at least $5.0 million in a deposit account subject at all times to control by the collateral agent for the Second Lien Lenders, and minimum liquidity of $15.0 million as of the last day of each month. These covenants could adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs, withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general, engage in business activities, including future opportunities that may be in our interest, and plan for or react to market conditions or otherwise execute our business strategies. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default in respect of the related indebtedness. If a default occurs, the relevant lenders or holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare the indebtedness, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable and proceed against any collateral securing that indebtedness. Acceleration of our other indebtedness could result in a default under the terms of the agreements that govern the Amended ABL Credit Facility and the Second Lien Credit Facility or the indentures governing the 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes and the Senior Notes. There is no guarantee that we would be able to satisfy our obligations if any of our indebtedness is accelerated.\nIn addition, the limitations that are imposed in the agreements that govern the Amended ABL Credit Facility and the Second Lien Credit Facility on our ability to incur certain additional debt and to take other corporate actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing. If, for any reason, we are unable to comply with the restrictions in the agreements that govern the Amended ABL Credit Facility and the Second Lien Credit Facility, we may not be granted waivers or amendments to such restrictions or we may not be able to refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us, or at all. The lenders under the Amended ABL Credit Facility also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. If we were unable to pay such amounts, the lenders under the Amended ABL Credit Facility and the Second Lien Credit Facility could recover amounts owed to them by foreclosing against the collateral pledged to them.\nDue to many factors beyond our control, we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and meet our other ongoing liquidity needs and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our debt agreements, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make payments on, and to refinance, our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nOur business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, and we may not have available to us future borrowings in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. In these circumstances, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness or obtain additional financing will depend on, among other things, our financial condition at the time; restrictions in the agreements governing our indebtedness, and the condition of the financial markets and the industry in which we operate.\nAs a result, we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In such a case, we could be forced to sell assets, reduce or delay capital expenditures or issue equity securities to make up for any shortfall in our payment obligations under unfavorable circumstances. The terms of the indentures that govern the 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes and the Senior Notes and the agreements that govern the Amended ABL Credit Facility and the Second Lien Credit Facility limit our ability to sell assets. In addition, we may not be able to sell assets quickly enough or for sufficient amounts to enable us to meet our obligations. Any failure to make scheduled payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness when due would permit the holders of such indebtedness to declare an event of default and accelerate the indebtedness, which in turn could lead to cross defaults under the instruments governing our other indebtedness. This could result in the lenders under the agreement that governs the Amended ABL Credit Facility terminating their commitments to lend us money and could result in the lenders under the agreement that governs the Amended ABL Credit Facility and the Second Lien Credit Facility foreclosing against the assets securing such facilities, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or other insolvency proceedings. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on acceptable terms.\nRisks Related to our Financial Condition and Results\nOur gross profit may fluctuate from period to period depending upon our product sales mix, our product pricing and our costs to manufacture or purchase products.\nOur future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows depend to a significant extent upon our product sales mix. Sales of certain products that we manufacture tend to create higher gross margins than the products we purchase and resell. As a result, our sales mix will significantly impact our gross profit from period to period.\nFactors that may cause our sales mix to vary include the number of new product introductions; marketing exclusivity, if any, which may be obtained on certain new products; the level of competition in the marketplace for certain products; the availability of raw materials and finished products from our suppliers; and the scope and outcome of governmental regulatory action that may involve us.\nThe Company is continuously seeking to keep product costs low, however there can be no guarantee that gross profit percentages will stay consistent in future periods. Pricing pressure from competitors, changes in product mix and the costs of producing or purchasing new drugs may also fluctuate in future periods.\nA relatively small group of products may represent a significant portion of our revenues, gross profit, or net earnings from time to time.\nSales of a limited number of our products from time to time represent a significant portion of our revenues, gross profit and net earnings. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, our top five products in terms of sales, in the aggregate, represented approximately 30%, 36% and 45%, respectively, of our total net sales. If the volume or pricing of our largest selling products decline in the future, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or share price could be materially adversely affected. See \u201cDescription of Business\u201d above for more information on our top products.\nOur tax returns and positions are subject to review and audit by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, and any adverse outcomes resulting from any examination of our tax returns could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.\nThe positions taken in our U.S. federal, state and local income tax return filings require significant judgments and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Our income tax returns are subject to examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The Company\u2019s Fiscal 2015 through 2017, 2019, 2020 and 2021 federal returns are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d). For additional details on the returns under audit, see Note 16 \u201cIncome Taxes.\u201d While we believe our tax return positions are proper and supportable, certain positions could be successfully challenged. An unfavorable outcome of any current or future tax audit could result in our need to utilize available cash to satisfy such tax liabilities and any interest or penalties thereon rather than for our business operations. As a result, the occurrence of an unfavorable outcome with respect to any future tax audit could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.\nWe may incur additional tax liabilities related to our operations.\nWe are subject to income tax in the United States. We record liabilities for uncertain tax positions that involve significant management judgment as to the application of law. Our effective tax rate may also be adversely affected by numerous other factors, including changes in tax laws and regulations, and tax effects of the accounting for stock-based compensation (which depend in part on the price of our stock and, therefore, are beyond our control). The potential for U.S. tax law changes exists, including as a result of proposals to increase the income tax rate. Increases to the income tax rate or other changes to the tax law could materially impact our tax provision, cash tax liability, and effective tax rate. The pressure to generate tax revenue to offset economic relief measures due to the COVID-19 pandemic could increase the likelihood of adverse tax law changes being enacted. If changes in U.S. federal and applicable state income tax laws increase our U.S. federal or state income tax liability, we will be obligated to pay such increased U.S. federal and state income tax liability which would reduce our cash available for business operations. Changes to or the imposition of new U.S. federal, state, or local taxes could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.\nIf our intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\nUnder U.S. GAAP, we review our intangible assets for impairment if a triggering event occurs, which would indicate a potential change in market conditions or future outlook of value. We may be required to record additional significant charges to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our intangible assets is determined, resulting in a negative effect on our results of operations. Changes in market conditions or other changes in the future outlook of value may lead to further impairments in the future. In addition, we continue to review the potential divestment of certain assets as part of our future plans, which may lead to additional impairments. Future events or decisions may lead to asset impairments and/or related charges. For assets that are not impaired, we may adjust the remaining useful lives. Certain non-cash impairments may result from a change in our strategic goals, business direction or other factors relating to the overall business environment. Any significant impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nIf we cannot regain compliance with the New York Stock Exchange\u2019s (the \u201cNYSE\u201d) continued listing requirements and rules, the NYSE may delist our stock, which could negatively affect our company, the price of our common stock and our shareholders\u2019 ability to sell out common stock and may lead to potential events of default on existing debt instruments.\nOn March 2, 2022, we received notice from the NYSE that we were no longer in compliance with the NYSE continued listing standards, set forth in Section 802.01B of the NYSE\u2019s Listed Company Manual, because the Company\u2019s average global market capitalization over a consecutive 30 trading-day period was less than $50.0 million and, at the same time, our shareholders\u2019 equity was less than $50.0 million. If the Company\u2019s average global market capitalization over a consecutive 30 trading-day period drops below $15.0 million, the NYSE will initiate delisting proceedings. As of July 31, 2022, the 30 trading-day average global market capitalization of the Company was approximately $25.4 million, and the Company\u2019s absolute market capitalization was approximately $25.0 million. In accordance with the NYSE listing requirements, we submitted a plan that demonstrates how we expect to return to compliance with Section 802.01B within 18 months. On May 26, 2022, the Company received notice from the NYSE that the plan was accepted. The NYSE will be performing quarterly reviews during the 18 months from the Company\u2019s receipt of the First Notice for\ncompliance with the goals and initiatives as outlined in the Company\u2019s plan. Failure to satisfy the requisite goals or initiatives may result in the Company being subject to NYSE trading suspension at that time. The Company is required to achieve the minimum continued listing standards of either average global market capitalization over a consecutive 30 trading-day period of $50.0 million or total stockholders' equity of $50.0 million at the completion of the 18-month plan period, and failure to achieve any of the minimum requirements at the end of the 18-month period may result in the Company being suspended by the NYSE, which may make an application to the SEC to delist the Company\u2019s Common Stock. There can be no assurances that the Company will maintain compliance with the plan.\nIn addition, on March 14, 2022, the Company received notice by the NYSE that it was not in compliance with the continued listing standard set forth in Section 802.01C of the NYSE\u2019s Listed Company Manual because the average closing price of the Company\u2019s common stock was less than $1.00 per share over a consecutive 30 trading-day period. In order to regain compliance, on the last trading day of any calendar month during the cure period or on the last business day of the six-month cure period, the Company\u2019s shares of common stock must demonstrate (i) a closing price of at least $1.00 per share and (ii) an average closing share price of at least $1.00 over the 30 trading-day period ending on such date. The Company intends to cure the deficiency within a period permissible under Section 802.01C of the NYSE\u2019s Listed Company Manual. However, there can be no assurances that the Company will meet continued listing standards within the specified cure period.\nIf we are unable to satisfy the NYSE criteria for continued listing, our common stock would be subject to delisting. A delisting of our common stock could negatively impact us by, among other things, reducing the liquidity and market price of our common stock; reducing the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock, which could negatively impact our ability to raise equity financing; decreasing the amount of news and analyst coverage of the Company; limiting our ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future; and leading to the acceleration of our debt maturities, which would put additional pressure on our liquidity and ability to continue to operate as a going concern. If the Company ceases to be listed or quoted on any of The NYSE, The Nasdaq Global Select Market or The Nasdaq Global Market (or any of their respective successors), holders of the outstanding Convertible Notes will have the option to require the Company to repurchase for cash all of such holder\u2019s notes at 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, delisting from the NYSE may negatively impact our reputation and, consequently, our business.\nGovernmental investigations into sales and marketing practices in the generic pharmaceutical industry and claims by private parties relating to such investigations may result in substantial penalties or settlements.\nThere has been increased press coverage and increased scrutiny from regulatory and enforcement agencies and legislative bodies with respect to matters relating to the pricing of generic pharmaceuticals, including publicity and pressure resulting from prices charged by our competitors. We have experienced and may continue to experience downward pricing pressure on the price of our products due to competitive pressure to lower the cost of drugs to the ultimate consumer, which could reduce our revenue and future profitability. This increased press coverage and public scrutiny have resulted in, and may continue to result in, investigations, and calls for investigations, by governmental agencies at both the federal and state level and have resulted in, and may continue to result in, claims brought against us by private parties or by regulators taking other measures that could have a negative effect on our business. For a description of current, federal, and state investigations and claims by private parties, see Note 10 \u201cLegal, Regulatory Matters and Contingencies.\u201d Additional actions are possible. Responding to such investigations and claims is costly and involves a significant diversion of management attention. Such proceedings are unpredictable and may develop over lengthy periods of time. Future settlements may involve large monetary penalties. It is not possible at this time to predict the ultimate outcome of any such investigations or claims or what other investigations or lawsuits or regulatory responses may result from such assertions, or their impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or our stock price. Any such investigation or claim could also result in reputational harm and reduced market acceptance and demand for our products, could harm our ability to market our products in the future, could cause us to incur significant expense, could cause our senior management to be distracted from execution of our business strategy, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. Accompanying the press and media coverage of pharmaceutical pricing practices and public complaints about the same, there has been increasing U.S. federal and state legislative and enforcement interest with respect to drug pricing. In recent years, both the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate have conducted numerous hearings with respect to pharmaceutical drug pricing practices, including in connection with the investigation of specific price increases by pharmaceutical companies, designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing,\nreview the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient support programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. Any proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, and it is uncertain whether Congress or the Biden administration will seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. The Biden administration has indicated that lowering drug prices continues to be a legislative and political priority. In addition to the effects of any investigations or claims brought against us described above, our revenue and future profitability could also be negatively affected if any such inquiries, of us or of other pharmaceutical companies or the industry more generally, were to result in legislative or regulatory proposals that limit our ability to increase the prices of our products. Any of the events or developments described above could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations, as well as on our reputation.\nThe recent enactment of Federal and State laws affecting the pricing of our products could have the effect of reducing our profitability.\nSince 2016, several state legislatures have enacted laws regulating the pricing of various types of pharmaceutical products, including generic pharmaceutical products. These laws vary in applicability and scope, and generally require manufacturers to notify various state agencies of price increases over a given threshold for a given period of time, to include a justification for any price increases, and to provide price transparency. At least one state law (subsequently struck down by the court) authorized the state attorney general to seek civil penalties and disgorgement in the event a price increase is deemed unconscionable. To the extent these laws apply to our products, they could limit the prices which the company may charge for its products and reduce the company\u2019s profitability and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nOn August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 into law. This legislation contains substantial drug pricing reforms, including the establishment of a drug price negotiation program within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that would require manufacturers to charge a negotiated \u201cmaximum fair price\u201d for certain selected drugs or pay an excise tax for noncompliance, the establishment of rebate payment requirements on manufacturers of certain drugs payable under Medicare Parts B and D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation, and requires manufacturers to provide discounts on Part D drugs. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 also caps Medicare beneficiaries\u2019 annual out-of-pocket drug expenses at $2,000 and caps Medicare beneficiaries\u2019 monthly insulin costs at $35. Additional drug pricing proposals could appear in future legislation. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 could have the effect of reducing the prices we can charge and reimbursement we receive for our products, thereby reducing our profitability, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. The effect of Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 on our business and the generic pharmaceutical industry in general is not yet known.\nExtensive industry regulation has had and will continue to have, a significant impact on our business in the area of cost of goods, especially our product development, manufacturing and distribution capabilities.\nAll pharmaceutical companies, including Lannett, are subject to extensive, complex, costly and evolving regulation by the federal government, including the FDA and, in the case of controlled drugs, the DEA and state government agencies. The Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the \u201cFDCA\u201d), the Controlled Substance Act (the \u201cCSA\u201d) and other federal statutes, regulations and guidance govern or influence the development, testing, manufacturing, packing, labeling, storing, record keeping, safety, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of our products.\nThe process for obtaining governmental approval to manufacture and market pharmaceutical products is rigorous, time-consuming and costly and we cannot predict the extent to which we may be affected by legislative and regulatory developments. We are dependent on receiving FDA and other governmental or third-party approvals prior to manufacturing, marketing and shipping our products. The FDA approval process for a particular product candidate can take several years and requires us to dedicate substantial resources to complete all activities necessary to secure approvals and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates in a timely manner, or at all. In order to obtain approval of ANDAs for our generic product candidates, we must demonstrate that our drug product is therapeutically equivalent and bioequivalent to a drug previously approved by the FDA through the drug approval process, known as the RLD or reference standard drug (\u201cRS\u201d). Bioequivalence may be demonstrated in vivo or in vitro by comparing the generic product candidate to the innovator drug product. Approval of our drug products that vary in certain ways from a brand name version of that drug may require a different FDA review process and application known as a 505(b)(2) NDA. Such 505(b)(2) applications may require costly human clinical studies which may extend the time\nfor approval of such drug product. Moreover, the FDA may request additional information and studies to support approval of an application, which could delay approval of the product and impair our ability to compete with other versions of the generic drug product.\nConsequently, there is always the chance that we will not obtain FDA or other necessary approvals, or that the rate, timing and cost of such approvals will adversely affect our product introduction plans or results of operations. We carry inventories of certain products in anticipation of launch and if such products are not subsequently launched, we may be required to write-off the related inventory. Furthermore, the FDA also has the authority to withdraw drug approvals previously granted after a hearing and require a firm to remove these products from the market for a variety of reasons, including a failure to comply with applicable regulations or the discovery of previously unknown safety problems with the product.\nWe cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action. The policies and priorities of the Biden administration could materially impact the regulations governing our product candidates. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may be subject to enforcement action and there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or the price of our common stock.\nIn addition, facilities used to manufacture and/or test materials and drug products we market are subject to periodic inspection of facilities by the FDA, the DEA and other authorities to confirm that firms are in compliance with all applicable regulations. The FDA conducts pre-approval and/or post-approval inspections to determine whether systems and processes are in compliance with cGMP and other FDA regulations. A Form 483 notice is generally issued at the conclusion of a FDA inspection and lists conditions the FDA inspectors believe may violate cGMP or other FDA regulations. If more serious violations are identified, the FDA may take additional action, such as issuing warning letters, import alerts, etc. The DEA and comparable state-level agencies also heavily regulate the manufacturing, holding, processing, security, record-keeping and distribution of drugs that are controlled substances. Lannett manufactures and/or distributes a variety of controlled substances. The DEA periodically inspects facilities for compliance with its regulations. If our manufacturing facilities or those of our suppliers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it could result in regulatory action and additional costs. All of our facilities as well as applicable contract/supplier facilities, rely on maintaining current FDA registration and other licenses to produce and develop generic drugs. If the Company does not successfully renew its FDA registrations, the financial results of Lannett would be negatively impacted. We and our third-party manufacturers are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA to assure regulatory compliance regarding the manufacturing, distribution, and promotion of pharmaceutical products. The FDA imposes stringent mandatory requirements on the manufacture and distribution of pharmaceutical products to ensure their safety and efficacy. If we or our partners receive similar notices of manufacturing and quality-related observations and correspondence in the future, and if we are unable to resolve these observations and address the FDA\u2019s concerns in a timely fashion, our business, financial results and/or stock price could be materially affected.\nOur inability or the inability of our suppliers to comply with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements can result in, among other things, delays in or denials of new product approvals, warning letters, import alerts, fines, consent decrees restricting or suspending manufacturing operations, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of sales and/or criminal prosecution. Any of these or other regulatory actions could materially harm our operating results and financial condition. Although we have instituted internal compliance programs, if these programs do not meet regulatory agency standards or if compliance is deemed deficient in any significant way, it could materially harm our business. Additionally, if the FDA were to undertake additional enforcement activities with Lannett\u2019s Grandfathered products, their actions could result in, among other things, removal of some products from the market, seizure of the product and total or partial suspension of sales. Any of these regulatory actions could materially harm our operating results and financial condition.\nIf brand pharmaceutical companies are successful in limiting the use of generics through their legislative and regulatory efforts, our sales of generic products may suffer.\nMany brand pharmaceutical companies have increasingly used state and federal legislative and regulatory means to delay generic competition. These efforts have included pursuing new patents for existing products which may be granted just before the expiration of one patent, which could extend patent protection for additional years or otherwise delay the launch of generics; using the Citizen Petition process to request amendments to FDA standards; seeking changes to U.S.\nPharmacopeia, an organization which publishes industry recognized compendia of drug standards; attaching patent extension amendments to non-related federal legislation; engaging in state-by-state initiatives to enact legislation that restricts the substitution of some generic drugs, which could have an impact on products that we are developing; persuading regulatory bodies to withdraw the approval of brand-name drugs for which the patents are about to expire and converting the market to another product of the brand company on which longer patent protection exists; limiting the availability of certain RLDs, with Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (\u201cREMS\u201d) distribution requirements, to generic companies for bioequivalence testing required for ANDA premarket approval for commercialization; entering into agreements whereby other generic companies will begin to market an AG, a generic equivalent of a branded product, at the same time or after generic competition initially enters the market; filing suits for patent infringement and other claims that may delay or prevent regulatory approval, manufacture and/or scale of generic products; and, introducing \u201cnext-generation\u201d products prior to the expiration of market exclusivity for the reference product, which often materially reduces the demand for the generic or the reference product for which we seek regulatory approval.\nIn the U.S., some pharmaceutical companies have lobbied Congress for amendments to the Hatch-Waxman Act that would give them additional advantages over generic competitors. For example, although the term of a company\u2019s drug patent can be extended to reflect a portion of the time an NDA is under regulatory review, some companies have proposed extending the patent term by a full year for each year spent in clinical trials rather than the one-half year that is currently permitted.\nIf proposals like these were to become effective, or if any other actions by our competitors and other third parties to prevent or delay activities necessary to the approval, manufacture, or distribution of our products are successful, our entry into the market and our ability to generate revenues associated with new products may be delayed, reduced, or eliminated, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or share price.\nThe generic pharmaceutical industry is characterized by intellectual property litigation and third parties may claim that we infringe on their proprietary rights, which could result in litigation that could be costly, result in the diversion of management\u2019s time and efforts, require us to pay damages or prevent us from marketing our existing or future products.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on not infringing or violating the intellectual property rights of others. The manufacture, use and sale of new products that are the subject of conflicting patent rights have been the subject of substantial litigation in the pharmaceutical industry. These lawsuits relate to the validity and infringement of patents or proprietary rights of third parties. We may have to defend against charges that we violated patents or proprietary rights of third parties. This is especially true in the case of generic products on which the patent covering the brand product is expiring, an area where infringement litigation is prevalent and in the case of new brand products in which a competitor has obtained patents for similar products. Our competitors, some of which have substantially greater resources than we do and have made substantial intellectual property investments in competing technologies, may have applied for or obtained, or may in the future apply for and obtain, patent rights and other intellectual property that will prevent, limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make, use and sell our products. We may not be aware of whether our products do or will infringe existing or future patents or the intellectual property rights of others. In addition, patent applications can be pending for many years and may be confidential for a number of months after filing and because pending patent claims can be revised before issuance, there may be applications of others now pending of which we are unaware that may later result in issued patents that will prevent, limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make, use or sell our products. Even if we prevail, litigation may be costly and time-consuming and could divert the attention of our management and technical personnel. Any potential intellectual property litigation also could force us to stop making, selling or using products or technologies that allegedly infringe the asserted intellectual property; lose the opportunity to license our technology to others or to collect royalty payments based upon successful protection and assertion of our intellectual property rights against others; incur significant legal expenses; pay substantial damages or royalties to the party whose intellectual property rights we may be found to be infringing; pay the attorney fees and costs of litigation to the party whose intellectual property rights we may be found to be infringing; redesign or rename, in the case of trademark claims, those products that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property, which could be costly, disruptive and/or infeasible; or attempt to obtain a license to the relevant intellectual property from third parties, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all.\nAny litigation or claim against us, even those without merit, may cause us to incur substantial costs and could place a significant strain on our financial resources, divert the attention of management from our core business and harm our\nreputation. If we are found to infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, we could be required to pay substantial damages and/or substantial royalties and could be prevented from selling our products unless we obtain a license or are able to redesign our products to avoid infringement. If we fail to obtain any required licenses or make any necessary changes to our products or technologies, we may have to withdraw existing products from the market or may be unable to commercialize one or more of our products, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAlthough the parties to patent and intellectual property disputes in the pharmaceutical industry have often settled their disputes through licensing or similar arrangements, the costs associated with these arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties. Any such license may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all, and there can be no assurance that we would be able to redesign our products in a way that would not infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Even if we were able to obtain rights to the third-party\u2019s intellectual property, these rights may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same intellectual property. As a result, an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling a number of our products or force us to redesign or rename our products to avoid infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties, which, even if it is possible to so redesign or rename our products, could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur reporting and payment obligations related to our participation in U.S. federal healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and the Department of Veterans Affairs, are complex and often involve subjective decisions that could change as a result of new business circumstances, new regulations or agency guidance, or advice of legal counsel. Any failure to comply with those obligations could subject us to investigation, penalties, and sanctions.\nU.S. federal laws regarding reporting and payment obligations with respect to a pharmaceutical company\u2019s participation in federal healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and the Department of Veterans Affairs (\u201cVA\u201d), are complex. Because our processes for calculating applicable government prices and the judgments involved in making these calculations involve subjective decisions and complex methodologies, these calculations are subject to risk of errors and differing interpretations. In addition, they are subject to review and challenge by the applicable governmental agencies, and it is possible that such reviews could result in changes that may have material adverse legal, regulatory, or economic consequences.\nAny governmental agencies or authorities that have commenced, or may commence, an investigation of us relating to the sales, marketing, pricing, quality, or manufacturing of pharmaceutical products could seek to impose, based on a claim of violation of anti-fraud and false claims laws or otherwise, civil and/or criminal sanctions, including fines, penalties, and possible exclusion from federal healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and/or the VA. Some of the applicable laws may impose liability even in the absence of specific intent to defraud. Furthermore, should there be ambiguity with regard to how to properly calculate and report payments-and even in the absence of any such ambiguity-a governmental authority may take a position contrary to a position we have taken, and may impose or pursue civil and/or criminal sanctions. Governmental agencies may also make changes in program interpretations, requirements or conditions of participation, some of which may have implications for amounts previously estimated or paid. There can be no assurance that our submissions will not be found to be incomplete or incorrect by Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services or the VA. Any failure to comply with the above laws and regulations, and any such penalties or sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or stock price.\nWe may need to change our business practices to comply with changes to fraud and abuse laws.\nWe are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including the federal Medicare and Medicaid AKS, which apply to our sales and marketing practices and our relationships with physicians and other referral sources. The AKS prohibits any person or entity from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering, or paying any remuneration, including a bribe, kickback, or rebate, directly or indirectly, in return for or to induce the referral of patients for items or services covered by federal health care programs, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for products or services covered by such programs (which include plans and programs that provide health benefits funded by the federal government, including Medicare and Medicaid, among others). \u201cRemuneration\u201d has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including, for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash and waivers of payments. Several courts have interpreted the AKS\u2019s\nintent requirement to mean that if even one purpose in an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals or otherwise generate business involving goods or services reimbursed in whole or in part under federal health care programs, the statute has been violated, and in 2020, the Eleventh Circuit ruled that no proof of a payee\u2019s motivation for accepting a payment is required. The federal government has issued \u201csafe harbor\u201d regulations that set forth certain provisions which, if fully met, will assure parties that they will not be sanctioned under the AKS. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit within a specific safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the transaction or arrangement will be illegal or that prosecution under the AKS will be pursued, but such transactions or arrangements face an increased risk of scrutiny by government enforcement authorities and an ongoing risk of prosecution. If our sales and marketing practices or our relationships with physicians are considered by federal or state enforcement authorities to be knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering, or providing any remuneration in exchange for arranging for or recommending our products and services and such activities do not fit within a safe harbor, then these arrangements could be challenged under the AKS.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of the AKS, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties including criminal fines of up to $25,000 per violation, civil monetary penalties of up to $50,000 per violation, assessments of up to three times the amount of the prohibited remuneration, imprisonment and exclusion from participating in the federal health care programs. Violations of the AKS also may result in a finding of civil liability under the Federal False Claims Act (\u201cFFCA\u201d) (as further discussed below) and the potential imposition of additional civil fines and monetary penalties that could be substantial. Falsely certifying compliance with the AKS in connection with a claim submitted to a federally funded insurance program is actionable under the FFCA. In addition, HIPAA and its implementing regulations prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private payors. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment and/or exclusion from government-sponsored programs. The HIPAA false statements statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items, or services.\nA number of states also have anti-fraud and anti-kickback laws similar to the AKS that prohibit certain direct or indirect payments if such arrangements are designed to induce or encourage the referral of patients or the furnishing of goods or services. Some states\u2019 anti-fraud and anti-kickback laws apply only to goods and services covered by Medicaid or programs such as workers\u2019 compensation. Other states\u2019 anti-fraud and anti-kickback laws apply to all health care goods and services, regardless of whether the source of payment is governmental or private. Due to the breadth of these laws and the potential for changes in laws, regulations, or administrative or judicial interpretations, we may have to change our business practices or our existing business practices could be challenged as unlawful, which could materially adversely affect our business.\nCertain federal and state governmental agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, have been investigating issues surrounding pricing information reported by drug manufacturers and used in the calculation of reimbursements as well as sales and marketing practices. For example, many government and third-party payors, historically including Medicare and Medicaid, reimburse doctors and others for the purchase of certain pharmaceutical products based on the product\u2019s average wholesale price (\u201cAWP\u201d) reported by pharmaceutical companies, although the Company has not used the term AWP since 2000. Medicare currently uses average sales price (\u201cASP\u201d) and wholesale acquisition cost (\u201cWAC\u201d) when ASP data is unavailable. The federal government, certain state agencies and private payors are investigating and have begun to file court actions related to pharmaceutical companies\u2019 reporting practices with respect to AWP, alleging that the practice of reporting prices for pharmaceutical products has resulted in a false and overstated AWP, which in turn is alleged to have improperly inflated the reimbursement paid by Medicare beneficiaries, insurers, state Medicaid programs, medical plans and others to health care providers who prescribed and administered those products. In addition, some of these same payors are also alleging that companies are not reporting their \u201cbest price\u201d to the states under the Medicaid program.\nFurthermore, under the FDCA, it is illegal for pharmaceutical companies to promote their products for uses that are not approved by the FDA, and companies that market drugs for so-called \u201coff-label\u201d indications may be subject to civil liability under the FFCA (as further discussed below), as well as to criminal penalties. Over the past decade, numerous lawsuits have been filed against pharmaceutical companies challenging their off-label promotional activities, and pharmaceutical companies, in the aggregate, have paid billions of dollars to defend and settle these cases. While the\nCompany is not currently subject to any lawsuits, a challenge of our off-label promotional activities could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe may become subject to federal and state false claims litigation brought by private individuals and the government.\nWe are subject to state and federal laws that govern the submission of claims for reimbursement. The FFCA imposes civil liability on individuals or entities that knowingly submit, or cause to be submitted, false or fraudulent claims for payment to the government. Violations of the FFCA and other similar laws may result in criminal fines, imprisonment and substantial civil penalties for each false claim submitted (including civil penalties presently in excess of $25,067 per claim, plus treble damages, plus liability for attorney\u2019s fees) and exclusion from federally funded health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. The FFCA also allows private individuals to bring a suit on behalf of the government against an individual or entity for violations of the FFCA. These suits, also known as Qui Tam or whistleblower actions, may be brought by, with only a few exceptions, any private citizen who has material information of a false claim that has not yet been previously disclosed. These suits have increased significantly in recent years because the FFCA allows an individual to share in the amounts paid to the federal government in fines or settlement as a result of a successful Qui Tam action, in addition to the recovery of legal fees in bringing such an action. If our past or present operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from federal health care programs and/or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment, or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against them, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business.\nFederal regulation of arrangements between manufacturers of brand and generic products could adversely affect our business.\nAs part of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, companies are now required to file with the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) and the Department of Justice certain types of agreements entered into between brand and generic pharmaceutical companies related to the manufacture, marketing and sale of generic versions of brand drugs. This new requirement could affect the manner in which generic drug manufacturers resolve intellectual property litigation and other disputes with brand pharmaceutical companies and could result generally in an increase in private-party litigation against pharmaceutical companies or additional investigations or proceedings by the FTC or other governmental authorities. The impact of this new requirement and the potential private-party lawsuits associated with arrangements between brand-name and generic drug manufacturers is uncertain and could adversely affect our business.\nInvestigations of the calculation of average wholesale prices may adversely affect our business.\nMany government and third-party payers, including Medicare, Medicaid, HMOs and MCOs, have historically reimbursed doctors, pharmacies and others for the purchase of certain prescription drugs based on a drug\u2019s AWP or WAC. In the past several years, state and federal government agencies have conducted ongoing investigations of manufacturers\u2019 reporting practices with respect to AWP and WAC, in which they have suggested that reporting of inflated AWPs or WACs has led to excessive payments for prescription drugs. For a description of current and federal and state investigations and claims by private parties, see Note 10 \u201cLegal, Regulatory Matters and Contingencies.\u201d Additional actions are possible. These actions, if successful, could adversely affect us and may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe may incur product liability losses or recall expenses relating to the sale of products containing nitrosamines.\nAccording to FDA guidance, nitrosamine impurities, including, among others, N-nitrosodimethylamine (\u201cNDMA\u201d) may increase the risk of cancer if people are exposed to them above acceptable levels and over long periods of time, but a person taking a drug that contains nitrosamines at-or-below the acceptable daily intake limits every day for 70 years is not expected to have an increased risk of cancer. FDA published a guidance entitled \u201cControl of Nitrosamine Impurities in Human Drugs\u201d that recommends steps manufacturers of APIs and drug products should take to detect and prevent unacceptable levels of nitrosamine impurities in pharmaceutical products. Lannett initiated an internal risk assessment and control strategy for nitrosamines prior to issuance of the guidance. In some cases where its marketed products contain nitrosamines above published FDA acceptable levels (such as ranitidine), Lannett may be required to recall affected product, such as Lannett\u2019s ranitidine product, which was subject to an industry wide recall when NDMA was\ndiscovered as a byproduct of the manufacturing process. Subsequent to the recall of its ranitidine product, Lannett was named a defendant in a series of product liability lawsuits. Product liability claims and lawsuits, safety alerts, product recalls or corrective actions, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers. We are unable to predict at this time if any other Lannett products will be adversely impacted by the global pharmaceutical nitrosamine review.\nAs part of our risk management policy, we carry third-party product liability insurance coverage; however, the insurance industry recently adopted an exclusion into its comprehensive general liability policies for nitrosamine impurities. To the extent that any of Lannett\u2019s products are subject to recall as a result of nitrosamine impurities and/or are subject to lawsuit arising out of the presence of nitrosamine impurities in its products, such losses may not be covered by insurance and could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition.\nIncreasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from customers, regulators, investors, and other stakeholders with respect to our ESG practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to new or additional risks.\nCompanies are facing increasing scrutiny from customers, regulators, investors, and other stakeholders related to their ESG practices and disclosure. Investor advocacy groups, investment funds and influential investors are also increasingly focused on these practices, especially as they relate to the environment, climate change, health and safety, supply chain management, diversity, labor conditions and human rights, both in our own operations and in our supply chain. Increased ESG-related compliance costs for the Company as well as among our suppliers, vendors and various other parties within our supply chain could result in material increases to our overall operational costs. Failure to adapt to or comply with regulatory requirements or investor or stakeholder expectations and standards could negatively impact our reputation, ability to do business with certain partners, access to capital, and our stock price.\nGeneral Business Risks\nPublic health threats, including a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease in the United States or elsewhere may adversely affect our business and financial results.\nOur business may be adversely affected by public health threats, including any pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease occurring in the United States or worldwide. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have an impact on the global economy and the way companies operate. The virus may adversely impact our business, operations and financial results.\nAny business shutdowns or other business interruptions affecting our suppliers or interruptions in global shipping affecting our suppliers could result in our inability to continue receiving sufficient amount of finished dosage products, API and other raw materials. Any business shutdowns or other business interruptions affecting our business development and other strategic partners could also cause delays in the regulatory approval process for and launching of some or all of our pipeline drug candidates. We cannot presently predict the duration and severity of any potential business shutdowns or disruptions, but if we or any of the third parties with whom we engage, including the partners and other third parties with whom we conduct business, were to experience shutdowns or other business disruptions, our ability to conduct our business in the manner and on the timelines presently planned could be materially and adversely impacted. Such delays may impact the Company\u2019s timing for filing applications for product approvals with the FDA as well as related timing of FDA approval of such filings.\nThe loss of key personnel could cause our business to suffer.\nThe success of our present and future operations will depend, to a significant extent, upon the experience, abilities and continued services of our key personnel. If we lose the services of our key personnel, or if they are unable to devote sufficient attention to our operations for any other reason, our business may be significantly impaired. If the employment of any of our current key personnel is terminated, we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and replace the employee with the same caliber of key personnel. As such, we have entered into employment agreements with all of our senior executive officers in order to help retain these key individuals.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology and our systems and infrastructure face certain risks, including cybersecurity and data leakage risks.\nSignificant disruptions to our information technology systems or breaches of information security could adversely affect our business. We are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure to operate our business. In the ordinary course of business, we collect, store and transmit large amounts of confidential information\n(including trade secrets or other intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information) and it is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information. We could be susceptible to third-party attacks on our information technology systems, which attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise, including state and quasi-state actors, criminal groups, \u201chackers\u201d and others. Maintaining the security, confidentiality and integrity of this confidential information (including trade secrets or other intellectual property, proprietary, business information and personal information) is important to our competitive business position. The Company maintains cyber security insurance and, as part of the renewal process, the carrier undertakes an assessment of the security system controls. Additionally, information security falls within the scope of the annual audit performed by our independent audit firm. The Audit Committee has oversight responsibilities over cybersecurity and meets at least quarterly with the Company\u2019s IT management and an outside cybersecurity consulting firm, which performs an annual assessment of our cybersecurity controls. The Audit Committee also communicates with the Company\u2019s independent audit firm frequently regarding their annual audit procedures. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that we can prevent service interruptions or security breaches in our systems or the unauthorized or inadvertent wrongful use or disclosure of confidential information that could adversely affect our business operations or result in the loss, misappropriation and/or unauthorized access, use or disclosure of, or the prevention of access to, confidential information. A breach of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, unapproved dissemination, misappropriation or misuse of trade secrets, proprietary information, or other confidential information, whether as a result of theft, hacking, fraud, trickery or other forms of deception, or for any other cause, could enable others to produce competing products, use our proprietary technology or information and/or adversely affect our business position. Further, any such interruption, security breach, or loss, misappropriation and/or unauthorized access, use or disclosure of confidential information could result in financial, legal, business and reputational harm to us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRising insurance costs, as well as the inability to obtain certain insurance coverage for risks faced by us, could negatively impact profitability.\nThe design, development, manufacture and sale of our products involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and the associated adverse publicity. The cost of insurance, including product liability as well as workers compensation and general liability insurance, has risen in recent years and may increase in the future. In response, we may increase deductibles and/or decrease certain coverage to mitigate these costs. These increases and our increased risk due to increased deductibles and reduced coverage, could have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nAdditionally, certain insurance coverage may not be available to us for risks faced by us. Sometimes the coverage we obtain for certain risks may not be adequate to fully reimburse the amount of damage that we could possibly sustain. Should either of these events occur, the lack of insurance to cover our entire cost would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 89369, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "LCI"}
