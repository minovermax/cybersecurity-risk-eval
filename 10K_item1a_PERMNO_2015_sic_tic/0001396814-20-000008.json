Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information in this Annual Report, any of the factors set forth below could significantly and negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. The trading price of our common stock may decline due to these risks. This section contains forward-looking statements. You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements beginning on page 1.\nRisks Related to the Development and Commercialization of our Products and Product Candidates\nOur success depends primarily on our ability to successfully commercialize EXPAREL.\nWe have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in the development and commercialization of our lead product, EXPAREL, which was approved by the FDA on October 28, 2011 and commercially launched in April 2012. During 2019, sales of EXPAREL constituted substantially all of our total revenue, and we expect it will do so for the foreseeable future. Our success depends on our ability to continue to effectively commercialize EXPAREL. Our ability to effectively generate revenues from EXPAREL will depend on our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\ncreate market demand for EXPAREL through our marketing and sales activities and other arrangements established for the promotion of EXPAREL;\n\u2022\ntrain, deploy and support a qualified sales force;\n\u2022\nsecure formulary approvals for EXPAREL at a substantial number of targeted hospitals and ASCs;\n\u2022\nmanufacture EXPAREL in sufficient quantities in compliance with requirements of the FDA and similar foreign regulatory agencies and at acceptable quality and pricing levels in order to meet commercial demand;\n\u2022\nimplement and maintain agreements with wholesalers and distributors on commercially reasonable terms;\n\u2022\nreceive adequate levels of coverage and reimbursement for EXPAREL from commercial health plans and governmental health programs;\n\u2022\nmaintain compliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nobtain regulatory approvals for additional indications for the use of EXPAREL;\n\u2022\nensure that our entire supply chain efficiently and consistently delivers EXPAREL to our customers; and\n\u2022\nmaintain and defend our patent protection and regulatory exclusivity for EXPAREL.\nAny disruption in our ability to generate revenues from the sale of EXPAREL will have a material and adverse impact on our results of operations.\nOur efforts to successfully commercialize EXPAREL are subject to many internal and external challenges and if we cannot overcome these challenges in a timely manner, our future revenues and profits could be materially and adversely impacted.\nEXPAREL has been a commercialized drug since 2012. We continue to expend significant time and resources to train our sales force to be credible and persuasive in convincing physicians, hospitals and ASCs to use EXPAREL. In addition, we also must train our sales force to ensure that a consistent and appropriate message about EXPAREL is delivered to our potential customers. If we are unable to effectively train our sales force and equip them with effective materials, including medical and sales literature to help them inform and educate potential customers about the benefits and risks of EXPAREL and its proper administration, our efforts to successfully commercialize EXPAREL could be put in jeopardy, which could have a material adverse effect on our future revenues and profits.\nIn addition to our extensive internal efforts, the successful commercialization of EXPAREL will require many third parties, over whom we have no control, to choose to utilize EXPAREL. These third parties include physicians and hospital pharmacy and therapeutics committees, which we refer to as P&T committees. Generally, before we can attempt to sell EXPAREL in a hospital, EXPAREL must be approved for addition to that hospital\u2019s list of approved drugs, or formulary list, by the hospital\u2019s P&T committee. A hospital\u2019s P&T committee typically governs all matters pertaining to the use of medications within the institution, including the review of medication formulary data and recommendations for the appropriate use of drugs within the institution to the medical staff. The frequency of P&T committee meetings at hospitals varies considerably, and P&T committees often require additional information to aid in their decision-making process. Therefore, we may experience substantial delays in obtaining formulary approvals. Additionally, hospital pharmacists may be concerned that the cost of\nacquiring EXPAREL for use in their institutions will adversely impact their overall pharmacy budgets, which could cause pharmacists to resist efforts to add EXPAREL to the formulary, or to implement restrictions on the usage of EXPAREL or to encourage use of a lower cost dose than a surgeon or anesthesiologist would otherwise choose in order to control costs. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining the approvals we need from enough P&T committees quickly enough to optimize hospital sales of EXPAREL. Even if we obtain hospital formulary approval for EXPAREL, physicians must still prescribe EXPAREL for its commercialization to be successful.\nIf EXPAREL does not achieve broad market acceptance, the revenues that we generate from its sales will be limited. The degree of market acceptance of EXPAREL also depends on a number of other factors, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in the standard of care for the targeted indications for EXPAREL, which could reduce the marketing impact of any claims that we can make;\n\u2022\nthe relative efficacy, convenience and ease of administration of EXPAREL;\n\u2022\nthe prevalence and severity of adverse events associated with EXPAREL;\n\u2022\ncost of treatment versus economic and clinical benefit, both in absolute terms and in relation to alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nthe availability of adequate coverage or reimbursement by third parties, such as insurance companies and other healthcare payers, and by government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u2022\nthe extent and strength of our marketing and distribution of EXPAREL;\n\u2022\nthe safety, efficacy and other potential advantages over, and availability of, alternative treatments, including, in the case of EXPAREL, a number of products already used to treat pain in the hospital setting; and\n\u2022\ndistribution and use restrictions imposed by the FDA or to which we agree as part of a mandatory risk evaluation and mitigation strategy or voluntary risk management plan.\nOur ability to effectively promote and sell EXPAREL and any product candidates that we may develop, license or acquire in the hospital or ASC marketplace will also depend on pricing and cost effectiveness, including our ability to produce a product at a competitive price and therefore achieve acceptance of the product onto hospital formularies, and our ability to obtain sufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement. We will also need to demonstrate acceptable evidence of safety and efficacy, as well as relative convenience and ease of administration. Market acceptance could be further limited depending on the prevalence and severity of any expected or unexpected adverse side effects associated with our product candidates.\nIn addition, the labeling approved by the FDA does not contain claims that EXPAREL is safer or more effective than competitive products and does not permit us to promote EXPAREL as being superior to competing products. Further, the availability of inexpensive generic forms of postsurgical pain management products may also limit acceptance of EXPAREL among physicians, patients and third-party payers. If EXPAREL does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance among physicians, patients and third-party payers, we may not generate meaningful revenues from EXPAREL, and we may not return to profitability.\nWe face significant competition from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.\nThe pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Our major competitors include organizations such as major multinational pharmaceutical companies, established biotechnology companies and specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies. Many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have, such as larger research and development staff, more extensive marketing, distribution, sales and manufacturing organizations and experience, more extensive clinical trial and regulatory experience, expertise in prosecution of intellectual property rights and access to development resources like personnel and technology. As a result, these companies may obtain regulatory approval more rapidly than we are able to and may be more effective in selling and marketing their products. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing on an exclusive basis technologies, drug products and medical devices that are more effective or less costly than EXPAREL, iovera\u00b0 or any product candidate that we are currently developing or that we may develop, which could render our products obsolete and noncompetitive or significantly harm the commercial opportunity for EXPAREL, iovera\u00b0 or our product candidates.\nAs a result of these factors, our competitors may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that may limit our ability to develop other indications for, or commercialize, EXPAREL, iovera\u00b0 or our product candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs or medical devices that are safer, more effective, useful or less costly than ours and may be more successful than us in manufacturing and marketing their products.\nEXPAREL competes with well-established products with similar indications. Competing products available for postsurgical pain management include opioids such as morphine, fentanyl, meperidine and hydromorphone, each of which is available generically from several manufacturers, and several of which are available as proprietary products using novel delivery systems. Ketorolac, an NSAID is also available generically in the U.S. from several manufacturers, and Caldolor (ibuprofen for injection), an NSAID, has been approved by the FDA for pain management and fever in adults. In addition, EXPAREL competes with non-opioid products such as bupivacaine, marcaine, ropivacaine and other anesthetics/analgesics, all of which are also used in the treatment of postsurgical pain and are available as either oral tablets, injectable dosage forms or administered using novel delivery systems. Additional products may be developed for the treatment of acute pain, including new injectable NSAIDs, novel opioids, new formulations of currently available opioids and NSAIDs, long-acting local anesthetics and new chemical entities as well as alternative delivery forms of various opioids and NSAIDs. EXPAREL also competes with elastomeric bag/catheter devices intended to provide bupivacaine over several days.\nRegulatory approval for any approved product is limited by the FDA to those specific indications and conditions for which clinical safety and efficacy have been demonstrated, and allegations of our failure to comply with such approved indications could limit our sales efforts and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of prescription drugs and medical devices. These regulations include standards and restrictions for direct-to-consumer advertising, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, promotional activities involving the internet and off-label promotion. Any regulatory approval that the FDA grants is limited to those specific diseases and indications for which a product is deemed to be safe and effective by the FDA. For example, the FDA-approved label for EXPAREL does not include an indication in obstetrical paracervical block anesthesia. In addition to the FDA approval required for new formulations, any new indication for an approved product also requires FDA approval. If we are not able to obtain FDA approval for any desired future indications for our products and product candidates, our ability to effectively market and sell our products may be reduced and our business may be adversely affected.\nWhile physicians in the U.S. may choose, and are generally permitted to prescribe drugs or treatments for uses that are not described in the product\u2019s labeling and for uses that differ from those tested in clinical trials and approved by the regulatory authorities, our ability to promote the products is narrowly limited to those indications that are specifically approved by the FDA. These \u201coff-label\u201d uses are common across medical specialties and may constitute an appropriate treatment for some patients in varied circumstances. Regulatory authorities in the U.S. generally do not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. Regulatory authorities do, however, restrict communications by pharmaceutical and medical device companies on the subject of off-label use. Although recent court decisions suggest that certain off-label promotional activities may be protected under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, the scope of any such protection is unclear. If our promotional activities fail to comply with the FDA\u2019s regulations or guidelines, we may be subject to warnings from, or enforcement action by, these authorities. In addition, our failure to follow FDA rules and guidelines relating to promotion and advertising may cause the FDA to issue warning letters or untitled letters, bring an enforcement action against us, suspend or withdraw an approved product from the market, require a recall or institute fines or civil fines, or could result in disgorgement of money, operating restrictions, injunctions or criminal prosecution, any of which could harm our reputation and our business.\nIf we are unable to establish and maintain effective marketing and sales capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell EXPAREL, we may be unable to generate product revenues.\nWe are continuing to build our commercial infrastructure for the marketing, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products. In order to continue commercializing EXPAREL effectively, we must continue to build our marketing, sales and distribution capabilities. The establishment, development and training of our sales force and related compliance plans to market EXPAREL is expensive and time consuming. In the event we are not successful in developing our marketing and sales infrastructure, we may not be able to successfully commercialize EXPAREL, which would limit our ability to generate product revenues.\nIn addition to our internal marketing and sales efforts, we have entered into agreements with third-party distributors to promote and sell EXPAREL in certain territories. For example, in January 2017, we entered into a co-promotion agreement with DePuy Synthes to market and promote the use of EXPAREL for orthopedic procedures in the U.S. market, and in June 2018, we entered into an agreement with Nuance to advance the development and commercialization of EXPAREL in China. There can be no assurance that such distributors and promoters will be successful in marketing and promoting EXPAREL.\nWe may seek additional distribution arrangements in the future, including arrangements with third-party distributors to commercialize and sell EXPAREL in certain foreign countries. The use of distributors involves certain risks, including risks that such distributors will:\n\u2022\nnot effectively distribute or support our products;\n\u2022\nnot provide us with accurate or timely information regarding their inventories, the number of accounts using our products or complaints about our products;\n\u2022\nfail to comply with their obligations to us;\n\u2022\nfail to comply with laws and regulations to which they are subject, whether in the U.S. or in foreign jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nreduce or discontinue their efforts to sell or promote our products; or\n\u2022\ncease operations.\nAny such failure may result in decreased sales, which would have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on third parties to perform many essential services for EXPAREL and iovera\u00b0 and will rely on third parties for any other products that we commercialize. If these third parties fail to perform as expected or to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, our ability to commercialize EXPAREL and iovera\u00b0 will be significantly impacted and we may be subject to regulatory sanctions.\nWe have entered into agreements with third-party service providers to perform a variety of functions related to the sale and distribution of EXPAREL and iovera\u00b0, key aspects of which are out of our direct control. These service providers provide key services related to customer service support, warehousing and inventory program services, distribution services, contract administration and chargeback processing services, accounts receivable management and cash application services, financial management and information technology services. In addition, our inventory is stored at two warehouses maintained by two service providers. We substantially rely on these providers as well as other third-party providers that perform services for us, including entrusting our inventories of products to their care and handling. If these third-party service providers fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, fail to meet expected deadlines or otherwise do not carry out their contractual duties to us, or encounter physical or natural damage at their facilities, our ability to deliver product to meet commercial demand would be significantly impaired. In addition, we may engage third parties to perform various other services for us relating to adverse event reporting, safety database management, fulfillment of requests for medical information regarding our product candidates and related services. If the quality or accuracy of the data maintained by these service providers is insufficient, we could be subject to regulatory sanctions.\nDistribution of our DepoFoam-based products, including EXPAREL, requires cold-chain distribution provided by third parties, whereby the product must be maintained between specified temperatures. If a problem occurs in our cold-chain distribution processes, whether through our failure to maintain our products or product candidates between specified temperatures or because of a failure of one of our distributors or partners to maintain the temperature of the products or product candidates, the product or product candidate could be adulterated and rendered unusable. We have obtained limited inventory and cargo insurance coverage for our products. However, our insurance coverage may not reimburse us or may not be sufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may suffer. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.\nWe may need to increase the size of our organization and effectively manage our sales force, and we may experience difficulties in managing growth.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had 606 employees. We may need to expand our personnel resources in order to manage our operations and sales of EXPAREL and iovera\u00b0. Our management, personnel, systems and facilities currently in place may not be adequate to support this future growth. In addition, we may not be able to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, particularly marketing positions, due to competition for personnel among pharmaceutical and medical device businesses, and the failure to do so could have a significant negative impact on our future product revenues and business results. Our need to effectively manage our operations, growth and various projects requires that we:\n\u2022\ncontinue the hiring and training of an effective commercial organization for the commercialization of EXPAREL and iovera\u00b0, and establish appropriate systems, policies and infrastructure to support that organization;\n\u2022\ncontinue to establish and maintain effective relationships with distributors and commercial partners for the promotion and sale of our products;\n\u2022\nensure that our distributors, partners, suppliers, consultants and other service providers successfully carry out their contractual obligations, provide high quality results and meet expected deadlines;\n\u2022\nmanage our development efforts and clinical trials effectively;\n\u2022\nexpand our manufacturing capabilities and effectively manage our co-production arrangement with Thermo Fisher;\n\u2022\ncontinue to carry out our own contractual obligations to our licensors and other third parties; and\n\u2022\ncontinue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures.\nWe may be unable to successfully implement these tasks on a larger scale and, accordingly, may not achieve our development and commercialization goals. Additionally, these tasks may impose a strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure. If we are unable to effectively manage our growth, our product sales and resulting revenues will be negatively impacted.\nWe may not be able to manage our business effectively if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel.\nWe may not be able to attract or retain qualified management and commercial, scientific and clinical personnel due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among biotechnology, pharmaceutical, medical device and other businesses, as well as universities, non-profit research organizations and government entities, particularly in San Diego, California, the San Francisco Bay Area and northern New Jersey. If we are not able to attract and retain necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we may experience constraints that will significantly impede the achievement of our development objectives, our ability to raise additional capital and our ability to implement our business strategy.\nOur industry has experienced a high rate of turnover of management personnel in recent years. We are highly dependent on the development and manufacturing expertise for our DepoFoam delivery technology and the commercialization expertise of certain members of our senior management. In particular, we are highly dependent on the skills and leadership of our senior management team. If we lose one or more of these key employees, our ability to successfully implement our business strategy could be seriously harmed. Replacing key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to develop, gain regulatory approval of and commercialize products successfully. Competition to hire from this limited pool is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, retain or motivate additional key personnel.\nWe face potential product liability exposure, and if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability for EXPAREL, iovera\u00b0, DepoCyt(e) or product candidates that we may develop and may have to limit their commercialization.\nThe use of EXPAREL, iovera\u00b0, DepoCyt(e) and any product candidates that we may develop, license or acquire in clinical trials and the sale of any products for which we obtain regulatory approval expose us to the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers, health care providers or others using, administering or selling our products. We have been a party of these suits in the past and may be again in the future. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against these claims, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\nloss of revenue from decreased demand for our products and/or product candidates;\n\u2022\nimpairment of our business reputation or financial stability;\n\u2022\ncosts of related litigation;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management attention;\n\u2022\nloss of revenues;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants and potential termination of clinical trial sites or entire clinical programs; and\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize our products and/or product candidates.\nWe have obtained limited product liability insurance coverage for our products and our clinical trials with a $10.0 million annual aggregate coverage limit. However, our insurance coverage may not reimburse us, or may not be sufficient to reimburse us, for any expenses or losses we may suffer, including our indemnification obligations to other parties. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive, and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage on acceptable terms, at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability. We intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of additional commercial products upon FDA approval for our product candidates in development, but we may be unable to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any products approved for marketing, or at all. On occasion, large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs or medical devices that had unanticipated side effects. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to fall and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and adversely affect our business.\nIf we fail to manufacture our products in sufficient quantities and at acceptable quality and pricing levels, or to fully comply with cGMP regulations, we may face delays in the commercialization of these products or be unable to meet market demand, and may lose potential revenues.\nThe manufacture of EXPAREL requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques, process controls and the use of specialized processing equipment. We must comply with federal, state and foreign regulations, including the FDA\u2019s regulations governing cGMP, enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program and by similar regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions where we do business. These requirements include, among other things, quality control, quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation. The FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities at any time may implement new standards or change their interpretation and enforcement of existing standards for manufacture, packaging or testing of our products. Any failure by us or our manufacturing partner to comply with applicable regulations may result in fines and civil penalties, suspension of production, product seizure or recall, operating restrictions, imposition of a consent decree, modification or withdrawal of product approval or criminal prosecution and would limit the availability of our product. Any manufacturing defect or error discovered after products have been produced and distributed also could result in significant consequences, including costly recall procedures, re-stocking costs, damage to our reputation and potential for product liability claims.\nThe FDA requires manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including the FDA\u2019s QSRs, which requires periodic audits, design controls, quality control testing and documentation procedures, as well as complaint evaluations and investigations. Regulations regarding the development, manufacture and sale of medical products are evolving and are subject to change in the future.\nIf we are unable to produce the required commercial quantities of our products to meet market demand those products on a timely basis or at all, or if we fail to comply with applicable laws for the manufacturing of our products, we will suffer damage to our reputation and commercial prospects, we will lose potential revenues and we may be required to expend significant resources to resolve any such issues.\nWe will need to expand our manufacturing operations or outsource such operations to third parties.\nTo successfully meet future customer demand for EXPAREL and iovera\u00b0, we will need to expand our existing commercial manufacturing facilities or establish large-scale commercial manufacturing capabilities. In addition, as our drug development pipeline increases and matures, we will have a greater need for clinical trial and commercial manufacturing capacity. As a result, we must continue to improve our manufacturing processes to allow us to reduce our production costs. We may not be able to manufacture our drugs and/or medical devices at a cost or in quantities necessary to be commercially successful.\nThe build-up or other expansion of our internal manufacturing capabilities for EXPAREL production in San Diego, California and co-production capabilities at Thermo Fisher\u2019s Swindon, England site, exposes us to significant up-front fixed costs. If market demand for EXPAREL does not align with our expanded manufacturing capacity, we may be unable to offset these costs and to achieve economies of scale, and our operating results may be adversely affected as a result of high operating expenses. Alternatively, if we experience demand for EXPAREL in excess of our estimates, our facilities may be insufficient to support higher production volumes, which could harm our customer relationships and overall reputation. Our ability to meet such excess demand could also depend on our ability to raise additional capital and effectively scale our manufacturing operations.\nIn addition, the procurement time for the equipment that we use to manufacture EXPAREL requires long lead times. Therefore, we may experience delays, additional or unexpected costs and other adverse events in connection with our capacity expansion projects, including those associated with potential delays in the procurement of manufacturing equipment required to manufacture EXPAREL.\nIn addition to expanding our internal manufacturing facilities, we may enter into arrangements with third parties to supply, manufacture, package, test and/or store EXPAREL, iovera\u00b0 or our other products, such as our manufacturing arrangement with Thermo Fisher. Entering into such arrangements requires testing and compliance inspections, FDA approvals and development of the processes and facilities necessary for the production of our products. Such arrangements also involve additional risks, many of which would be outside of our control. Such risks include disruptions or delays in production, manufactured products that do not meet our required specifications, the failure of such third-party manufacturers to comply with cGMP regulations or other regulatory requirements, protection of our intellectual property and manufacturing process, loss of control of our complex manufacturing process, inabilities to fulfill our commercial needs and financial risks in connection with our investment in setting up a third-party manufacturing process, such as the substantial capital outlays that were required by us to assist in setting up our manufacturing process at Thermo Fisher\u2019s facility.\nIf we are unable to timely achieve and maintain satisfactory production yields and quality, whether through our internal manufacturing capabilities or arrangements with contract manufacturers, our relationships with potential customers and overall reputation may be harmed and our revenues could decrease.\nOur inability to continue manufacturing adequate supplies of the product could result in a disruption in the supply to our customers and partners, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nEXPAREL is currently manufactured at our facilities in San Diego, California and at the Thermo Fisher facility in Swindon, England, and iovera\u00b0 is currently manufactured at our facility in Fremont, California. These facilities are the only currently-FDA approved sites for manufacturing EXPAREL and iovera\u00b0 in the world. We may experience temporary or prolonged suspensions in production of our products due to issues in our manufacturing process that must be remediated or in response to inspections conducted by the FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. For example, in June 2017, we discontinued production of DepoCyt(e) due to persistent technical issues specific to the DepoCyt(e) manufacturing process.\nOur San Diego and Fremont facilities in California and the Thermo Fisher facility in Swindon, England are also subject to the risks of a natural or man-made disaster, including earthquakes, floods and fires, or other business disruptions. In addition, we have obtained limited property and business interruption insurance coverage for our manufacturing sites in San Diego, Fremont and England. However, our insurance coverage may not reimburse us, or may not be sufficient to reimburse us, for any expenses or losses we may suffer. There can be no assurance that we would be able to meet our requirements for EXPAREL or iovera\u00b0 if there were a catastrophic event or failure of our current manufacturing systems. If we are required to change or add a new manufacturer or supplier, the process would likely require prior FDA and/or equivalent foreign regulatory authority approval and would be very time consuming. An inability to continue manufacturing adequate supplies of EXPAREL at our facilities in San Diego, California or at the Thermo Fisher facility in Swindon, England or iovera\u00b0 at our facility in Fremont, California could result in a disruption in the supply of EXPAREL or iovera\u00b0 to our customers and partners and a breach of our contractual obligations to such counterparties.\nOur co-production and other agreements with Thermo Fisher may involve unanticipated expenses and delays, including the need for the Thermo Fisher facilities to receive regulatory approvals required for manufacturing to commence at the Thermo Fisher suites.\nWe and Thermo Fisher have entered into a Co-Production Agreement, Technical Transfer and Service Agreement and Manufacturing and Supply Agreement. Under these agreements, Thermo Fisher undertook certain technical transfer activities and construction services to prepare Thermo Fisher\u2019s Swindon, England facility for the manufacture of EXPAREL in two dedicated manufacturing suites, of which one suite received FDA approval in May 2018 and began commercial production in February 2019. We agreed with Thermo Fisher, among other things, to provide them with the process equipment necessary to manufacture EXPAREL in these suites. We have anticipated and budgeted for capital expenditures associated with the two Thermo Fisher suites, including the equipment purchase and construction of the suites as well as payments to be made to Thermo Fisher.\nThe Thermo Fisher facilities require FDA approval prior to any production and manufacturing of EXPAREL. If the construction of the second Thermo Fisher suite is delayed, if Thermo Fisher experiences unanticipated cost overruns, or if the additional Thermo Fisher suite does not receive or maintain regulatory approvals in the timeframe anticipated (if at all), this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nFurther, the production under these agreements involve additional risks, many of which would be outside of our control, such as disruptions or delays in production, manufactured products that do not meet our required specifications, the failure of Thermo Fisher to comply with cGMP regulations or other regulatory requirements, protection of our intellectual property and manufacturing process, loss of control of our complex manufacturing process and inabilities to fulfill our commercial needs.\nWe rely on third parties for the timely supply of specified raw materials and equipment for the manufacture of EXPAREL and iovera\u00b0. Although we actively manage these third-party relationships to provide continuity and quality, some events which are beyond our control could result in the complete or partial failure of these goods and services. Any such failure could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations.\nWe purchase certain raw materials and equipment from various suppliers in order to manufacture our products. The acquisition of certain of these materials may require considerable lead times, and our ability to source such materials is also dependent on logistics providers. If we are unable to source the required raw materials and equipment from our suppliers on a timely basis and in accordance with our specifications, we may experience delays in manufacturing and may not be able to meet our customers\u2019 or partners\u2019 demands for our products. In addition, we and our third-party suppliers must comply with federal, state and foreign regulations, including cGMP regulations, and any failure to comply with applicable regulations, or failure of government agencies to provide necessary authorizations, may harm our ability to manufacture and commercialize our products on a timely and competitive basis, which could result in decreased product sales and lower revenues.\nOur future growth depends on our ability to identify, develop, acquire or in-license products and if we do not successfully identify, develop, acquire or in-license related product candidates or integrate them into our operations, we may have limited growth opportunities.\nAn important part of our business strategy is to continue to develop a pipeline of product candidates by developing, acquiring or in-licensing products, businesses or technologies that we believe are a strategic fit with our focus on the hospital marketplace. However, these business activities may entail numerous operational and financial risks, including:\n\u2022\nsignificant capital expenditures;\n\u2022\ndifficulty or inability to secure financing to fund development activities for such development, acquisition or in-licensed products or technologies;\n\u2022\nincurrence of substantial debt or dilutive issuances of securities to pay for development, acquisition or in-licensing of new products;\n\u2022\nthe successful integration of acquired products, businesses or technologies into our operations, and achieving the expected benefits and synergies from such acquisitions;\n\u2022\ndisruption of our business and diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention;\n\u2022\nhigher than expected development, acquisition or in-license and integration costs;\n\u2022\nexposure to unknown liabilities;\n\u2022\ndifficulty and cost in combining the operations and personnel of any acquired businesses with our operations and personnel;\n\u2022\ninability to retain key employees of any acquired businesses;\n\u2022\ndifficulty entering markets in which we have limited or no direct experience;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in managing multiple product development programs; and\n\u2022\ninability to successfully develop new products or clinical failure.\nWe have limited resources to identify and execute the development, acquisition or in-licensing of products, businesses and technologies and integrate them into our current infrastructure. We may compete with larger pharmaceutical and medical device companies and other competitors, including public and private research organizations, academic institutions and government agencies, in our efforts to establish new collaborations and in-licensing opportunities. These competitors may have access to greater financial resources, research and development staffs and facilities than us and may have greater expertise in identifying and evaluating new opportunities. We may not be successful in locating and acquiring or in-licensing additional desirable product candidates on acceptable terms or at all. We may also not be successful in developing or commercializing our current product candidates. Such efforts may require the dedication of significant financial and personnel resources, and any diversion of resources may also disrupt our management from expanding on EXPAREL or iovera\u00b0 sales. Moreover, we may devote resources to potential development, acquisitions or in-licensing opportunities that are never completed, or we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such efforts.\nOur business involves the use of hazardous materials and we must comply with environmental laws and regulations, which can be expensive and restrict how we do business.\nOur manufacturing activities involve the controlled storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials, including the components of our products, product candidates and other hazardous compounds. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling, release and disposal of, and exposure to, these hazardous materials. Violation of these laws and regulations could lead to substantial fines and penalties. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials or unintended failure to comply with these laws and regulations. In the event of an accident or failure to comply with these laws and regulations, state or federal authorities may curtail our use of these materials and interrupt our business operations. In addition, we could become subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of any contamination, whether currently unknown or caused by future releases.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, human error, unauthorized access, natural disasters, intentional acts of vandalism, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. Any system failure, accident or security breach that causes interruptions in our operations could result in a material disruption of our product development programs. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed clinical trials for EXPAREL could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we may incur liability, reputation damage and harm to our business operations.\nAny collaboration arrangements that we may enter into in the future may not be successful, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates.\nOur business model is to commercialize our products in the U.S. and abroad, occasionally seeking collaboration arrangements with pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies for the development or commercialization of our products in other countries. Accordingly, we may enter into collaboration arrangements in the future on a selective basis. Any future collaboration arrangements that we enter into may not be successful. The success of our collaboration arrangements will depend heavily on the efforts and activities of our collaborators. Collaborators generally have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaboration arrangements.\nDisagreements between parties to a collaboration arrangement regarding clinical development and commercialization matters can lead to delays in the development process or commercializing the applicable product candidate and, in some cases, termination of the collaboration arrangement. These disagreements can be difficult to resolve if neither of the parties has final decision-making authority.\nCollaborations with pharmaceutical and/or medical device companies and other third parties often are terminated or allowed to expire by the other party. Any such termination or expiration would adversely affect us financially and could harm our business reputation.\nClinical trials may fail to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our drug products or medical devices, which could prevent or significantly delay obtaining regulatory approval.\nPrior to receiving approval to commercialize any of our drug products or medical devices, we must demonstrate with scientifically appropriate and statistically sound evidence from well-controlled clinical trials, and to the satisfaction of the FDA, other regulatory authorities in the U.S., and other countries, that each of the products is both safe and effective. For each drug product, we will need to demonstrate its efficacy and monitor its safety throughout the process. If such development is unsuccessful, our business and reputation would be harmed and our stock price would be adversely affected.\nAll of our drug and medical device products are prone to the risks of failure inherent in development. Clinical trials of new drug and medical device products sufficient to obtain regulatory marketing approval are expensive and take years to complete. We may not be able to successfully complete clinical testing within the time frame we have planned, or at all. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, the clinical trial process which could delay or prevent us from receiving regulatory approval or commercializing our products. In addition, the results of pre-clinical studies and early-stage clinical trials of our products do not necessarily predict the results of later-stage clinical trials. Later-stage clinical trials may fail to demonstrate that a product is safe and effective despite having progressed through initial clinical testing. Even if we believe the data collected from clinical trials of our products is promising, such data may not be sufficient to support approval by the FDA or any other U.S. or foreign regulatory approval authority. Pre-clinical and clinical data can be interpreted in different ways.\nAccordingly, the FDA or other regulatory authorities could interpret such data in different ways than we or our partners do, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA, other regulatory authorities, our institutional review boards, our contract research organizations or we ourselves may suspend or terminate our clinical trials for our drug products and medical devices. Any failure or significant delay in completing clinical trials for our drug products or medical devices, or in receiving regulatory approval for the sale of any drugs or medical devices resulting from our products, may severely harm our business and reputation. Even if we receive FDA and other regulatory approvals, our drug and medical device products may later exhibit adverse effects that may limit or prevent their widespread use, may cause the FDA to revoke, suspend or limit their approval, or may force us to withdraw products derived from those drug or medical device products from the market.\nOur dependence on contract research organizations could result in delays in and additional costs for our drug development efforts.\nWe may rely on contract research organizations, or CROs, to perform preclinical testing and clinical trials for drug candidates that we choose to develop without a collaborator. If the CROs that we hire to perform our preclinical testing and clinical trials or our collaborators or licensees do not meet deadlines, do not follow proper procedures or a conflict arises between us and our CROs, our preclinical testing and clinical trials may take longer than expected, may be delayed or may be terminated. If we were forced to find a replacement CRO to perform any of our preclinical testing or clinical trials, we may not be able to find a suitable replacement on favorable terms, if at all. Even if we were able to find another CRO to perform a preclinical test or clinical trial, any material delay in a test or clinical trial may result in significant additional expenditures that could adversely affect our operating results. Events such as these may also delay regulatory approval for our drug candidates or our ability to commercialize our products.\nWe depend on clinical investigators and clinical sites to enroll patients in our clinical trials and sometimes other third parties to manage the trials and to perform related data collection and analysis, and, as a result, we may face costs and delays outside of our control.\nWe rely on clinical investigators and clinical sites to enroll patients and sometimes third parties to manage our trials and to perform related data collection and analysis. However, we may be unable to control the amount and timing of resources that the clinical sites which conduct the clinical testing may devote to our clinical trials.\nOur clinical trials may be delayed or terminated due to the inability of our clinical investigators to enroll enough patients. Patient enrollment depends on many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the trial protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites and the eligibility criteria for the trial. If our clinical investigators and clinical sites fail to enroll a sufficient number of patients in our clinical trials or fail to enroll them on our planned schedule, we may face increased costs, delays or termination of the trials, which could delay or prevent us from obtaining regulatory approvals for our product candidates.\nOur agreements with clinical investigators and clinical sites for clinical testing and for trial management services place substantial responsibilities on these parties, which could result in delays in, or termination of, our clinical trials if these parties fail to perform as expected. For example, if any of our clinical trial sites fail to comply with FDA-approved GCPs, we may be unable to use the data gathered at those sites. If these clinical investigators, clinical sites or other third parties do not carry out their contractual duties or obligations or fail to meet expected deadlines, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to their failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize, our product candidates.\nWe are subject to periodic litigation, which could result in losses or unexpected expense of time and resources.\nFrom time to time, we are called upon to defend ourselves against lawsuits relating to our business. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. See Item 3 Legal Proceedings in Part I of this Annual Report. An unfavorable outcome in these or other proceedings could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any significant litigation in the future, regardless of its merits, could divert management\u2019s attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees. In addition, if our stock price is volatile, we may become involved in additional securities class action lawsuits in the future. Any litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business.\nRegulatory Risks\nWe have reached an agreement in principle regarding our inquiry by the United States Department of Justice for roughly $3.5 million. If the agreement is not finalized, an ongoing investigation could result in significant liability and have a material adverse effect on our sales, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn April 2015, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of New Jersey, requiring the production of a broad range of documents pertaining to marketing and promotional practices related to EXPAREL. We are cooperating with the government\u2019s inquiry. We can make no assurances as to the time or resources that will need to be devoted to this inquiry or its final outcome, or the impact, if any, of this inquiry or any proceedings on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn December 2019, we reached an agreement in principle with the Department of Justice and more than one state Attorney General\u2019s office (the \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) on a proposal for a global civil settlement in the amount of $3.5 million, subject to accrual of interest on the settlement amount from the date of the agreement in principle, negotiation of a definitive settlement agreement and other contingencies. As part of the settlement, Pacira will admit no wrongdoing and will explicitly deny the Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations. Pacira has been given assurances that, if the parties can agree to negotiation of the settlement, this will conclude the investigation that originated from the U.S. Department of Justice subpoena in April 2015.\nIf a final settlement cannot be reached, and as a result of this inquiry that started with the April 2015 subpoena, proceedings are initiated and we are found to have violated one or more applicable laws, we may be subject to significant liability, including without limitation, civil fines, criminal fines and penalties, civil damages and exclusion from federal funded healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, as well as potential liability under the federal False Claims Act and state false claims acts, and/or be required to enter into a corporate integrity or other settlement with the government, any of which could materially affect our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Conduct giving rise to such liability could also form the basis for private civil litigation by third-party payors or other persons allegedly harmed by such conduct. In addition, if some of our existing business practices are challenged as unlawful, we may have to change those practices, including changes and impacts on the practices of our sales force, which could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business could be materially adversely affected if the FDA determines that we are promoting or have in the past promoted the \u201cOff-label\u201d use of our products.\nThe FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of prescription drugs and medical devices. These regulations include standards and restrictions for direct-to-consumer advertising, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, promotional activities involving the internet and off-label promotion. According to these regulations, companies may not promote drugs or medical devices for \u201cOff-label\u201d uses-that is, uses that are not consistent with the product\u2019s labeling and that differ from those that were approved by the FDA. For example, the FDA-approved label for EXPAREL does not include an indication in obstetrical paracervical block anesthesia. In addition to the FDA approval required for new formulations or device enhancements, any new indication for an approved product also requires FDA approval. If we are not able to obtain FDA approval for any desired future indications for our products and product candidates, our ability to effectively market and sell our products may be reduced and our business may be adversely affected.\nWhile physicians in the U.S. may choose, and are generally permitted to prescribe drugs and/or medical devices for uses that are not described in the product\u2019s labeling and for uses that differ from those tested in clinical trials and approved by the regulatory authorities, under the FDA\u2019s regulations our ability to promote the products is narrowly limited to those indications that are approved by the FDA. \u201cOff-label\u201d uses are common across medical specialties and may constitute an appropriate treatment for some patients in varied circumstances. Regulatory authorities in the U.S. generally do not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. Regulatory authorities do, however, restrict communications by pharmaceutical and medical device companies on the subject of off-label use. Although recent court decisions suggest that certain off-label promotional activities may be protected under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, the scope of such protection is unclear. Moreover, while we promote our products consistent with what we believe to be the approved indication for our drugs and medical devices, the FDA may disagree. If the FDA determines that our promotional activities fail to comply with the FDA\u2019s regulations or guidelines, we may be subject to warnings from, or enforcement action by, these authorities. In addition, our failure to follow FDA rules and guidelines relating to promotion and advertising may cause the FDA to issue warning letters or untitled letters, bring an enforcement action against us, suspend or withdraw an approved product from the market, require a recall or institute fines or civil fines, or could result in disgorgement of money, operating restrictions, injunctions or criminal prosecution, any of which could harm our reputation and our business.\nIn September 2014, we received a warning letter from the OPDP pertaining to certain promotional aspects of EXPAREL. We took actions to immediately address the FDA\u2019s concerns and minimize further disruption to our business. Ultimately, however, in September 2015, we, along with two independent physicians, filed a lawsuit in federal court against the FDA and other governmental defendants seeking to exercise our lawful rights to communicate truthful and non-misleading information about EXPAREL. The complaint outlined our belief that the FDA\u2019s warning letter received in September 2014 and regulations restricting our truthful and non-misleading speech about EXPAREL violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the First and Fifth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution. The lawsuit sought a declaration and injunctive relief to permit us to promote EXPAREL consistent with its approved indication and pivotal trials that supported FDA approval. On December 15, 2015, we announced that the FDA had formally withdrawn the September 2014 Warning Letter via a \u201cRescission Letter,\u201d and that the FDA and Pacira had reached an amicable resolution of the lawsuit. As part of the resolution of this matter, the FDA confirmed that EXPAREL was broadly approved for \u201cadministration into the surgical site to produce postsurgical analgesia\u201d in a variety of surgeries not limited to those studied in its pivotal trials. The FDA also approved a labeling supplement for EXPAREL that further clarified that EXPAREL was not limited to any specific surgery type or site, that the proper dosage and administration of EXPAREL is based on various patient and procedure-specific factors, that there was a significant treatment effect for EXPAREL compared to placebo over the first 72 hours in the pivotal hemorrhoidectomy trial and that EXPAREL may be admixed with bupivacaine, provided certain medication ratios are observed. The Warning Letter and labeling supplement only applied to the infiltration indication that was approved at that time, and does not apply to the interscalene brachial plexus nerve block indication approved in April 2018. We and the FDA agreed that, in future interactions, the parties will deal with each other in an open, forthright and fair manner.\nWe are unable to predict whether any future regulatory actions will have an effect on our product sales, and even if such actions are ultimately resolved favorably, our sales may suffer due to reputational or other concerns. We can make no assurances that we will not receive FDA warning letters in the future or be subject to other regulatory action. As noted above, any regulatory violation or allegations of a violation may have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business.\nWe may not receive regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, or the approval may be delayed for various reasons, including successful challenges to the FDA\u2019s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2), which would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe may experience delays in our efforts to obtain regulatory approval from the FDA for any of our product candidates, and there can be no assurance that such approval will not be delayed, or that the FDA will ultimately approve these product candidates. Although the FDA\u2019s longstanding position has been that the Agency may rely upon prior findings of safety or effectiveness to support approval of a 505(b)(2) application, this policy has been controversial and subject to challenge in the past. If the FDA\u2019s policy is successfully challenged administratively or in court, we may be required to seek approval of our products via full NDAs that contain a complete data package demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of our product candidates, which would be time-consuming, expensive and would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nThe FDA, as a condition of the EXPAREL NDA approval on October 28, 2011, has required us to study EXPAREL in pediatric patients as a post-marketing requirement. We have agreed to a trial timeline where we will study successive pediatric patient subpopulations. In December 2019, we announced positive results for our extended pharmacokinetic and safety study for local analgesia in children aged 6 to 17 undergoing cardiovascular or spine surgeries. Those positive results will provide the foundation for an sNDA. We are also working with the FDA to define a program to study the administration of EXPAREL as a nerve block in the pediatric setting. These trials will be expensive and time consuming and we are required to meet the timelines for submission of protocols and data and for completion as agreed with the FDA, and we may be delayed in meeting such timelines. We are required to conduct these trials even if we believe that the costs and potential benefits of conducting the trials are not warranted from a scientific or financial perspective. The failure to conduct these pediatric trials or to meet applicable deadlines could result in the imposition of sanctions, including, among other things, issuance of warnings letters or imposition of seizures or injunctions.\nFor iovera\u00b0 and any other potential medical device, we must obtain clearance or approval from the FDA or other regulatory authorities prior to introducing a new product or a modification to an existing product. The regulatory clearance process may result in substantial delays, unexpected or additional costs and other unforeseen factors and limitations on the types and uses of products we would be able to commercialize, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nIn the U.S., before we are able to market a new medical device, or a new use, claim for or significant modification to an existing medical device, we generally must first receive clearance or approval from the FDA and certain other regulatory authorities. Many foreign jurisdictions outside the U.S. also require clearance, approval or compliance with certain standards before a medical device or other product can be marketed. The process of obtaining regulatory clearances and approvals to market a medical device can be costly, time consuming, involve rigorous pre-clinical and clinical testing, require changes in products or result in limitations on the indicated uses of products. There can be no assurance that these clearances and\napprovals will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, once a medical device has been cleared or approved, a new clearance or approval may be required before the medical device may be modified, its labeling changed or marketed for a different use. Medical devices are cleared or approved for one or more specific intended uses and promoting a device for an off-label use could result in government enforcement action. Furthermore, a product approval or clearance can be withdrawn or limited due to unforeseen problems with the medical device or issues relating to its application. The regulatory clearance and approval process may result in, among other things, delayed, if at all, realization of product net sales, substantial additional costs and limitations on the types of products we may bring to market or their indicated uses, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe FDA may determine that our products or any of our product candidates have undesirable side effects.\nIf concerns are raised regarding the safety of a new product candidate as a result of undesirable side effects identified during clinical testing, the FDA may decline to approve the drug or medical device or issue a letter requesting additional data or information prior to making a final decision regarding whether or not to approve the product. The number of such requests for additional data or information issued by the FDA in recent years has increased, and resulted in substantial delays in the approval of several new drugs and medical devices. Undesirable side effects caused by our products or any product candidate could also result in the inclusion of unfavorable information in our product labeling, imposition of distribution or use restrictions, a requirement to conduct post-market studies or to implement a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, denial, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications, and in turn prevent us from commercializing and generating revenues from the sale of EXPAREL, iovera\u00b0 or any product candidate.\nFor example, the side effects observed in the EXPAREL clinical trials completed to date include nausea and vomiting. In addition, the class of drugs that EXPAREL belongs to has been associated with nervous system and cardiovascular toxicities at high doses. We cannot be certain that these side effects and others will not be observed in the future, or that the FDA will not require additional trials or impose more severe labeling restrictions due to these side effects or other concerns. The active component of EXPAREL is bupivacaine and bupivacaine infusions have been associated with the destruction of articular cartilage, or chondrolysis. Chondrolysis has not been observed in clinical trials of EXPAREL, but we cannot be certain that this side effect will not be observed in the future.\nFollowing approval of EXPAREL, iovera\u00b0 or any of our product candidates, if we or others later identify previously unknown undesirable side effects caused by such products, if known side effects are more frequent or severe than in the past, or if we or others detect unexpected safety signals for such products or any products perceived to be similar to such products:\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require the addition of unfavorable labeling statements, specific warnings or contraindications (including boxed warnings);\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may suspend or withdraw their approval of the product, or require it to be removed from the market;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may impose restrictions on the distribution or use of the product;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to change the way the product is administered, conduct additional clinical trials, reformulate the product, change the labeling of the product or change or obtain re-approvals of manufacturing facilities;\n\u2022\nsales of the product may be significantly decreased from projected sales;\n\u2022\nwe may be subject to government investigations, product liability claims and litigation; and\n\u2022\nour reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of our products or any of our product candidates and could substantially increase our commercialization costs and expenses, which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating significant revenues from its sale.\nRegulatory approval for any approved product is limited by the FDA to those specific indications and conditions for which clinical safety and efficacy have been demonstrated.\nAny regulatory approval is limited to those specific diseases and indications for which a product is deemed to be safe and effective by the FDA. For example, the FDA-approved label for EXPAREL does not include an indication in obstetrical paracervical block anesthesia. In addition to the FDA approval required for new products or product enhancements, any new indication for an approved product also requires FDA approval. If we are not able to obtain FDA approval for any desired\nfuture indications for our products and product candidates, our ability to effectively market and sell our products may be reduced and our business may be adversely affected.\nWhile physicians may choose to prescribe drugs and medical devices for uses that are not described in the product\u2019s labeling and for uses that differ from those tested in clinical trials and approved by the regulatory authorities, our ability to promote the products is limited to those indications that are specifically approved by the FDA.\nIf we do not comply with federal, state and foreign laws and regulations relating to the health care business, we could face substantial penalties.\nWe and our customers are subject to extensive regulation by the federal government, and the governments of the states and foreign countries in which we may conduct our business. In the U.S., the laws that directly or indirectly affect our ability to operate our business include the following:\n\u2022\nthe Federal Anti-Kickback Law, which prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce either the referral of an individual or furnishing or arranging for a good or service for which payment may be made under federal health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u2022\nother Medicare laws and regulations that prescribe the requirements for coverage and payment for services performed by our customers, including the amount of such payment;\n\u2022\nthe Federal False Claims Act, which imposes civil and criminal liability on individuals and entities who submit, or cause to be submitted, false or fraudulent claims for payment to the government;\n\u2022\nthe Federal False Statements Act, which prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services; and\n\u2022\nvarious state laws that impose similar requirements and liability with respect to state healthcare reimbursement and other programs.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws and regulations described above or any other law or governmental regulation to which we or our customers are or will be subject, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Similarly, if our customers are found to be non-compliant with applicable laws, they may be subject to sanctions, which could also have a negative impact on us. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations would adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business and damage our reputation.\nThe design, development, manufacture, supply and distribution of EXPAREL are highly regulated and technically complex.\nThe design, development, manufacture, supply and distribution of EXPAREL are all highly regulated. We, along with our third-party providers, must comply with all applicable regulatory requirements of the FDA and foreign authorities. In addition, the facilities used to manufacture, store and distribute EXPAREL are subject to inspection by regulatory authorities at any time to determine compliance with applicable regulations.\nThe manufacturing techniques and facilities used for the manufacture and supply of our products must be operated in conformity with cGMP and other FDA and MHRA regulations, including potentially prior regulatory approval. In addition, any expansion of our existing manufacturing facilities or the introduction of any new manufacturing facilities, including the manufacturing suites at Thermo Fisher\u2019s facility, also require conformity with cGMP and other FDA and MHRA regulations. In complying with these requirements, we, along with our co-production partners and suppliers, must continually expend time, money and effort in production, record keeping and quality assurance and control to ensure that our products meet applicable specifications and other requirements for safety, efficacy and quality. In addition, we, along with our co-production partners and suppliers, are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA, MHRA and other regulatory authorities.\nAny failure to comply with regulatory and other legal requirements applicable to the manufacture, supply and distribution of our products could lead to remedial action (such as recalls), civil and criminal penalties and delays in manufacture, supply and distribution of our products.\nThe design, development, manufacture, supply and distribution of EXPAREL are all highly complex. If we are unable to manufacture EXPAREL in compliance with our highly complex specifications in the future, we may be subject to product exchanges, significant costs and charges, supply constraints or other corrective measures.\nIf we fail to comply with the extensive regulatory requirements to which we and our products are subject, such products could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market and we could be subject to penalties.\nThe testing, manufacturing, quality control, labeling, safety, effectiveness, advertising, promotion, storage, sales, distribution, import, export and marketing, among other things, of EXPAREL, iovera\u00b0 and our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere throughout the world. Quality control and manufacturing procedures regarding EXPAREL and our product candidates must conform to cGMP. Regulatory authorities, including the FDA and the MHRA, periodically inspect manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP. Our failure, or the failure of any contract manufacturers with whom we may work in the future, to comply with the laws administered by the FDA, the MHRA or other governmental authorities could result in, among other things, any of the following:\n\u2022\nproduct recall or seizure;\n\u2022\nsuspension or withdrawal of an approved product from the market;\n\u2022\ninterruption of production;\n\u2022\nreputational concerns of our customers or the medical community;\n\u2022\noperating restrictions;\n\u2022\nwarning letters;\n\u2022\ninjunctions;\n\u2022\nrefusal to permit import or export of an approved product;\n\u2022\nrefusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n\u2022\ndenial of permission to file an application or supplement in a jurisdiction;\n\u2022\nconsent decrees;\n\u2022\nsuspension or termination of ongoing clinical trials;\n\u2022\nfines and other monetary penalties;\n\u2022\ncriminal prosecutions; and\n\u2022\nunanticipated expenditures.\nIf the government or third-party payers fail to provide adequate coverage and payment rates for EXPAREL, iovera\u00b0 or any future products, or if hospitals or ASCs choose to use therapies that are less expensive, our revenue and prospects for profitability will be limited.\nIn both domestic and foreign markets, sales of our existing products and any future products will depend in part upon the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers. Such third-party payers include government health programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Coverage decisions may depend upon clinical and economic standards that disfavor new drug products when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are already available or subsequently become available. Assuming coverage is approved, the resulting reimbursement payment rates might not be adequate. In particular, many U.S. hospitals and ASCs receive a fixed reimbursement amount per procedure for certain surgeries and other treatment therapies they perform. Because this amount may not be based on the actual expenses the hospital or ASC incurs, these sites may choose to use therapies which are less expensive when compared to our product candidates. Although hospitals and ASCs may receive separate reimbursement for EXPAREL, iovera\u00b0 or any product candidates that we may develop, in-license or acquire, if approved, will face competition from other therapies and drugs for these limited hospital and ASC financial resources. We may need to conduct post-marketing studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of any future products to the satisfaction of hospitals, ASCs, other target\ncustomers and their third-party payers. Such studies might require us to commit a significant amount of management time, financial and other resources. Our future products might not ultimately be considered cost-effective. Adequate third-party coverage and reimbursement might not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development.\nThird-party payers, whether foreign or domestic, or governmental or commercial, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. For example, third-party payers may limit the indications for which our products will be reimbursed to a smaller set of indications than we believe is appropriate or limit the circumstances under which our products will be reimbursed to a smaller set of circumstances than we believe is appropriate. In addition, in the U.S., no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug or medical device products exists among third-party payers. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payer to payer.\nFurther, we believe that future coverage and reimbursement will likely be subject to increased restrictions both in the U.S. and in international markets, as federal, state and foreign governments continue to propose and pass new legislation designed to reduce or contain the cost of healthcare. Third-party coverage and reimbursement for our products or product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval may not be available or adequate in either the U.S. or international markets, which could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nPublic concern regarding the safety of drug products such as EXPAREL and medical device products such as iovera\u00b0 could result in the inclusion of unfavorable information in our labeling, or require us to undertake other activities that may entail additional costs.\nIn light of widely publicized events concerning the safety risk of certain drug products, the FDA, members of Congress, the Government Accountability Office, medical professionals and the general public have raised concerns about potential drug and medical device safety issues. These events have resulted in the withdrawal of drug and medical device products, revisions to labeling that further limits use of the drug and medical device products and the establishment of risk management programs that may, for example, restrict distribution of drug or medical device products after approval. The Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, or FDAAA, grants significant expanded authority to the FDA, much of which is aimed at improving the safety of drug and medical device products before and after approval. In particular, the FDAAA authorizes the FDA to, among other things, require post-approval studies and clinical trials, mandate changes to product labeling to reflect new safety information and require risk evaluation and mitigation strategies for certain drugs and medical devices, including certain currently approved drugs and medical devices. The FDAAA also significantly expands the federal government\u2019s clinical trial registry and results databank, which we expect will result in significantly increased government oversight of clinical trials. Under the FDAAA, companies that violate these and other provisions of the new law are subject to substantial civil monetary penalties, among other regulatory, civil and criminal penalties. The increased attention to drug safety issues may result in a more cautious approach by the FDA in its review of data from our clinical trials. Data from clinical trials may receive greater scrutiny, particularly with respect to safety, which may make the FDA or other regulatory authorities more likely to require additional preclinical studies or clinical trials. If the FDA requires us to provide additional clinical or preclinical data for EXPAREL or iovera\u00b0, the indications for which these products were approved may be limited or there may be specific warnings or limitations on dosing, and our efforts to commercialize EXPAREL or iovera\u00b0 may be otherwise adversely impacted.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nThe patents and the patent applications that we have covering our products are limited to specific injectable formulations, processes and uses of drugs encapsulated in our DepoFoam drug delivery technology and our market opportunity for our product candidates may be limited by the lack of patent protection for the active ingredient itself and other formulations and delivery technology and systems that may be developed by competitors.\nThe active ingredient in EXPAREL is bupivacaine. Patent protection for the bupivacaine molecules themselves has expired and generic immediate-release products are available. As a result, competitors who obtain the requisite regulatory approval can offer products with the same active ingredient as EXPAREL so long as the competitors do not infringe any process, use or formulation patents that we have developed for drugs encapsulated in our DepoFoam drug delivery technology.\nFor example, we are aware of at least one long-acting injectable bupivacaine product in development which utilizes an alternative delivery system to EXPAREL. Such a product is similar to EXPAREL in that it also extends the duration of effect of bupivacaine, but achieves this clinical outcome using a completely different drug delivery system as compared to our DepoFoam drug delivery technology.\nThe number of patents and patent applications covering products in the same field as EXPAREL indicates that competitors have sought to develop and may seek to market competing formulations that may not be covered by our patents and patent applications. The commercial opportunity for EXPAREL could be significantly harmed if competitors are able to develop and commercialize alternative formulations of bupivacaine that are long-acting but outside the scope of our patents.\nBecause EXPAREL has been approved by the FDA, one or more third parties may challenge the patents covering this product, which could result in the invalidation or unenforceability of some or all of the relevant patent claims. For example, if a third-party files an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, for a generic drug product containing bupivacaine and relies in whole or in part on studies conducted by or for us, the third-party will be required to certify to the FDA that either: (i) there is no patent information listed in the FDA\u2019s Orange Book with respect to our NDA for EXPAREL; (ii) the patents listed in the Orange Book have expired; (iii) the listed patents have not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patents are invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of the third-party\u2019s generic drug product. A certification that the new product will not infringe the Orange Book-listed patents for EXPAREL, or that such patents are invalid, is called a paragraph IV certification. If the third-party submits a paragraph IV certification to the FDA, a notice of the paragraph IV certification must also be sent to us once the third-party\u2019s ANDA is accepted for filing by the FDA. We may then initiate a lawsuit to defend the patents identified in the notice. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of receipt of the notice automatically prevents the FDA from approving the third-party\u2019s ANDA until the earliest of 30 months or the date on which the patent expires, the lawsuit is settled or the court reaches a decision in the infringement lawsuit in favor of the third-party. If we do not file a patent infringement lawsuit within the required 45-day period, the third-party\u2019s ANDA will not be subject to the 30-month stay. Litigation or other proceedings to enforce or defend intellectual property rights are often very complex in nature, may be very expensive and time-consuming, may divert our management\u2019s attention from our core business and may result in unfavorable results that could adversely impact our ability to prevent third parties from competing with our products.\nThe patents and the patent applications that we have covering our iovera\u00b0 products are primarily limited to specific handheld cryogenic needle devices that are cooled by a cryogen and methods for applying cryotherapy to nerve tissue using the cryogenic devices. Our market opportunity for our product candidates may be limited by gaps in patent coverage for the cryogenic devices, methods of use and other cryotherapy technology and systems that may be developed by competitors.\nThe iovera\u00b0 cryogenic device is a compact, self-contained handheld device with a replaceable cryogen cartridge that delivers a cryogen through internal supply tubes to needle lumens of a replaceable needle probe, so as to cool the needle probe and thereby cool a surrounding target nerve tissue. We also have secured patents covering particular cryotherapy methods and pain treatments that provide what we deem to be optimal treatment using the iovera\u00b0 cryogenic device.\nAlthough we have patents that are broad enough to cover various alternative designs and methods, much of our patent coverage is tailored to cover the iovera\u00b0 device and methods of use. It is thus possible that competitors may attempt to design around many of our patents. For example, we are aware of competitors developing cryogenic systems that are not self-contained handheld devices, or cryogenic systems that deliver cryotherapy through different mechanisms. It is also possible that competitors may attempt to develop and market cryotherapy devices and methods not covered by our patents, for example, basic cryotherapy treatment systems that are off-patent or cryoanalgesia for other nerve entrapment treatments.\nThe commercial opportunity for iovera\u00b0 could be significantly harmed if competitors are able to develop and commercialize alternative designs and methods outside the scope of our patents.\nFurthermore, our earliest patent family is scheduled to expire in 2025, thereby opening the door for competitors to copy some of our early technology. This early patent family is primarily focused on treating cosmetic defects that are no longer the focus of iovera\u00b0, but the underlying technology is nonetheless relevant enough for there to be appreciable overlap.\nFinally, one or more third parties may challenge the patents covering the iovera\u00b0 product, which could result in the invalidation or unenforceability of some or all of the relevant patent claims. Litigation or other proceedings to defend or enforce intellectual property rights are often very complex in nature, may be very expensive and time-consuming, may divert our management\u2019s attention from our core business and may result in unfavorable results that could adversely impact our ability to prevent third parties from competing with our products.\nBecause it is difficult and costly to protect our proprietary rights, we may not be able to ensure their protection and all patents will eventually expire.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and trade secret protection for EXPAREL, iovera\u00b0, DepoFoam and for any product candidates that we may develop, license or acquire and the methods we use to manufacture them, as well as successfully defending these patents and trade secrets against third-party challenges. We will only be able to protect our technologies from unauthorized use by third parties to the extent that valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets cover them.\nThe patent positions of pharmaceutical, medical device and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in pharmaceutical, medical device or biotechnology patents has emerged to date in the U.S. Patent positions and policies outside the U.S. are even more uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent\nlaws in the U.S. and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents or in third-party patents.\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage. For example:\n\u2022\nwe may not have been the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications and issued patents;\n\u2022\nwe may not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u2022\nothers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our product candidates or technologies;\n\u2022\nit is possible that none of the pending patent applications will result in issued patents;\n\u2022\nthe issued patents covering our product candidates may not provide a basis for commercially viable active products, may not provide us with any competitive advantages, may not have sufficient scope or strength to protect the technologies they were intended to protect or may be challenged by third parties;\n\u2022\nothers may design around our patent claims to produce competitive products that fall outside the scope of our patents;\n\u2022\nwe may not develop or in-license additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;\n\u2022\npatents of others may have an adverse effect on our business; or\n\u2022\ncompetitors may infringe our patents and we may not have adequate resources to enforce our patents.\nPatent applications in the U.S. are maintained in confidence for at least 18 months after their earliest effective filing date. Consequently, we cannot be certain we were the first to invent or the first to file patent applications on EXPAREL, iovera\u00b0, our DepoFoam drug delivery technology or any product candidates that we may develop, license or acquire. In the event that a third-party has also filed a U.S. patent application relating to our product candidates or a similar invention, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the USPTO to determine priority of invention in the U.S. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial and it is possible that our efforts would be unsuccessful, resulting in a material adverse effect on our U.S. patent position. Furthermore, we may not have identified all U.S. and foreign patents or published applications that affect our business either by blocking our ability to commercialize our drugs or medical devices or by covering similar technologies that affect our drug or medical device markets.\nIn addition, some countries, including many in Europe, do not grant patent claims directed to methods of treating humans, and in these countries patent protection may not be available at all to protect our product candidates. Even if patents are issued, we cannot guarantee that the claims of those patents will be valid and enforceable or provide us with any significant protection against competitive products, or otherwise be commercially valuable to us. Furthermore, while we generally apply for patents in those countries where we intend to make, have made, use or sell patented products, we may not accurately predict all of the countries where patent protection will ultimately be desirable. If we fail to timely file a patent application in any such country, we may be precluded from doing so at a later date. We also cannot assure you that the patents issuing as a result of our foreign patent applications will have the same scope of coverage as our U.S. patents.\nSome of our older patents have already expired. In the case of EXPAREL, the European and U.S. patents protecting the formulation of EXPAREL expired in 2018. An existing formulation patent for EXPAREL expired in November 2013. An existing formulation patent for EXPAREL expired in the U.S. in 2013 and its equivalents in Canada, Germany, France, Spain, Italy and the United Kingdom expired in 2014. Our earliest patent family for iovera\u00b0 is scheduled to expire in 2025. Once our patents covering EXPAREL and iovera\u00b0 have expired, we will be more reliant on trade secrets to protect against generic competition.\nWe also rely on trade secrets to protect our technology, particularly where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. While we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets through confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements, our licensors, employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information to competitors. Policing unauthorized use of our trade secrets or enforcing a claim that a third-party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, trade secret laws in other countries may not be as\nprotective as they are in the U.S. Thus, courts outside the U.S. are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how.\nIn order to protect the goodwill associated with our company and product names, we rely on trademark protection for our marks. We have registered the \u201cPacira\u201d, \u201cEXPAREL\u201d, \u201ciovera\u00b0\u201d, \u201cDepoCyt\u201d, and \u201cDepoCyte\u201d marks with the USPTO. A third-party may assert a claim that one of our marks is confusingly similar to its mark, and such claims or the failure to timely register a mark or objections by the FDA could force us to select a new name for one of our product candidates, which could cause us to incur additional expense or delay the commercialization of such product.\nIf we fail to obtain or maintain patent protection or trade secret protection for EXPAREL, iovera\u00b0, DepoFoam or any product candidate that we may develop, license or acquire, third parties could use our proprietary information, which could impair our ability to compete in the market and adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and achieve profitability.\nIf we are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, it will be costly and time consuming, and an unfavorable outcome in any litigation would harm our business.\nOur ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell EXPAREL, iovera\u00b0, our DepoFoam drug delivery technology or any product candidates that we may develop, license or acquire depends upon our ability to avoid infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the general fields of pain management and cancer treatment and cover the use of numerous compounds, formulations and medical devices in our targeted markets. Because of the uncertainty inherent in any patent or other litigation involving proprietary rights, we and our licensors may not be successful in defending intellectual property claims by third parties, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Regardless of the outcome of any litigation, defending the litigation may be expensive, time-consuming and distracting to management. In addition, because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us, which may later result in issued patents that EXPAREL or iovera\u00b0 may infringe. There could also be existing patents of which we are not aware that EXPAREL or iovera\u00b0 may inadvertently infringe.\nThere is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries in general. If a third-party claims that we infringe on their products or technology, we could face a number of issues, including:\n\u2022\ninfringement and other intellectual property claims which, with or without merit, can be expensive and time consuming to litigate and can divert management\u2019s attention from our core business;\n\u2022\nsubstantial damages for past infringement which we may have to pay if a court decides that our product infringes on a competitor\u2019s patent;\n\u2022\na court prohibiting us from selling or licensing our product unless the patent holder licenses the patent to us, which it would not be required to do;\n\u2022\nif a license is available from a patent holder, we may have to pay substantial royalties or grant cross licenses to our patents; and\n\u2022\nredesigning our processes so they do not infringe, which may not be possible or could require substantial funds and time.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nAs is common in the biotechnology, pharmaceutical and medical device industries, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology, pharmaceutical and medical device companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although no claims against us are currently pending, we may be subject to claims that these employees or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nRisks Related to Cybersecurity\nIf we do not maintain the privacy and security of personal and business information, we could damage our reputation with customers and employees, incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation.\nWe receive, retain and transmit personal information about our customers and employees and entrust that information to third-party suppliers, including cloud service-providers that perform activities for us. Our business depends upon the secure transmission of encrypted confidential information over public networks, including information permitting payments. A compromise of our security systems or defects within our hardware or software, or those of our suppliers, that results in our customers\u2019 or employees\u2019 information being obtained by unauthorized persons, could adversely affect our reputation with our customers and others, as well as our operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could result in litigation, government actions, or the imposition of penalties. In addition, a breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to the security of information systems and could disrupt our operations.\nThe use of data by our business is regulated at the national and state or local level in all of our operating countries. Privacy and information-security laws and regulations change, and compliance with them may result in cost increases due to, among other things, systems changes and the development of new processes. If we or those with whom we share information fail to comply with these laws and regulations, our reputation could be damaged, possibly resulting in lost future business, and we could be subjected to additional legal risk as a result of non-compliance.\nWe have security measures and controls to protect personal and business information and continue to make investments to secure access to our information technology network. These measures may be undermined, however, due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, internal or external malfeasance, or otherwise, and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate business and personal information. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, timely discover or counter them, or implement adequate preventative measures. Any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and potentially have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nChanges in data privacy and protection laws and regulations, particularly in Europe, or any failure to comply with such laws and regulations, could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations globally regarding privacy, data protection and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer and security of personal data. Significant uncertainty exists as privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements. These laws apply to transfers of information among our affiliates, as well as to transactions we enter into with third-party vendors. For example, the E.U. adopted a comprehensive General Data Privacy Regulation, or GDPR, in May 2016 that replaced the then-current E.U. Data Protection Directive and related country-specific legislation in May 2018. GDPR requires companies to satisfy new requirements regarding the handling of personal and sensitive data, including its use, protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves. Failure to comply with GDPR requirements could result in penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue. Complying with the enhanced obligations imposed by the GDPR may result in significant costs to our business and require us to revise certain of our business practices. In addition, legislators and regulators in the U.S. are proposing new and more robust cybersecurity rules in light of the recent broad-based cyberattacks at a number of companies. These and similar initiatives around the world could increase the cost of developing, implementing or securing our servers and require us to allocate more resources to improved technologies, adding to our information technology and compliance costs. In addition, enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase. The enactment of more restrictive laws, rules, regulations, or future enforcement actions or investigations could impact us through increased costs or restrictions on our business, and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability.\nRisks Related to our Financial Condition and Capital Requirements\nCumulatively, we have incurred significant losses since our inception and may incur additional losses in the future.\nTo date, we have focused primarily on developing and commercializing EXPAREL. We incurred net losses of $11.0 million, $0.5 million and $42.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $399.4 million. Our losses, among other things, have had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital. We incurred significant pre-commercialization expenses as we prepared for the commercial launch of EXPAREL, and we incur significant sales, marketing and manufacturing expenses, as well as continued development expenses related to the commercialization of EXPAREL and\niovera\u00b0. As a result, we had not been profitable prior to 2015 and have not been since. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical products and medical devices, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses.\nWe may not return to profitability.\nOur ability to return to profitability depends upon our ability to generate revenue from EXPAREL and iovera\u00b0. Our ability to generate revenue depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to:\n\u2022\nmanufacture commercial quantities of EXPAREL and iovera\u00b0 at acceptable cost levels; and\n\u2022\ncontinue to develop a commercial organization and the supporting infrastructure required to successfully market and sell both EXPAREL and iovera\u00b0.\nWe anticipate incurring significant additional costs associated with the commercialization of both EXPAREL and iovera\u00b0 and are unsure as to whether we will be able to return to profitability. If we are unable to generate additional revenues, we will not be able to do so and may be unable to continue operations without continued funding.\nWe may need additional funding and may be unable to raise capital when needed, which would force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.\nDeveloping and commercializing products for use in the hospital or ASC settings, conducting clinical trials, establishing outsourced manufacturing relationships and successfully manufacturing and marketing drugs and medical devices that we may develop is expensive. We may need to raise additional capital to:\n\u2022\ncontinue to fund our operations;\n\u2022\ncontinue our efforts to hire additional personnel and build a commercial infrastructure to commercialize EXPAREL and iovera\u00b0;\n\u2022\nqualify, outsource or build additional commercial-scale manufacturing of our products under cGMP;\n\u2022\nin-license and develop additional product candidates; and\n\u2022\nrefinance our 2.375% convertible senior notes, due April 2022.\nWe may not have sufficient financial resources to continue our operations or meet all of our objectives, which could require us to postpone, scale back or eliminate some, or all, of these objectives. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe costs of maintaining a commercial organization to sell, market and distribute EXPAREL and iovera\u00b0;\n\u2022\nthe success of the commercialization of EXPAREL and iovera\u00b0;\n\u2022\nthe cost and timing of manufacturing sufficient supplies of EXPAREL and iovera\u00b0 to meet customer demand, including the cost of expanding our manufacturing facilities to produce EXPAREL and iovera\u00b0;\n\u2022\nthe rate of progress and costs of our efforts to prepare for the submission of an NDA, sNDA or 510(k) pre-market notification for any product candidates that we may in-license or acquire in the future, and the potential that we may need to conduct additional clinical trials to support applications for regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nthe costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights associated with our product candidates, including any such costs we may be required to expend if our licensors are unwilling or unable to do so;\n\u2022\nthe effect of competing technological and market developments;\n\u2022\nthe terms and timing of any collaborative, licensing, co-promotion or other arrangements that we may establish; and\n\u2022\nthe potential that we may be required to file a lawsuit to defend our patent rights or regulatory exclusivities from challenges by companies seeking to market generic versions of extended-release liposome injection of bupivacaine or a cryoanalgesic device that infringes on the various patents covering iovera\u00b0.\nFuture capital requirements will also depend on the extent to which we acquire or invest in additional complementary businesses, products and technologies.\nUntil we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue, if ever, we expect to finance or supplement future cash needs through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, royalties, collaboration and licensing arrangements, as well as through interest income earned on cash and investment balances. We cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of our development programs or our commercialization efforts.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly.\nWe expect our operating results to be subject to quarterly fluctuations. Our operating results will be affected by numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe level of underlying hospital and ASC demand for EXPAREL and iovera\u00b0 and end-user buying patterns;\n\u2022\nmaintaining our existing manufacturing facilities for EXPAREL and iovera\u00b0, expanding our manufacturing capacity and constructing a second suite for the manufacture of EXPAREL with our co-production partner, Thermo Fisher, including installing specialized processing equipment for the manufacturing of EXPAREL;\n\u2022\nour execution of other collaborative, licensing, distribution, manufacturing or similar arrangements and the timing of payments we may make or receive under these arrangements;\n\u2022\nvariations in the level of expenses related to our future development programs;\n\u2022\nany product liability or intellectual property infringement lawsuit in which we may become involved; and\n\u2022\nregulatory developments, lawsuits and investigations affecting EXPAREL, iovera\u00b0 or the product candidates of our competitors;\nIf our quarterly or annual operating results fall below the expectations of our investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Furthermore, any quarterly or annual fluctuations in our operating results may, in turn, cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially. We believe that quarterly comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.\nWe may be unable to successfully integrate the businesses and personnel of acquired companies and businesses, and may not realize the anticipated synergies and benefits of such acquisitions.\nFrom time to time, we may complete acquisitions of companies and certain businesses of companies, and we may not realize the expected benefits from such acquisitions because of integration difficulties or other challenges. For example, on April 9, 2019, we completed the MyoScience Acquisition.\nThe success of any acquisitions will depend, in part, on our ability to realize all or some of the anticipated synergies and other benefits from integrating the acquired businesses with our existing businesses. The integration process may be complex, costly and time-consuming. The potential difficulties we may face in integrating the operations of our acquisitions include, among others:\n\u2022\nfailure to implement our business plans for the combined businesses and consolidation or expansion of production capacity as planned and where applicable;\n\u2022\nunexpected losses of key employees, customers or suppliers of our acquired companies and businesses;\n\u2022\nunanticipated issues in conforming our acquired companies\u2019 and businesses\u2019 standards, processes, procedures and controls with our operations;\n\u2022\ncoordinating new product and process development;\n\u2022\nincreasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\nadverse effects on our or our acquired companies\u2019 and businesses\u2019 existing business relationships;\n\u2022\nunanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations;\n\u2022\noperating risks inherent in our acquired companies\u2019 and businesses\u2019 business and operations;\n\u2022\nunanticipated expenses and liabilities;\n\u2022\npotential unfamiliarity with our acquired companies and businesses technology, products and markets, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage; and\n\u2022\nother difficulties in the assimilation of our acquired companies and businesses operations, technologies, products and systems.\nIf MyoScience or any other acquired companies and businesses may have unanticipated or larger than anticipated liabilities for patent and trademark infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, taxes and other known and unknown types of liabilities, there may be liabilities that we underestimated or did not discover in the course of performing our due diligence investigation of our acquired companies and businesses. We may have no recourse or limited recourse under the applicable acquisition-related agreement to recover damages relating to the liabilities of our acquired companies and businesses.\nWe may not be able to maintain or increase the levels of revenue, earnings or operating efficiency that each of the acquired companies and businesses and us had historically achieved or might achieve separately. In addition, we may not accomplish the integration of any acquired companies and businesses smoothly, successfully or within the anticipated costs or timeframe. If we experience difficulties with the integration process or if the business of any acquired companies or businesses deteriorates, the anticipated cost savings, growth opportunities and other synergies of any acquired companies and businesses may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. If any of the above risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely impacted, we may fail to meet the expectations of investors or analysts, and our stock price may decline as a result.\nRaising additional funds by issuing securities may cause dilution to existing stockholders and raising funds through lending and licensing arrangements may restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our existing stockholders\u2019 ownership would be diluted. If we raise additional funds through licensing arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish potentially valuable rights to our potential products or proprietary technologies, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. Any debt financing we enter into may involve covenants that restrict our operations. These restrictive covenants may include limitations on additional borrowing and specific restrictions on the use of our assets as well as prohibitions on our ability to create liens, pay dividends, redeem our stock or make investments.\nThe use of our net operating loss carryforwards and research tax credits will be limited.\nWe have significant federal and state net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards and federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards. Our NOL carryforwards and research and development tax credits may expire and not be used. Our NOL carryforwards will begin expiring in 2026 for federal purposes and in 2024 for state purposes if we have not used them prior to that time. For any federal NOLs generated after December 31, 2017, the NOLs will have an indefinite life and utilization will be subject to a limitation of 80% of taxable income. The non-U.S. NOLs do not expire. Additionally, our ability to use certain NOLs and credit carryforwards to offset taxable income or tax, respectively, in the future will be limited under Internal Revenue Code Sections 382 and 383 because we experienced cumulative changes in ownership of more than 50% within a three-year period. Such ownership changes were triggered by the cumulative ownership changes arising as a result of the initial acquisition of the Company\u2019s stock in 2007 and the completion of our initial public offering and our other financing transactions. Because of the ownership changes, we will be limited regarding the amount of NOL carryforwards and research tax credits that we can utilize annually in the future to offset taxable income or tax, respectively. Such an annual limitation will significantly reduce the utilization of the NOLs and research tax credits before they expire. In addition, California and certain states have suspended use of NOL carryforwards for certain taxable years, and other states are considering similar measures. As a result, we may incur higher state income tax expense in the future. Depending on our future tax position, continued suspension of our ability to use NOL carryforwards in states in which we are subject to income tax could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness and our Common Stock\nOur common stock price may be subject to significant fluctuations and volatility.\nOur stock price is volatile, and from February 3, 2011, the first day of trading of our common stock, to February 19, 2020, the trading prices of our stock have ranged from $6.16 to $121.95 per share.\nOur stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe commercial success of EXPAREL and iovera\u00b0;\n\u2022\nresults of clinical trials of our products, product candidates or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges or developments in laws or regulations applicable to our products or product candidates;\n\u2022\nintroduction of competitive products or technologies;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet or exceed financial projections we provide to the public;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet or exceed the estimates and projections of the investment community;\n\u2022\nthe perception of the pharmaceutical and medical device industry by the public, legislatures, regulators and the investment community;\n\u2022\nregulatory concerns or government actions\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and market conditions and overall fluctuations in U.S. equity markets;\n\u2022\ndevelopments concerning our sources of manufacturing supply;\n\u2022\ndisputes or other developments relating to patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key scientific or management personnel;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which we acquire or invest in products, businesses and technologies;\n\u2022\nissuances of debt, equity or convertible securities;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market valuations of similar companies; and\n\u2022\nthe other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the market for small pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. Fluctuations in our stock price could, among other things, adversely impact the trading price of our shares.\nServicing our indebtedness requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial indebtedness.\nOur ability to make payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, including the 2.375% convertible senior notes due 2022, or 2022 Notes, issued in our private offering completed on March 13, 2017, as described below, or to make cash payments in connection with any conversion of the 2022 Notes depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our indebtedness and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring indebtedness or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nOn March 13, 2017, we completed a private placement of $345.0 million in aggregate principal amount of\nour 2022 Notes, and entered into an indenture agreement, or 2022 Indenture, with respect to the 2022 Notes. The 2022 Notes accrue interest at a fixed rate of 2.375% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The 2022 Notes mature on April 1, 2022. As of December 31, 2019, our total consolidated gross indebtedness was $345.0 million, all of which was the principal outstanding on the 2022 Notes and all of which was unsecured indebtedness. Additionally, our subsidiaries had no indebtedness (excluding trade payables, intercompany liabilities and income tax-related liabilities).\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the 2022 Notes in cash to the extent elected or to repurchase the 2022 Notes upon a fundamental change, and our future indebtedness may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion of the 2022 Notes or limitations on our ability to repurchase the 2022 Notes.\nHolders of the 2022 Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their 2022 Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a repurchase price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, upon conversion of the 2022 Notes (if we choose to settle the principal amount in cash at our option), we will be required to make cash payments for each $1,000 in principal amount of 2022 Notes converted of at least the lesser of $1,000 and the sum of the daily conversion values. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of 2022 Notes surrendered therefor or 2022 Notes being converted. Any credit facility or other agreement that we may enter into may limit our ability to make cash payments at the time of a fundamental change or upon conversion of the 2022 Notes. Further, our ability to repurchase the 2022 Notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the 2022 Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase 2022 Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the 2022 Notes as required by the 2022 Indenture would constitute a default under the 2022 Indenture. A default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the 2022 Notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.\nFuture sales in the public market or issuances of our common stock could lower the market price for our common stock.\nIn the future, we may sell additional shares of our common stock to raise capital. Except under limited circumstances, we are not restricted from issuing additional common stock, including securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock. The issuance of additional shares of our common stock or convertible securities, including upon exercise of our outstanding options, vesting of our restricted stock units or otherwise, will dilute the ownership interest of our common stockholders. In addition, our greater than 5% stockholders may sell a substantial number of their shares in the public market, which could also affect the market price for our common stock. We cannot predict the size of future sales or issuances of our common stock or the effect, if any, that they may have on the market price for our common stock. The issuance and/or sale of substantial amounts of common stock, or the perception that such issuances and/or sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity or debt securities.\nSome provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and our bylaws, as well as provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL, could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nauthorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\neliminating the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders; and\n\u2022\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the DGCL, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless such transactions are approved by our board of directors. This provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to finance the further development and expansion of our business and do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to declare or pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, restrictions contained in future financing instruments, provisions of applicable law and any other factors our board of directors deems relevant.", "PERMNO": 12583, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "PCRX"}
