{"cik": "1437578", "company": "BRIGHT HORIZONS FAMILY SOLUTIONS INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report should be carefully considered. Set forth below are certain risks related to our business, industry and common stock that could have an adverse effect on our operations. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties, not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial, may also impair our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted our business and our financial condition and operating results and will continue to adversely impact our business.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has substantially disrupted our global operations. We expect to continue to be impacted as the situation remains dynamic and subject to rapid and potentially material changes. As of December 31, 2020, we operated 1,014 child care and early education centers with the capacity to serve approximately 114,000 children and their families, of which 910 child care centers with the capacity to serve approximately 105,000 children were open. While we are focused on the re-enrollment and ramping of our centers and continuing the phased re-opening of our centers that remain temporarily closed, the continued or additional disruptions to our business and potential adverse impacts to our financial condition and results of operations resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022significant changes in the conditions of the markets we operate in, including required school and business closures, stay-at-home mandates or new lockdown orders, limiting our ability to provide our services, especially center-based child care and center-based back-up child care, and potentially resulting in continued center closures or permanent center closures;\n\u2022reduced enrollment upon the re-opening of centers and difficulty re-ramping enrollment as families may limit their participation in various public activities and gatherings, including group child care, or as social distancing protocols and other licensing regulations may reduce group sizes or otherwise affect the overall capacity of children we can serve;\n\u2022inability to hire and maintain an adequate level of center staff requiring us to reduce enrollment in order to comply with mandated ratios, inability to retain teachers after long periods of furlough, and the impact to our operations if a significant percentage of our workforce is unable to return to work because of illness, quarantine, worker absenteeism, limitations on travel, or government or social distancing restrictions, or difficulty maintaining or retaining staff, which may have a disproportionate impact on our business compared to other companies that depend less on the in-person provision of services;\n\u2022periodic classroom closures or temporary center closures due to potential exposure to COVID-19, which may impact our reputation or impact parent/client confidence resulting in reduced demand or the adoption of alternative child care options;\n\u2022the length of time before COVID-19 vaccines are available to the general public or children or the lack of widespread adoption and acceptance of the vaccine by the general public, which may have a disproportionate impact on our business compared to other companies that depend less on the in-person provision of services;\n\u2022reduced or shifting demand for our services due to adverse and uncertain economic and demographic conditions, including as a result of clients that have been adversely impacted, and/or increased unemployment, continued school and business closures, new lockdown orders, long-term shift to an at-home workforce, and general effects of a broad-based economic recession;\n\u2022incremental costs associated with mitigating the effects of the pandemic, additional procedures and protocols required to maintain health and safety at our centers, and costs and reputational harm associated with a potential COVID-19 outbreak at our centers, or the failure of compliance with our COVID-19 health and safety protocols;\n\u2022a decrease in revenues due to clients requesting refunds or renegotiating contracts for reduced or changing services;\n\u2022the potential deterioration in the collectability of our existing accounts receivable and a decrease in the generation of new revenue due to the potential diminished financial health of our clients;\n\u2022inability to implement our growth strategies due to prolonged business contraction and reduced capital expenditures and cost-saving initiatives;\n\u2022delayed re-opening or permanent closure of centers outside of our control due in large part to the interdependence of our operations with our client partners\u2019 operating decisions and requirements as well as decisions by governmental authorities regarding school and business closures and requirements for re-opening;\n\u2022legal actions or proceedings related to COVID-19;\n\u2022potential asset impairments or write-downs as we review assets impacted as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022reduction in our liquidity position limiting our ability to service our indebtedness and our future ability to incur additional indebtedness or financing; and\n\u2022downgrades to our credit rating by ratings agencies which could reduce our ability to access capital markets.\nThese factors could place limitations on our ability to operate effectively and could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and operating results. As the situation continues to evolve and more information and guidance becomes available, we may adjust our current plans, policies and procedures to address the rapidly changing variables related to the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic could continue to have a negative impact on our results of operations, the size and duration of which we are currently unable to predict. Additional impacts may arise of which we are currently not aware, the nature and extent of which will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nChanges in the demand for child and adult/elder dependent care, and workplace solutions, which may be negatively affected by demographic trends and economic conditions, may affect our operating results.\nOur business strategy depends on employers recognizing the value in providing employees with child care, dependent care, workforce education, and other workplace solutions as an employee benefit. The number of employers that view such services as cost-effective or beneficial to their workforces may not continue to grow at the levels we anticipate or may diminish. In addition, changes in demographic trends, including the number of two working parent or working single parent families in the workforce, may impact the demand for our services. Such changes could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nEven as employers recognize the value of our services, demand may be adversely affected by general economic conditions or changes in workforce demographics and work-place environments as a result of COVID-19. Uncertainty or a deterioration in economic conditions could lead to reduced demand for our services as employer clients may reduce or eliminate their sponsorship of work and family services, and prospective clients may not commit resources to such services. In addition, a reduction in the size of an employer\u2019s workforce could negatively impact the demand for our services and result in reduced enrollment or failure of our employer clients to renew their contracts. A deterioration of general economic conditions or changes in workforce demographics may adversely impact the need for our services because out-of-work parents may decrease or discontinue the use of child care services, or be unwilling to pay tuition for high-quality services. Additionally, we may not be able to increase the price for our services at a rate consistent with increases in our operating costs. If demand for our services were to decrease, it could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nOur business depends largely on our ability to hire and retain qualified teachers and maintain strong employee relations.\nThe provision of child care services is personnel intensive. Our business depends on our ability to attract, train, and retain the appropriate mix of qualified employees and on effectively implementing and maintaining strong employee relations, cultivating an atmosphere of trust, and effectively communicating the value proposition of working at Bright Horizons. The child care industry traditionally has experienced high turnover rates. In addition, state laws require our teachers and other staff members to meet certain educational and other minimum requirements, and we often require that teachers and staff at our centers have additional qualifications. We are also required by state laws to maintain certain prescribed minimum adult-to-child ratios. If we are unable to hire and retain qualified teachers at a center, we could be required to reduce enrollment or be prevented from accepting additional enrollment in order to comply with such mandated ratios. In certain markets, we may experience difficulty in attracting, hiring and retaining qualified teachers due to tight labor pools, or we may experience difficulty in attracting and retaining teachers due to health concerns and changes in the work environment as a result of COVID-19, which may require us to offer increased salaries, enhanced benefits and institute initiatives to maintain strong employee relations, which could result in increased costs. Difficulties in hiring and retaining qualified personnel may also affect our ability to meet growth objectives in certain geographies and to take advantage of additional enrollment opportunities at our child care and early education centers in these markets, which could negatively impact our business. From time to time we may be subject to employee organizing efforts. Labor union representation of a material number of our employees could impact our business, financial condition or operating results as a result of additional labor costs, payroll and benefit expenses, new rules and practices, or work stoppages.\nBecause our success depends substantially on the value of our brands and reputation as a provider of choice, adverse publicity could impact the demand for our services.\nOur reputation and brand are critical to our business. Adverse publicity concerning reported incidents or allegations of inappropriate, illegal or harmful acts to a child at any child care center or by a caregiver or through a third party provider, whether or not directly relating to or involving Bright Horizons, could result in decreased enrollment at our child care centers, termination of existing corporate relationships, inability to attract new corporate relationships, or increased insurance costs, all of which could adversely affect our operations. Brand value and our reputation can be severely damaged even by isolated incidents, particularly if the incidents receive considerable negative publicity or result in substantial litigation. These incidents may arise from events that are beyond our ability to control, such as instances of abuse or actions taken (or not taken) by one or more center managers, teachers, or caregivers relating to the health, safety or welfare of children in our care. In addition, from time to time, customers and others make claims and take legal action against us. Whether or not claims have merit, they may adversely affect our reputation and the demand for our services. Such demand could also diminish significantly if any such incidents or other matters erode general confidence in us or our services, which would likely result in lower sales, and could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. Any reputational damage could have a material adverse effect on our brand value and our business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nBreaches in data security and other information technology interruptions could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nAs part of our business, we collect and store sensitive data and certain personal information from our clients, the families and children we serve, and our employees. We also utilize third-party vendors and electronic payment methods to process and store some of this information, including credit card information. Storing this data exposes us to increased risk of privacy and/or security breaches as well as increased vulnerability to cyber-attacks. Cybersecurity threats in particular are persistent, evolve quickly, and include, but are not limited to, computer viruses, ransomware attacks, attempts to access information, phishing scams, denial of service attacks and other security breaches of software, systems or platforms. Such cybersecurity threats may increase as a result of COVID-19 and the related shift to more employees working remotely, as cybercriminals attempt denial of service related attacks and other disruptive actions. Like many businesses, we have in the past and will in the future continue to be subject to cybersecurity threats and attempts to compromise and penetrate our data security and systems.\nWe also face the potential for business disruptions from information technology interruptions associated with natural disasters and other events including power outages, catastrophic events, computer and network failures, inadequate or ineffective redundancy, and flaws in third-party software or services. Our back-up care and educational advisory services are highly dependent on information technology for the coordination and delivery of services, which could be significantly impacted by a breach in our security and systems, or other system interruptions. Our policies and practices and operational safeguards, measures and controls aimed at protecting and recovering our data and ensuring business continuity, may not be sufficient to prevent cybersecurity breaches or ensure our key services are delivered without minimal disruption in the event of information technology system failures.\nFailure of these systems to operate effectively or a compromise in the security of our systems that results in unauthorized persons or entities obtaining personal information could materially and adversely affect our reputation, operations, operating results, and financial condition. Breaches in our data security, those of our affiliates or other third-parties, could expose us to risks of data loss, inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, litigation or the imposition of penalties against us, liability, impede our processing of transactions and our financial reporting, and could result in a disruption of our operations. The impact of these security threats and other disruptions are difficult to predict, our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all related costs and we may not otherwise be fully indemnified for them. Additionally, any related negative publicity could significantly harm our reputation and could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nIn addition, as the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous, with new and changing requirements applicable to our business, including the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act, compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs and failure to comply with such regulations could result in significant penalties and damages which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOur continued profitability depends on our ability to pass on our increased costs, such as labor and related costs, to our customers.\nHiring and retaining key employees and qualified personnel, including teachers, is critical to our business and labor costs are our largest expense. Because we are primarily a service business, inflationary factors and regulatory changes that contribute to wage and benefits cost increases result in significant increases in the costs of running our business. We expect to pay employees at rates above the minimum wage, and increases in the statutory minimum wage rates could result in a corresponding increase in the wages and benefits we pay to our employees. Additionally, competition for teachers in certain markets, and costs associated with rehiring and retaining previously furloughed employees, and costs of retraining teachers could result in significant increases in the cost of running our business. Our success depends on our ability to continue to pass along these costs to our customers and to meet our changing labor needs while controlling costs. In the event that we cannot increase the price for our services to cover these higher wage and benefit costs without reducing customer demand for our services, our margins could be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations as well as our growth.\nChanges in our relationships with employer sponsors or failure to anticipate and respond to changing client and customer (parents or client employees) preferences and expectations may affect our operating results.\nWe derive a significant portion of our business from child care and early education centers, back-up care, and other workplace solutions associated with employer sponsors for whom we provide these services at single or multiple sites pursuant to contractual arrangements. Our contracts with employers for full-service center-based child care typically have terms of three to ten years, and our contracts related to back-up care and educational advisory services typically have terms of one to three years, with varying terms and renewal and termination options. We have a history of consistent contract renewals, but we may not experience similar renewal rates in the future. The termination or non-renewal of a significant number of contracts or the termination of a multiple-site or multiple-service client relationship could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Additionally, our continued success depends on our ability to convert and retain new and existing clients and our ability to develop new consumer-oriented strategies or services to accommodate changing client, learner, or parent expectations and preferences around service delivery. Our future success depends on our ability to continue to meet the evolving needs and expectations of our customers, including enhancing our existing services. Failure to meet these needs may result in client loss and reduced demand and could have a material impact on our financial results.\nWe depend on key management and key employees to manage our business.\nOur success depends on the efforts, abilities and continued services of our executive officers and other key employees. We believe future success will depend upon our ability to continue to attract, motivate and retain highly-skilled managerial, sales and marketing, divisional, regional and child care and early education center director personnel as well as key personnel in the back-up care and educational advisory markets. Failure to retain our leadership team and attract and retain other important personnel could lead to disruptions in management and operations, which could affect our business and operating results.\nOur operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations.\nOur revenue and results of operations fluctuate with the seasonal demands for child care and the other services we provide. Revenue in our child care centers typically declines during the third quarter due to decreased enrollments over the summer months as families withdraw children for vacations and older children transition into elementary schools. In addition, use of our back-up services tends to be higher when school is not in session and during holiday periods, which can increase the operating costs of the program and impact results of operations. We may be unable to adjust our expenses on a short-term basis to minimize the effect of these fluctuations in revenue. Our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate based upon the number and timing of child care center openings and/or closings, the timing of new client service launches, acquisitions, the performance of new and existing child care and early education centers, the contractual arrangements under which child care centers are operated, the change in the mix of such contractual arrangements, competitive factors and general economic conditions. The inability of existing child care centers to maintain their current enrollment levels and profitability, the failure of newly opened child care centers to contribute to profitability and the failure to maintain and grow our other services could result in additional fluctuations in our future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis.\nHealth pandemics, natural disaster, sociopolitical or other catastrophic event could severely disrupt our business.\nA regional or global health pandemic, not unlike COVID-19, depending upon its duration and severity, could severely affect our business. Enrollment in our child care centers could experience sharp declines as families might avoid taking their children out in public in the event of a health pandemic, and local, regional or national governments might limit or ban public interactions to halt or delay the spread of diseases causing business disruptions and the temporary closure of our centers. Additionally, a health pandemic could also impair our ability to hire and maintain an adequate level of staff and may have a disproportionate impact on our business compared to other companies that depend less on the in-person provision of services.\nOther unforeseen events, including acts of violence, war, terrorism and other international, regional or local instability or conflicts (including labor issues), embargoes, natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, or other adverse weather and climate conditions, whether occurring in the United States or abroad, could restrict or disrupt our operations. Enrollment in our child care centers could experience sharp declines as families might avoid taking their children out in public as a result of one or more of these events.\nAdditionally, our information systems are essential to our back-up and educational advisory and other services segments as well as to the corporate departments that support our lines of business. If those systems are damaged, interrupted or cease to function properly or if our disaster recovery and business continuity plans fail, it may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nFinancing Related Risks\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness from borrowings outstanding under our senior secured credit facilities. Information on our debt is included in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 11, Credit Arrangements and Debt Obligations, to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur level of debt could have significant consequences, including:\n\u2022limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate needs, and increasing our cost of borrowing;\n\u2022requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other corporate purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for operations, capital expenditures, and acquisitions among other requirements; and\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in the industry in which we compete and placing us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors or competitors with comparable debt at more favorable interest rates.\nIn addition, borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities bear interest at variable rates. If market interest rates increase, variable rate debt will create higher interest service requirements, which could adversely affect our cash flows and impact future earnings. While we have entered into variable-to-fixed interest rate swap agreements and interest rate caps to limit our exposure to higher interest rates on a portion of our debt, and may enter into additional agreements in the future, any such agreements may not offer complete protection from this risk and may carry additional risks. For information regarding our sensitivity to changes in interest rates, refer to \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d in Item 7A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur senior secured credit facilities are subject to variable interest rates that are indexed to LIBOR. The United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, previously announced in July 2017 that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021; however, this has been extended until 2023. Our credit agreement provides for application of the current LIBOR rate and it is not currently possible to predict the effect of alternative reference rates or any other reforms to LIBOR that may be enacted. The expected discontinuation, reform, or replacement of LIBOR may result in fluctuating interest rates, or higher interest rates, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s interest expense and results of operations.\nThe terms of our indebtedness restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions.\nThe credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities contains a number of restrictive covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interest, including restrictions on our ability to incur certain liens, make investments and acquisitions, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make other distributions in respect of, or repurchase or redeem, capital stock, or enter into certain other types of contractual arrangements affecting our subsidiaries or indebtedness. In addition, the restrictive covenants in the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests, and we expect that the agreements governing any new senior secured credit facilities will contain similar requirements to satisfy financial condition tests and, with respect to any new revolving credit facility, maintain specified financial ratios, subject to certain conditions. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control.\nA breach of the covenants under the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities, or any replacement facility, could result in an event of default unless we obtain a waiver to avoid such default. If we are unable to obtain a waiver, we may suffer adverse effects on our operations, business and financial condition, and such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of or default under any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In the event our lenders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness.\nIndustry, Competition and Growth Risks\nA permanent shift in workforce demographics and office environments may result in decreased demand for center-based child care and have an adverse effect our results of operations.\nDuring the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, a substantial portion of the workforce, including parents of children we serve at our centers, transitioned from working in traditional office environments to working in \u201cvirtual\u201d or \u201chome\u201d offices, including in our primary markets of the United States, United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. While we expect that many employees will return to traditional office environments once the likelihood of exposure to COVID-19 is significantly reduced, some employers may continue to encourage their employees to maintain a remote or work-from-home presence or may permanently move all or a portion of their workforce to work remotely. While working parents continue to need child care regardless of their work location, there are no assurances that parents who work-from-home will continue to use our centers or will not require other part-time child care arrangements that accommodate different working arrangements. Additionally, we believe that as a result of COVID-19, more women have temporarily stepped back from the workforce and that traditional dual-career households may have temporarily decreased. A shift in workplace demographics where employees work-from-home on a part- or full-time basis, or a sustained decrease in the number of women or dual-career households in the workforce, may reduce demand for center-based child care or specific center locations as well as other service offerings. We may be unable to successfully meet changed client and parent demands and needs, which may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nThe growth of our business may be adversely affected if we do not implement our growth strategies and initiatives successfully or if we are unable to manage our growth or operations effectively.\nWe have expanded and are continuing to expand our operations, suite of services and client relationships, which has placed, and will continue to place, significant demands on our management and our operational, IT and financial infrastructure. Additionally, our ability to grow in the future will depend upon a number of factors, including the ability to develop and expand new and existing client relationships, to continue to provide and expand the high-quality services we offer, to hire and train qualified personnel, to expand and grow in existing and future markets, to develop and operationalize new service offerings, and to sustain operational excellence and efficiencies across all business lines. Achieving and sustaining growth requires the successful execution of our growth strategies, which may require the implementation of enhancements to customer-facing, operational and financial systems, expanded sales and marketing capacity, continuous updates to technology and improvements to processes and systems, and additional or new organizational resources. Given these challenges, we may be unable to manage our expanding operations effectively, or to maintain our growth, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nAcquisitions present many risks and may disrupt our operations. We also may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of the transaction.\nAcquisitions are an integral part of our growth strategy and we have made, and intend to continue to make, acquisitions to add centers, clients, new service offerings and complementary companies, products, or technologies, and from time to time may enter into other strategic transactions such as investments and joint ventures. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including potential difficulties in the integration of acquired operations, such as bringing new centers through the re-licensing or accreditation processes, successfully implementing our curriculum programs, integration of systems and technology, diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources in connection with an acquisition and its integration, loss of key employees or key service contract arrangements of the acquired operations, and failure of acquired operations to effectively and timely adopt our internal control processes and other policies. Additionally, the acquisition of new service offerings or emerging services may present operational and integration challenges, particularly with respect to companies that have significant or complex operations or that provide services where we do not have significant prior experience. With any acquisition, the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of the transaction may not be realized due to increased costs, undisclosed liabilities not covered by insurance or by the terms of the acquisition, write-offs or impairment charges relating to goodwill and other intangible assets, and other unexpected integration costs. We also may not have success in identifying, executing and integrating acquisitions in the future. The occurrence of any of these risks could have an impact on our business, results of operation, financial condition or cash flows, particularly in the event of a larger acquisition or concurrent acquisitions. For information on our acquisition growth strategy, see Item 1,\u201cBusiness - Our Competitive Strengths\u201d and \u201c- Our Growth Strategy.\u201d\nSignificant competition in our industry could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe compete for enrollment and sponsorship of our child care and early education centers in a highly-fragmented market. For enrollment, we compete with center-based child care (such as residential and worksite child care centers, full- and part-time nursery schools, private and public elementary schools and church-affiliated and other not-for-profit providers) as well as family child care (operated out of the caregiver\u2019s home). In addition, alternatives to organized child care, such as relatives and nannies caring for children, can represent lower cost options to our services. For sponsorship, we compete primarily with large community-based child care companies with divisions focused on employer sponsorship and with regional child care providers who target employer sponsorship. We believe that our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including quality of care, site convenience and cost. We often face a price disadvantage to our competition, which may have access to greater financial resources, greater name recognition or lower operating or compliance costs. In addition, certain competitors may be able to operate with little or no rental expense and sometimes do not comply or are not required to comply with the same health, safety and operational regulations with which we comply. Therefore, we may be unable to continue to compete successfully against current and future competitors.\nIn connection with our back-up care and educational advisory and other services segments, we face competition from existing providers and new entrants into the market. We believe our ability to compete in these markets is dependent on prices for services, quality and timeliness of service delivery, and our digital platforms and offerings. However, competitors may seek to provide alternative offerings or undercut pricing in these markets. If we are unable to maintain our competitive advantage, our growth could be adversely impacted and our future operating results negatively impacted.\nGovernmental universal child care benefit programs could reduce the demand for our services.\nNational, state or local child care benefit programs comprised primarily of subsidies in the form of tax credits or other direct government financial aid to parents provide us opportunities for expansion in additional markets. However, a universal benefit with governmentally mandated or provided child care could reduce the demand for early care services at our existing child care and early education centers due to the availability of lower cost care alternatives or could place downward pressure on the tuition and fees we charge, which could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. Additionally, changes in government support programs in our international jurisdictions, such as the reduction of government-funded tuition subsidies, could reduce the demand for our services in these markets, adversely impacting our results of operations.\nLitigation, Insurance, Tax and Regulatory Risks\nOur business activities subject us to litigation risks that may lead to significant reputational damage, monetary damages and other remedies and increase our litigation expense.\nBecause of the nature of our business, we may be subject to claims and litigation, including unasserted claims and matters, alleging negligence, inadequate supervision, illegal, inappropriate or abusive behavior, health and safety, or other grounds for liability arising from injuries or other harm to the people we serve, primarily children. We may also be subject to employee claims based on, among other things, discrimination, harassment or wrongful termination. These claims and lawsuits could result in damages and other costs that our insurance may be inadequate to cover or result in licensing suspensions or revocation. In addition to diverting our management resources, such allegations may result in publicity that may materially and adversely affect us, our brands and our reputation, regardless of the validity of any such allegations. Any such claim or the publicity resulting from claims may have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition including, without limitation, adverse effects caused by increased cost or decreased availability of insurance and decreased demand for our services from employer sponsors and families.\nOur international operations may be subject to additional risks related to litigation, including difficulties enforcing contractual obligations governed by foreign law due to differing interpretations of rights and obligations, limitations on the availability of insurance coverage and limits, compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting laws, new and potentially untested laws and judicial systems, and reduced or diminished protection of intellectual property. A substantial judgment against us or one of our subsidiaries could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nSignificant changes to the availability of, or increases in the cost of, insurance or our deductibles may negatively affect our profitability.\nWe currently maintain the following major types of commercial insurance policies: workers\u2019 compensation, commercial general liability (including coverage for sexual and physical abuse, and student accident coverage), professional liability, automobile liability, excess and \u201cumbrella\u201d liability, commercial property coverage, employment practices liability, commercial crime coverage, fiduciary liability, privacy breach/cyber liability and directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability. These policies are subject to various limitations, exclusions and deductibles. A portion of our general liability coverage is provided by our wholly-owned captive insurance company. There is no assurance that our insurance, particularly coverage for sexual and physical abuse, will adequately cover our claims, or continue to be readily available to us in the form or amounts we have been able to obtain in the past, and our insurance premiums could materially increase in the future as a consequence of conditions in the insurance business or in the child care industry.\nChanges in laws and regulations could impact the way we conduct business.\nOur child care and early education centers, back-up care, and educational advisory services are subject to numerous national, state and local regulations and licensing requirements. Although these regulations vary greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, government agencies generally review, among other areas, the adequacy of buildings and equipment, licensed capacity, adult-to-child ratios, educational qualifications and training of staff, record keeping, dietary program, daily curriculum, hiring practices, and compliance with changes in federal and local labor laws and regulations, health and safety standards and requirements, including COVID-19 protocols, and data privacy statutes. In addition to costs associated with compliance of changing laws and regulations, failure to comply with applicable regulations and requirements could subject us to governmental sanctions, which can include fines, corrective orders, probation or, in more serious cases, suspension or revocation of one or more of our child care centers\u2019 licenses to operate, and require significant expenditures to bring those centers into compliance.\nOur tax rate is dependent on a number of factors, a change in any of which could impact our future tax rates and net income.\nAs a global company, we are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, and our future tax rates and operations may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including: changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate; changes in the estimated realization of our deferred tax assets and settlement of our deferred tax liabilities; changes in the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed; incremental taxes upon repatriation of non-U.S. earnings; adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes, including impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions; changes in available tax credits; and the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities. Losses for which no tax benefits can be recorded could materially impact our tax rate and its volatility from one quarter to another. Any significant change in our jurisdictional earnings mix or in the tax laws in those jurisdictions could impact our future tax rates and net income in those periods and any increases in income tax rates or changes in income tax laws could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\nInternational Risks\nThe success of our operations in international markets is highly dependent on the expertise of local management and operating staff, as well as the political, social, legal and economic operating conditions of each country in which we operate.\nThe success of our business depends on the actions of our employees. In our international locations, we are highly dependent on our local management and operating staff to operate our centers in these markets in accordance with local law and best practices. If the local management or operating staff were to leave our employment, we would have to expend significant time and resources building up our management or operational expertise in these local markets. Such a transition could adversely affect our reputation in these markets and could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe are also subject to inherent risks attributed to operating in a global economy. As of December 31, 2020, we had 363 centers located in three foreign countries - United Kingdom, Netherlands and India. If the international markets in which we compete are affected by changes in political, social, legal, economic, or other factors, such as the economic and political uncertainty resulting from the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union (commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d) and the global economic impact from the current COVID-19 health crisis, our business and operating results may be materially and adversely affected. Uncertainty as a result of Brexit or COVID-19 may last for years and could also impact our clients\u2019 businesses and operations. Our international operations may subject us to additional risks that differ in each country in which we operate and such risks may negatively affect our results. The factors impacting the international markets in which we operate may include changes in laws and regulations affecting the operation of child care centers, parent or tuition subsidies or other government financial support, the imposition of restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds, or increases in the taxes paid and other changes in applicable tax laws.\nOur business is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which could adversely impact our results.\nAs a multinational company, we conduct our business in a variety of markets and are therefore subject to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Instability in European financial markets or other events, such as the economic uncertainty resulting from Brexit and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, could cause fluctuations in exchange rates that may adversely affect our revenues and net earnings. Approximately 23% of our revenue was generated outside the United States in 2020. While most of our revenues, costs and debts are denominated in U.S. dollars, revenues and costs from our operations outside of the United States are denominated in the currency of the country in which the services are provided, and these currencies could become less valuable as a result of exchange rate fluctuations. Such changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nMarket Related Risks\nWe cannot guarantee that we will repurchase our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program or that our stock repurchase program will enhance long-term stockholder value. Stock repurchases could also increase the volatility of the price of our common stock and could diminish our cash reserves.\nWe have a share repurchase program pursuant to which the Company was authorized to repurchase shares of our common stock up to a total repurchase price of $300 million, of which $194.9 million remained available at December 31, 2020. Although our board of directors has authorized the stock repurchase program, the stock repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares and may be suspended or terminated at any time. Stock may be purchased from time to time, in the open market or through private transactions, subject to market conditions, in compliance with applicable state and federal securities laws. The timing and amount of repurchases, if any, will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, restrictions in our debt agreements, the trading price of our common stock and the nature of other investment opportunities. In addition, repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program could affect the market price of our common stock or increase its volatility. The existence of a stock repurchase program could cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. Additionally, our stock repurchase program could diminish our cash reserves, which may impact our ability to finance future growth and to pursue possible future strategic opportunities and acquisitions. There can be no assurance that any stock repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we determine to repurchase our stock. There is no assurance that our stock repurchase program will enhance long-term stockholder value and short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program\u2019s effectiveness.\nOur stock price could be extremely volatile, and, as a result, you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid for them.\nThe price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of factors, including those described elsewhere herein and others such as:\n\u2022variations in our operating performance and the performance of our competitors;\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u2022publication of research reports by securities analysts about us, our competitors, or our industry;\n\u2022our failure or the failure of our competitors to meet analysts\u2019 projections or guidance that we or our competitors may give to the market;\n\u2022additions and departures of key personnel;\n\u2022strategic decisions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestitures, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments, or changes in business strategy;\n\u2022the passage of legislation or other regulatory developments affecting us or our industry;\n\u2022speculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022changes in accounting principles;\n\u2022terrorist acts, acts of war, or periods of widespread civil unrest;\n\u2022pandemics, natural disasters and other calamities; and\n\u2022changes in general market and economic conditions.\nThe stock market in general can be highly volatile. As a result, the market price of our common stock may be similarly volatile, and investors in our common stock may experience a decrease, which could be substantial, in the value of their stock, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects, and could lose part or all of their investment.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has often been initiated against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources, and could also require us to make substantial payments to satisfy judgments or to settle litigation.\nYour percentage ownership in us may be diluted by future issuances of capital stock, which could reduce your influence over matters on which stockholders vote.\nPursuant to our restated bylaws, our board of directors has the authority, without action or vote of our stockholders, to issue all or any part of our authorized but unissued shares of common stock, including shares issuable upon the exercise of options, or shares of our authorized but unissued preferred stock. Issuances of common stock or voting preferred stock would reduce your influence over matters on which our stockholders vote and, in the case of issuances of preferred stock, would likely result in your interest in us being subject to the prior rights of holders of that preferred stock.\nProvisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may deter takeover efforts that could be beneficial to stockholder value.\nOur certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders. These provisions include a classified board of directors and limitations on actions by our stockholders, including the need for super majority approval to amend, alter, change or repeal specified provisions of our certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws, a prohibition on the ability of our stockholders to act by written consent and certain limitations on the ability of our stockholders to call a special meeting. In addition, our board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval that could be used to dilute a potential hostile acquiror. Our certificate of incorporation also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock other than Bain Capital Partners LLC. As a result, you may lose your ability to sell your stock for a price in excess of the prevailing market price due to these protective measures, and efforts by stockholders to change our direction or management may be unsuccessful.\nOur certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that, subject to limited exceptions, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws, or (iv) any other action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of our certificate of incorporation described above. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nThe exclusive forum provision in our certificate of incorporation does not apply to claims brought pursuant to United States federal securities laws including the Exchange Act or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The exclusive forum provision in our certificate of incorporation will not relieve us of our duty to comply with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder, and stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with these laws, rules and regulations.", "PERMNO": 85531, "SIC": 8351, "TIC": "BFAM"}
