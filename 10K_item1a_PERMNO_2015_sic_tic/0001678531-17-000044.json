{"cik": "1678531", "company": "Envision Healthcare Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following factors affect our business and the segments in which we operate. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us. If any of the matters discussed in the following risk factors were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger. The success of the Merger will depend on, among other things, our ability to combine the legacy AmSurg and EHH businesses in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities and realizes anticipated synergies, revenue and earnings growth projections. We expect to benefit from operational synergies resulting from the consolidation of capabilities and elimination of redundancies, as well as greater efficiencies from increased scale and integration. Management also expects that we will enjoy other benefits, including expanded service offerings, cross-selling opportunities, and increased geographic reach of the combined businesses.\nHowever, our management must successfully combine the legacy businesses of AmSurg and EHH in a manner that permits these cost savings, synergies and other benefits to be realized. Actual synergies may be lower than we currently expect, or may take longer to achieve than anticipated. In addition, we must achieve the anticipated savings, synergies and benefits without adversely affecting current revenues, earnings and investments in future growth. An inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the Merger, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could have an adverse effect upon our revenues, earnings, level of expenses and operating results, which may adversely affect the value of our common and preferred stock.\nWe have commenced a strategic review of our business lines, and may pursue strategic initiatives in the future. Strategic initiatives could include divestitures, acquisitions, spin-offs, split-offs, strategic partnerships or joint ventures. Any strategic initiatives could involve implementation challenges, execution risks or other risks, or significantly change our business profile or strategies. Any such strategic initiatives could have an adverse impact on our revenues, earnings, cash flows and operating results, which may adversely affect the value of our common and preferred stock.\nCombining the businesses of AmSurg and EHH may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than expected, which may adversely affect our results and negatively affect the value of our common and preferred stock. Our management may face significant challenges in successfully integrating the AmSurg and EHH businesses, including in particular the physician services segment, integrating the organizations, procedures, policies and operations, addressing differences in the business cultures and retaining key personnel. The integration may be complex and time consuming, and could require substantial resources and effort by management and others. The ongoing integration process may also disrupt our business or cause inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our relationships with employees, business partners, customers and others with whom we have business or other dealings, or limit our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Merger. In addition, any difficulties in integrating the businesses could harm our reputation. If we are unable to successfully combine the businesses of AmSurg and EHH in an efficient, effective and timely manner, the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Merger may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, and the value of our common and preferred stock may be affected adversely.\nChanges to payment rates or methods of third-party payors, including government healthcare programs, changes to the laws and regulations that regulate payments for medical services, the failure of payment rates to increase as our costs increase, or changes to our payor mix, could adversely affect our operating margins and revenues. We provide physician services, medical transportation services and ambulatory services primarily through fee for service payor arrangements. Under these arrangements, we collect fees directly or through our affiliated physicians or through the entities at which physician services are provided. We assume financial risks related to changes in third-party reimbursement rates and changes in payor mix. In some cases, our revenue decreases if our volume or reimbursement decreases, but our expenses may not decrease proportionately. Further, we collect a smaller portion of our fees for services rendered to uninsured patients than for services rendered to insured patients. Our credit risk related to services provided to uninsured individuals is exacerbated with respect to ED physician services, because of legal requirements that hospitals screen and stabilize or transfer all ED patients seeking care for an emergency medical condition regardless of a patient\u2019s ability to pay, and with respect to medical transportation that communities provide all emergency response services, regardless of a patient's ability to pay.\nWe depend primarily on private and governmental third-party sources of payment for the services provided to patients. The amount we receive for our services may be adversely affected by market and cost factors as well as other factors over which we have no control, including changes to the Medicare and Medicaid payment systems. Health reform efforts at the federal and state levels may increase the likelihood of significant changes affecting government healthcare programs and private insurance coverage. The future of the Health Reform Law, in particular, was cast into significant uncertainty by the results of the 2016 federal elections. Government healthcare programs are subject to, among other things, statutory and regulatory changes, administrative rulings, interpretations and determinations concerning patient eligibility requirements, funding levels and the method of calculating payments or reimbursements,\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - (continued)\nall of which could materially increase or decrease payments we receive from these government programs. Any such change that limits reimbursement amounts or practices could also significantly affect hospitals, and consequently affect our physician services operations or require us to renegotiate contractual arrangements with our hospital clients. Further, Medicare reimbursement rates are increasingly used by private payors as benchmarks to establish commercial reimbursement rates and any adjustment in Medicare reimbursement rates may impact our reimbursement rates from such private payors as well.\nAs the Medicare program transitions away from fee for service payment models and toward value-based payment methodologies, we may be required to make additional investments to receive maximum Medicare reimbursement. For example, the Medicare Physician Quality Reporting System provides additional Medicare compensation to physicians who implement and report certain quality measures. Further, MACRA requires the establishment of the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System under which, beginning in 2019, physicians will receive payment incentives or reductions based on their performance with respect to clinical quality, resource use, clinical improvement activities, and meaningful use of electronic health records.\nThere are significant private and public sector pressures to restrain healthcare costs and to restrict reimbursement rates for medical services, and we believe that such pressures will continue. Many states are continuing to collect less revenue than they did in prior years, and as a result may face ongoing budget shortfalls and underfunded pension and other liabilities. Deteriorating financial conditions in the states in which we operate could lead to reduced or delayed funding for Medicaid programs, which may reduce or delay the reimbursement we receive for services provided. Major payors of healthcare, including federal and state governments and private insurers, have taken steps in recent years to monitor and control costs, eligibility for and use and delivery of healthcare services, and to revise payment methodologies. As part of their efforts to contain healthcare costs, purchasers increasingly are demanding discounted or global fee structures or the assumption by healthcare providers of all or a portion of the financial risk through shared risk, capitation and care management arrangements, often in exchange for exclusive or preferred participation in their benefit plans. Further, the ability of commercial payors to control healthcare costs may be enhanced by the increasing consolidation of insurance and managed care companies, which may reduce our ability to negotiate favorable contracts with such payors.\nWe expect efforts to impose greater discounts and more stringent cost controls by government and other payors to continue, thereby reducing the payments we receive for our services. The effect of cost containment trends will depend, in part, on our payor mix. We cannot assure you that we will be able to offset reduced operating margins through cost reductions, increased volume, the introduction of additional procedures or otherwise. In addition, we cannot assure you that future changes to reimbursement rates by government healthcare programs, cost containment measures by private third-party payors, including fixed fee schedules and capitated payment arrangements, or other factors affecting payments for healthcare services will not adversely affect our future revenues, operating margins, or profitability.\nWe are subject to decreases in our revenue and profit margin under our fee for service contracts and arrangements, where we bear the risk of changes in volume, payor mix and third-party reimbursement rates. In our fee for service arrangements, which represent substantially all of our revenues, we, or our affiliated physicians, collect the fees for physician services and transports. Under these arrangements, we assume financial risks related to changes in the mix of insured and uninsured patients and patients covered by government-sponsored healthcare programs, third-party reimbursement rates, and patient and transport volume. A substantial decrease in patient volume, an increase in the number of uninsured or underinsured patients or an increase in the number of patients covered by government healthcare programs, as opposed to commercial plans that have higher reimbursement levels, could reduce our profitability and adversely impact future growth. In some cases, our revenue decreases if our volume or reimbursement decreases, but our expenses may not decrease proportionately.\nWe collect a smaller portion of our fees for services rendered to uninsured patients than for services rendered to insured patients. Our credit risk related to services provided to uninsured individuals in our ED specialty area is exacerbated because the law requires communities to provide \u201c911\u201d emergency response services and hospital EDs to treat all patients presenting to the ED seeking care for an emergency medical condition regardless of their ability to pay. We also believe uninsured patients are more likely to seek care at hospital EDs because they frequently do not have a primary care physician with whom to consult.\nIf we are unable to increase procedure volume at our existing surgery centers, the operating margins and profitability of our ambulatory services segment could be adversely affected. Our growth strategy for our ambulatory services segment includes increasing our revenues and earnings primarily by increasing the number of procedures performed at our surgery centers. We seek to increase procedure volume at our surgery centers by increasing the number of physicians performing procedures at our surgery centers, obtaining new or more favorable managed care contracts, improving patient flow at our surgery centers, increasing the capacity at our surgery centers, promoting screening programs and increasing patient and physician awareness of our surgery centers. Procedure volume at our surgery centers may be adversely impacted by economic conditions, high unemployment rates, natural disasters and physicians who no longer utilize our surgery centers and other factors that may cause patients to delay or cancel\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - (continued)\nprocedures. We can give you no assurances that we will be successful at increasing or maintaining procedure volumes, revenues and operating margins at our surgery centers.\nOur revenue would be adversely affected if we lose existing contracts. A significant portion of our growth historically has resulted from increases in the number of patient encounters and fees for services we provide under existing contracts, the addition of new contracts and the increase in the number of emergency and non-emergency transports. Substantially all of our net revenue in our physician services and medical transportation segments was generated under contracts, including exclusive contracts. Our contracts with hospitals for physician services generally have terms of one to three years. The term of our contracts with communities to provide \u201c911\u201d services generally ranges from three to five years. Most of our contracts, including contracts with several of our significant client relationships, are terminable by either of the parties upon notice of as little as 30 days. Any of our contracts may not be renewed or, if renewed, may contain terms that are not as favorable to us as our current contracts. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in retaining our existing contracts on comparable or better terms, if at all, or that any loss of contracts would not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, certain of our contracts will expire during each fiscal period, and we may be required to seek renewal of these contracts through a formal bidding process that often requires written responses to a RFP. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in retaining such contracts or that we will retain them on terms that are as favorable as present terms.\nOur physician services segment has several significant client relationships that result in a concentration of revenue. Although we negotiate and enter into separate contracts with facilities to which we deliver physician services, many facilities are affiliated with one another or owned and operated by the same entity. Although no single facility contract comprised more than 10% of consolidated net revenue, we have several significant client relationships with groups of affiliated facilities that result in a concentration of revenue. During 2016, on a pro forma basis assuming the Merger had been completed on January 1, 2016, facilities affiliated with HCA Holdings Inc. (HCA) comprised approximately 14.3% of our consolidated net revenue. The loss or reduction of business from any of our significant client relationships could materially adversely affect the revenues and results of operations of our physician services segment.\nWe may not accurately assess the costs we will incur under new contracts. Many of our contracts in our physician services and medical transportation segments involve a competitive bidding process. When we obtain new contracts, we must accurately assess the costs we will incur in providing services in order to realize adequate profit margins and otherwise meet our financial and strategic objectives. Increasing pressures from healthcare payors to restrict or reduce reimbursement rates at a time when the costs of providing medical services continue to increase make assessing the costs associated with the pricing of new contracts, as well as maintenance of existing contracts, more difficult. Entering into new contracts in a number of our service lines may also negatively impact cash flow as we absorb various expenses before we are able to bill and collect revenue associated with the new contracts. In addition, integrating new contracts, particularly those in new geographic locations, could prove more costly, and could require more management time, than we anticipate. Our failure to accurately predict costs or to negotiate an adequate profit margin could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to successfully recruit and retain physicians and other healthcare professionals with the qualifications and attributes desired by us, our customers, and our surgery centers. Our ability to recruit and retain qualified physicians and other healthcare professionals to staff contracts in our physician services business and to utilize our surgery centers in our ambulatory services business significantly affects our ability to provide quality care. We compete with other entities to recruit qualified physicians and other healthcare professionals. In many of the markets in which we operate, there are shortages of physicians in the targeted specialties of our physician services contracts and our surgery centers. Some of our competitors may have greater resources than we do, including financial, marketing, staff and capital resources, have or may develop new technologies or services that are attractive to physicians or patients, or have established relationships with physicians and payors.\nIn our physician services segment, our customer hospitals have increasingly demanded a greater degree of specialized skills, training and experience in the healthcare professionals providing services under their contracts with us. This decreases the number of healthcare professionals who may be qualified to staff our contracts. Moreover, because of the scope of the geographic and demographic diversity of the facilities with which we contract, we must recruit healthcare professionals, and particularly physicians, to staff a broad spectrum of specialty areas. We have had difficulty in the past recruiting physicians to staff contracts in some regions of the country and at some less economically advantaged hospitals. Our future success in retaining and winning new hospital contracts depends in part on our ability to recruit and retain physicians and other healthcare professionals to maintain and expand our operations.\nIn our ambulatory services segment, we also compete with other healthcare providers in recruiting physicians to utilize our surgery centers, for patients, and in contracting with managed care payors. In several of our markets, hospitals are directly recruiting physicians or groups of physicians as employees, including primary care physicians and physicians in the targeted specialties of our\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - (continued)\nsurgery centers, and restricting those physicians\u2019 ability to refer patients to physicians and facilities not affiliated with the hospital. In addition, physicians, hospitals, payors and other providers may form integrated delivery systems or utilize plan structures that restrict the physicians who may treat certain patients or the facilities at which patients may be treated. These restrictions may impact our surgery centers and the medical practices of our physician partners.\nOur non-compete agreements and other restrictive covenants involving physicians and other clinical employees may not be enforceable. We have contracts with physicians, other health professionals, and PCs in many states. Some of these contracts, as well as our contracts with hospitals, include provisions preventing these providers and professional corporations from competing with us both during and after the term of our relationship with them. The law governing non-compete agreements and other forms of restrictive covenants varies from state to state. Some states are reluctant to strictly enforce non-compete agreements and restrictive covenants applicable to physicians and other clinicians. There can be no assurance that our non-compete agreements related to physicians, other healthcare professionals, and professional corporations will not be successfully challenged as unenforceable in certain states. In such event, we would be unable to prevent these clinicians and PCs from competing with us, potentially resulting in the loss of some of our hospital contracts and other business.\nIf we fail to implement our business strategy, our financial performance and our growth could be materially and adversely affected. Our future financial performance and success are dependent in large part upon our ability to implement our business strategy successfully. Our business strategy includes several initiatives, including capitalizing on organic growth opportunities, growing complementary and integrated services lines, supplementing organic growth with strategic initiatives, and enhancing operational efficiencies and productivity. We may not be able to implement our business strategy successfully or achieve the anticipated benefits of our business strategy. If we are unable to do so, our long-term growth, profitability, and ability to service our debt will be adversely affected. Even if we are able to implement some or all of the initiatives of our business strategy successfully, our operating results may not improve to the extent we anticipate, or at all. Implementation of our business strategy could also be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, such as changes in government regulation, increased competition, legal developments, general economic conditions or increased operating costs or expenses. In addition, to the extent we have misjudged the nature and extent of sector trends or our competition, we may have difficulty in achieving our strategic objectives.\nOur margins may be negatively impacted by cross-selling to existing customers or selling bundled services to new customers. One of our growth strategies involves the continuation and expansion of our efforts to sell complementary services across our businesses. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in our cross-selling efforts. As part of our cross-selling efforts, we may need to offer a bundled package of services that are at a lower price point to existing or new customers as compared to the price of individual services or otherwise offer services which may put downward price pressure on our services. Such price pressure may have a negative impact on our operating margins. In addition, if a complementary service offered as part of a bundled package underperforms as compared to the other services included in such package, we could face reputational harm which could negatively impact our relationships with our customers and ultimately our results of operations.\nWe may enter into partnerships with payors and other healthcare providers, including risk-based partnerships under the Health Reform Law as currently enacted. If this strategy is not successful, our financial performance could be adversely affected. We have entered into strategic business partnerships with hospital systems and other large payors to take advantage of commercial opportunities in our facility-based physician services business. However, there can be no assurance that our efforts in these areas will continue to be successful. Moreover, joint venture and strategic partnership models may expose us to commercial risks that may be different from our other business models, including that the success of the joint venture or partnership may be only partially under our operational and legal control and the opportunity cost of not pursuing the specific venture independently or with other partners.\nFor example, our physician services segment has entered into joint venture agreements with HCA to provide physician services to various healthcare facilities. In these joint ventures, HCA has the option to acquire our stake in the venture on a predetermined financial formula, which, if exercised, would lead to the loss of our associated revenue and profits which may not be offset fully by the immediate proceeds of the sale of our stake. Additionally, under certain of our joint venture partnership arrangements, the hospital system partner has the right of first refusal should we desire to acquire an unrelated provider who derives 40% or more of their revenues from services provided to that hospital system or its affiliates. Furthermore, joint ventures may raise fraud and abuse issues. For example, the OIG has taken the position that certain contractual joint ventures between a party which makes referrals and a party which receives referrals for a specific type of service may violate the Anti-Kickback Statute if one purpose of the arrangement is to encourage referrals.\nWe have entered into, and in the future expect to enter into, risk-based partnerships and arrangements designed to encourage healthcare providers to assume financial accountability for outcomes and work together to better coordinate care for patients, both in the hospital and after discharge. Examples of such opportunities include CMS initiatives such as the CMS Bundled Payments for Care Improvement initiative, the Medicare Shared Savings Program and the Independence at Home Demonstration, as well as agreements\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - (continued)\nentered into by our physician services business with health plans that include risk-based incentives tied to outcomes. We view entering into targeted risk-based initiatives, including opportunities afforded by the Health Reform Law, as currently enacted, as an important part of our business strategy in order to develop our integrated service offerings across the patient continuum, continue the expansion of our physician services business, further develop our relationships with hospitals, hospital systems and other payors, and prepare for the possibility that Medicare may require us to participate in a capitated or value-based payment system for certain of our businesses in the future.\nAdvancing such initiatives can be time consuming and expensive, and there can be no assurance that our efforts in these areas will ultimately be successful. If we succeed in our efforts to enter into these risk-based partnerships but fail to deliver quality care at a cost consistent with our expectations, we may be subject to significant financial penalties depending on the program, and an unsuccessful implementation of such initiatives could materially and adversely affect our ability to enter into other risk-based partnerships and our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe could be subject to lawsuits which could harm the value of our business, including litigation for which we are not fully reserved. From time-to-time we are involved in lawsuits, claims, audits and investigations, including those arising out of services provided, personal injury claims, professional liability claims, billing and marketing practices, employment disputes and contractual claims. Physicians, hospitals and other participants in healthcare delivery have become subject to an increasing number of lawsuits alleging medical malpractice and related legal theories such as negligent hiring, supervision and credentialing. Similarly, medical transport services may be involved in lawsuits concerning vehicle collisions and personal injuries, patient care incidents or mistreatment and employee job-related injuries. Some of these lawsuits may involve large claim amounts and substantial defense costs.\nOur physician services segment generally procures professional liability insurance coverage for its employed and affiliated medical professionals, and professional and corporate entities. A substantial portion of our professional liability loss risks are provided by third-party insurers, which is fully reinsured by our wholly owned captive insurance entities. In addition, our wholly owned captives provide stop loss coverage for our self-insured employee health program related to our physician services segment. Our medical transportation business currently has an insurance program which includes a combination of insurance purchased from third parties and large self-insured retentions and/or deductibles for all of its insurance programs subsequent to September 1, 2001. Our medical transportation business reinsures a portion of these self-insured retentions and/or deductibles through an arrangement with EMCA. Under these insurance programs, we establish reserves, using actuarial estimates, for all losses covered under the policies. Liabilities for claims incurred but not reported are not discounted. Moreover, in the normal course of our business, we are involved in lawsuits, claims, audits and investigations, including those arising out of our billing and marketing practices, employment disputes, contractual claims and other business disputes for which we may have no insurance coverage, and which are not subject to actuarial estimates. The outcome of these matters could have a material effect on our results of operations in the period when we identify the matter, and the ultimate outcome could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Our liability to pay for our physician services and medical transportation segments\u2019 insurance program losses is partially collateralized by funds held through our wholly owned insurance captives, and letters of credit issued by our affiliates and, to the extent these losses exceed such collateral, or the limits of our insurance policies, we will be required to fund any remaining liabilities.\nWe may become subject to future lawsuits, claims, audits and investigations that could result in substantial costs and divert our attention and resources and adversely affect our business condition. In addition, since our current growth strategy includes acquisitions, among other things, we may become exposed to legal claims for the activities of an acquired business prior to the acquisition. These lawsuits, claims, audits or investigations, regardless of their merit or outcome, may also adversely affect our reputation and ability to expand our business.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulatory regimes, including a variety of labor laws and regulations. Failure to comply with laws and regulations could subject us to, among other things, penalties and legal expenses which could have a materially adverse effect on our business. We are subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations including, but not limited to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and regulations promulgated by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the U.S. Department of Labor and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. We are also subject to a variety of federal and state employment and labor laws and regulations, including the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act, the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, and other regulations related to working conditions, wage-hour pay, overtime pay, family leave, employee benefits, antidiscrimination, termination of employment, safety standards and other workplace regulations.\nFailure to properly adhere to these and other applicable laws and regulations could result in investigations, the imposition of penalties or adverse legal judgments by public or private plaintiffs, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - (continued)\nmaterially adversely affected. Similarly, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the cost of complying with newly-implemented laws and regulations.\nIn addition, from time to time we have received, and expect to continue to receive, correspondence from former employees terminated by us who threaten to bring claims against us alleging that we have violated one or more labor and employment regulations. In certain instances former employees have brought claims against us and we expect that we will encounter similar actions against us in the future. An adverse outcome in any such litigation could require us to pay contractual damages, compensatory damages, punitive damages, attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.\nThe reserves we establish with respect to our losses covered under our insurance programs are subject to inherent uncertainties.\nIn connection with our insurance programs, we establish reserves for losses and related expenses, which represent estimates involving actuarial and statistical projections, at a given point in time, of our expectations of the ultimate resolution and administration costs of losses we will incur in respect of our liability risks. The estimation of professional liabilities is inherently complex and subjective, as these claims are typically resolved over an extended period of time, often as long as ten years or more. Our reserves are based on historical claims, demographic factors, sector trends, severity and exposure factors and other actuarial assumptions calculated by an independent actuarial firm. The independent actuarial firm performs studies of projected ultimate losses on an annual basis and we utilize these actuarial estimates to determine appropriate reserves. Our reserves could be significantly affected if current and future occurrences differ from historical claim trends and expectations. While we monitor claims closely when we estimate reserves, the complexity of the claims and the wide range of potential outcomes may hamper timely adjustments to the assumptions we use in these estimates. Actual losses and related expenses may deviate, individually and in the aggregate, from the reserve estimates reflected in our consolidated financial statements. The long-term portion of insurance reserves was $370.5 million as of December 31, 2016. If we determine that our estimated reserves are inadequate, we will be required to increase reserves at the time of the determination, which would result in a reduction in our net income in the period in which the deficiency is determined.\nMany of our medical transportation segment\u2019s employees are represented by labor unions and any work stoppage could adversely affect our business. Approximately 43% of our medical transportation segment employees are represented by 71 active collective bargaining agreements. There are 33 operational locations representing approximately 4,600 employees currently in the process of negotiations or will be subject to negotiation in 2017. In addition, 14 collective bargaining agreements, representing approximately 4,600 employees will be subject to negotiations in 2018. While we believe we maintain a good working relationship with our employees, we have experienced some union work actions. We cannot assure you that we will be able to negotiate a satisfactory renewal of these collective bargaining agreements or that our employee relations will remain stable.\nWe may make acquisitions which could divert the attention of management and may not be integrated successfully into our existing business. A portion of our growth has resulted from, and is expected to continue to result from, the acquisition of physician groups, surgery centers, medical transportation providers and other healthcare providers and businesses. We may continue to pursue acquisitions to increase our presence in existing markets, enter new geographic markets and expand the scope of services we provide. In 2016, on a combined basis with EHH, we completed 22 acquisitions for total purchase consideration of approximately $600 million. We have evaluated, and expect to continue to evaluate, possible acquisitions on an ongoing basis, and such acquisition targets may be of significant size and may involve operations in multiple jurisdictions. We cannot assure you that we will identify suitable acquisition candidates, acquisitions will be completed on acceptable terms or at all, our due diligence process will uncover all potential liabilities or issues affecting our integration process, we will not incur break-up, termination or similar fees and expenses, or we will obtain all necessary or expected consents from third parties. We cannot assure you that we will be able to integrate successfully the operations of any acquired business into our existing business. In particular, we may experience challenges relating to the retention of physicians and other healthcare professionals of our acquired businesses or the integration of such healthcare professionals. Furthermore, acquisitions in new geographic markets and services may require us to comply with new and unfamiliar legal and regulatory requirements, which could impose substantial obligations on us and our management, cause us to expend additional time and resources becoming familiar with such requirements, and increase our exposure to penalties or fines for non-compliance with such requirements. The acquisition and integration of another business could divert management attention from other business activities. This diversion, together with other difficulties we may incur in integrating an acquired business, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends on our ability to manage growth effectively. Even if we are successful in obtaining new business, organically or by acquisition, failure to manage our growth effectively could adversely affect our financial condition. We may experience extended periods of very rapid growth, and if we are not able to manage our growth effectively, our business and financial condition could materially suffer. Our growth may significantly strain our managerial, operational and financial resources and systems. To manage our growth effectively, we will have to continue to implement and improve our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures. In addition, we must effectively expand, train and manage our employees. We will be unable to manage our businesses effectively if we are unable to alleviate the strain on resources caused by growth in a timely and successful manner.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - (continued)\nThe high level of competition in our lines of business could adversely affect our contract and revenue base for our physician services, medical transportation and ambulatory services segments.\nPhysician Services. Physician staffing and related management services to hospitals and clinics are highly competitive. We compete with both national and regional enterprises such as Team Health Holdings, Inc., Mednax Inc., The Schumacher Group, Fresenius Medical Care, California Emergency Physicians and National Emergency Services Healthcare Group, some of which may have greater financial and other resources available to them, greater access to physicians or greater access to potential customers. Such competition could adversely affect our ability to obtain new facility contracts, retain existing contracts and increase or maintain profit margins. We also compete against local physician groups and self-operated facility-based physician services departments that also provide staffing and scheduling services. Many of these competitors provide healthcare services that are similar in scope to the services we provide. Moreover, in certain regions, some of our competitors have already established a significant network of physician groups and it may be more difficult for us to compete in such areas.\nMedical Transportation. The medical transportation services business is highly competitive. In providing medical transportation services, we compete with governmental entities, including cities and fire districts, hospitals, local and volunteer private providers, and with several large national and regional providers such as Falck, Paramedics Plus, Acadian Ambulance, Superior Ambulance, and Priority Ambulance. In many communities, our most significant competitors are the local fire departments, which in many cases have acted traditionally as the first response providers during emergencies. Many of these local fire departments have been able to expand their scope of services to include emergency ambulance transport and do not wish to give up their franchises to a private competitor.\nAmbulatory Surgery Centers. The ASC business is highly competitive. We compete with hospitals and other surgery centers in recruiting physicians to utilize our surgery centers, for patients and for the opportunity to contract with payors. We compete with public and private companies in the development and acquisition of ASCs, including Surgery Partners Inc., Surgical Care Affiliates, Inc., United Surgical Partners, Inc. and various hospital systems. Further, many physician groups independently develop ASCs without a corporate partner.\nWe are required to make capital expenditures, particularly for our medical transportation business, in order to remain compliant and competitive. Our capital expenditure requirements primarily relate to maintaining, upgrading or replacing our vehicle fleet, medical equipment and property to serve our customers and remain competitive. The aging of our vehicle fleet used in our medical transportation business requires us to make regular capital expenditures to maintain our current level of service. Our net capital expenditures totaled $99.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition, changing competitive conditions or the emergence of any significant advances in medical technology could require us to invest significant capital in additional equipment or capacity in order to remain competitive. If we are unable to fund any such investment or otherwise fail to invest in new vehicles or medical equipment, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business depends on numerous complex information systems, and any failure to successfully maintain these systems or implement new systems could materially harm our operations. We depend on complex, integrated information systems and standardized procedures for operational and financial information and our billing operations. We may not have the necessary resources to enhance existing information systems or implement new systems where necessary to handle our volume and changing needs. Furthermore, we may experience unanticipated delays, complications and expenses in implementing, upgrading, integrating and operating our systems, which involve a variety of different processes. Any interruptions in operations during periods of implementation or upgrading could adversely affect our ability to properly allocate resources and process billing information in a timely manner, which could result in customer dissatisfaction and delayed cash flow. We also use the development and implementation of sophisticated and specialized technology to differentiate our services from our competitors and improve our profitability. The failure to successfully implement, maintain and protect operational, financial and billing information systems could have an adverse effect on our ability to report our required financial information in a timely and accurate manner, obtain new business, retain existing business and maintain or increase our profit margins.\nDisruptions in our disaster recovery systems, management continuity planning or information systems could limit our ability to operate our business effectively, or adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our information technology systems facilitate our ability to conduct our business. While we have disaster recovery systems and business continuity plans in place, any disruptions in our disaster recovery systems or the failure of these systems to operate as expected could, depending on the magnitude of the problem, adversely affect our operating results by limiting our capacity to effectively monitor and control our operations. Despite our implementation of a variety of security measures, our technology systems could be subject to physical or electronic break-ins, and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering. In addition, in the event that a significant number of our\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - (continued)\nmanagement personnel were unavailable in the event of a disaster, our ability to effectively conduct business could be adversely affected.\nInformation security risks have generally increased in recent years because of new technologies and the increased incidence of cyber-attacks resulting in the theft of protected health, business or financial information. Outside parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce our employees to release confidential or sensitive information or to make fraudulent payments, through illegal electronic tactics. A failure in or breach of our information systems as a result of cyber-attacks or other tactics could disrupt our business, result in the release or misuse of confidential or proprietary or financial information, damage our reputation, increase our administrative expenses, and expose us to additional risk of liability to federal or state governments or individuals. Although we believe that we have robust information security procedures and other safeguards in place, which are monitored and routinely tested internally and by external parties, as cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. Any of these disruptions or breaches of security could have a material adverse effect on our business, regulatory compliance, financial condition and results of operations.\nA successful challenge by tax authorities to our treatment of certain healthcare professionals as independent contractors or the elimination of an existing safe harbor could materially increase our costs relating to these healthcare professionals. As of December 31, 2016, we contracted with approximately 7,900 physicians and clinical personnel as independent contractors. Because we treat these providers as independent contractors rather than as employees, we do not (i) withhold federal or state income or other employment related taxes from the compensation that we pay to them, (ii) make federal or state unemployment tax or Federal Insurance Contributions Act payments with respect to them, (iii) provide workers compensation insurance with respect to them (except in states that require us to do so for independent contractors), or (iv) allow them to participate in benefits and retirement programs available to our employees. Our contracts with these healthcare professionals obligate them to pay these taxes and other costs. Whether these healthcare professionals are properly classified as independent contractors generally depends upon the facts and circumstances of our relationship with them. It is possible that the nature of our relationship with these healthcare professionals would support a challenge to our treatment of them as independent contractors. Under current federal tax law, however, if our treatment of these healthcare professionals is consistent with a long-standing practice of a significant segment of our industry and we meet certain other requirements, it is possible, but not certain, that our treatment would qualify under a \u201csafe harbor\u201d and, consequently, we would be protected from the imposition of taxes. However, if a challenge to our treatment of these healthcare professionals as independent contractors by federal or state taxing authorities were successful and these healthcare professionals were treated as employees instead of independent contractors, we could be liable for taxes, penalties and interest to the extent that these healthcare professionals did not fulfill their contractual obligations to pay those taxes. In addition, there are currently, and have been in the past, proposals made to eliminate the safe harbor, and similar proposals could be made in the future. If such a challenge were successful or if the safe harbor were eliminated, there could be a material increase in our costs relating to these healthcare professionals and, therefore, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to successfully maintain an effective internal control over financial reporting, the integrity of our financial reporting could be compromised, which could result in a material adverse effect on our reported financial results. We regularly acquire closely held entities that are not subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the rules and regulations of the SEC, especially as it relates to internal control structure. As such, these closely held entities may not have previously implemented the internal controls required of a public company. The integration of acquired entities into our internal control over financial reporting has required and will continue to require significant time and resources from our management and other personnel and will increase our compliance costs. We are required to include our assessment of the effectiveness of the internal controls over financial reporting of entities we acquire in our overall assessment. We plan to complete the evaluation and integration of internal controls over financial reporting and report our assessment within the required time frame. Failure to maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our ability to accurately report our financial results, the market\u2019s perception of our business and our stock price.\nShortages of products, equipment and medical supplies and quality control issues with such products, equipment and medical supplies could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our operations and profitability. Our operations, particularly the operations of our ambulatory surgery center business, depend significantly upon our and our clients\u2019 ability to obtain sufficient products, drugs, equipment and medical supplies on a timely basis. If we or our clients are unable to obtain such necessary products, or if we or our clients fail to properly manage existing inventory levels, we may be unable to perform certain surgeries or provide certain medical services, which could adversely affect our operations. In addition, as a result of shortages, we could suffer, among other things, operational disruptions, disruptions in cash flows, increased costs and reductions in profitability. At times, supply shortages have occurred, and such shortages may be expected to recur from time to time.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - (continued)\nMedical supplies and services may be subject to supplier product quality control incidents and recalls. In addition to contributing to materials shortages, product quality can affect patient care and safety. National suppliers have experienced material quality control incidents in the past, which may occur again in the future for reasons beyond our control and such incidents can negatively impact case volume, product costs and our reputation. In addition, we may have to incur costs to resolve quality control incidents related to medical supplies and services regardless of whether they were caused by us. Our inability to obtain the necessary amount and quality of products, equipment and medical supplies due to a quality control incident or recall could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may write-off intangible assets, such as goodwill. As a result of purchase accounting for our various acquisition transactions, our balance sheet at December 31, 2016 contained intangible assets designated as either goodwill or intangibles totaling approximately $8.82 billion in goodwill and approximately $4.60 billion in intangibles. Acquisitions that result in the recognition of additional intangible assets would cause an increase in these intangible assets. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate whether facts and circumstances indicate any impairment of the value of intangible assets. As circumstances change, we cannot assure you that the value of these intangible assets will be realized by us. If we determine that a significant impairment has occurred, we will be required to write-off the impaired portion of intangible assets, including goodwill, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the write-off occurs.\nOur ambulatory services segment may be adversely affected by changes to the medical practices of our physician partners or if we fail to maintain good relationships with the physician partners who use our surgery centers. Our ambulatory services segment depends on, among other things, the efforts and success of the physician partners who perform procedures at our surgery centers and the strength of our relationship with these physicians. The medical practices of our physician partners may be negatively impacted by general economic conditions, changes in payment rates or systems by payors (including Medicare), actions taken by referring physicians, other providers and payors, and other factors impacting their practices. Adverse economic conditions, including high unemployment rates, could cause patients of our physician partners and our ASCs to cancel or delay procedures. Our physician partners that use our ASCs are not required to use our surgery centers and may perform procedures at other facilities. From time to time, we have had and may have future disputes with physicians in our surgery centers. The revenues and profitability of our ambulatory services segment may be adversely affected if a key physician or group of physicians stops using or reduces their use of our surgery centers as a result of changes in their physician practice, changes in payment rates or systems, or a disagreement with us. In addition, if the physicians who use our surgery centers do not provide quality medical care or follow required professional guidelines at our facilities or there is damage to the reputation of a physician or group of physicians who use our surgery centers, our business and reputation could be damaged.\nOur ambulatory services segment may be negatively impacted by weather and other factors beyond our control. The results of operations of our ambulatory services segment may be adversely impacted by adverse weather conditions, including hurricanes and widespread winter storms, or other factors beyond our control that cause disruption of patient scheduling, displacement of our patients, employees and physician partners, or force certain of our surgery centers to close temporarily. In certain geographic areas, we have a large concentration of surgery centers that may be simultaneously affected by adverse weather conditions or events. The future financial and operating results of our ambulatory services segment may be adversely affected by weather and other factors that disrupt the operation of our surgery centers.\nWe have a legal responsibility to the minority owners of the entities through which we own our surgery centers, which may conflict with our interests and prevent us from acting solely in our own best interests. As the owner of majority interests in the limited partnerships and limited liability companies that own our surgery centers, we owe a fiduciary duty to the noncontrolling interest holders in these entities and may encounter conflicts between our interests and that of the minority holders. In these cases, our representatives on the governing board of each partnership or joint venture are obligated to exercise reasonable, good faith judgment to resolve the conflicts and may not be free to act solely in our own best interests. In our role as manager of the limited partnership or limited liability company, we generally exercise our discretion in managing the business of the surgery center. Disputes may arise between us and the physician partners regarding a particular business decision or the interpretation of the provisions of the limited partnership agreement or limited liability company operating agreement. The agreements provide for arbitration as a dispute resolution process in some circumstances. We cannot assure you that any dispute will be resolved or that any dispute resolution will be on terms satisfactory to us.\nFailure to timely or accurately bill for services could have a negative impact on our net revenue, bad debt expense and cash flow. Billing for healthcare services is an important but complex aspect of our business. In particular, the current practice of providing physician and medical transportation services in advance of payment or, in many cases, irrespective of the patient's ability to pay for such services, may have significant negative impact on our physician services and medical transportation segment's net revenue, bad debt expense and cash flow. We bill numerous and varied payors, such as self-pay patients, managed care payors and Medicare and Medicaid. These different payors typically have different billing requirements that must be satisfied prior to receiving payment for\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - (continued)\nservices rendered. Reimbursement is typically conditioned on our documenting medical necessity, the appropriate level of service and correctly applying diagnosis codes. Incorrect or incomplete documentation and billing information could result in non-payment for services rendered.\nAdditional factors that could complicate our ability to timely or accurately bill payors include:\n\u2022\ndisputes between payors as to which party is responsible for payment;\n\u2022\nfailure of information systems and processes to submit and collect claims in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nvariation in coverage for similar services among various payors;\n\u2022\nour reliance on third-parties to provide billing services for certain of our service lines, including for our medical transportation services;\n\u2022\nthe difficulty of adherence to specific compliance requirements, diagnosis coding and other procedures mandated by various payors; and\n\u2022\nin connection with billing for physician services, failure to obtain proper physician credentialing and documentation in order to bill various payors.\nTo the extent that the complexity associated with billing for healthcare services we provide causes delays in our cash collections, we may experience increased carrying costs associated with the aging of our accounts receivable as well as increased potential for bad debt expense.\nUnfavorable changes in regulatory, economic and other conditions could occur in the states where our operations are concentrated. On a pro forma combined basis for the year ended December 31, 2016, assuming the Merger had been completed on January 1, 2016, Arizona, California, Florida, New Jersey and Texas accounted for approximately 64% of our physician services segment net revenue. This concentration increases the risk that, should our physician services segment programs in these states be adversely affected by changes in law or regulatory, economic and other conditions, our physician services segment revenue and profitability could materially decline. Furthermore, a natural disaster or other catastrophic event in one of these states could affect us more significantly than other companies with less geographic concentration.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights that are material to our business, or to defend successfully against intellectual property infringement claims by third parties. Our ability to compete effectively depends in part upon our intellectual property rights, including but not limited to our trademarks and copyrights, and our proprietary technology. Our use of contractual provisions, confidentiality procedures and agreements, and trademark, copyright, unfair competition, trade secret and other laws to protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary technology may not be adequate. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary technology, or to defend against claims by third parties that the conduct of our businesses or our use of intellectual property infringes upon such third-party\u2019s intellectual property rights. Any intellectual property litigation or claims brought against us, whether or not meritorious, could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources, and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in all cases. The terms of any settlement or judgment may require us to pay substantial amounts to the other party or cease exercising our rights in such intellectual property, including ceasing the use of certain trademarks used by us to distinguish our services from those of others or ceasing the exercise of our rights in copyrightable works. In addition, we may have to seek a license to continue practices found to be in violation of a third-party\u2019s rights, which may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected as a result.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - (continued)\nRisks Related to Our Substantial Indebtedness\nOur substantial indebtedness may adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from making payments on our indebtedness. We have substantial indebtedness. As of December 31, 2016, we had total indebtedness, including capital leases, of approximately $5.95 billion, including $1.10 billion of our 5.625% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2022, $750.0 million of our 5.125% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2022, $550.0 million of our 6.25% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2024, and $3.50 billion of borrowings under the senior secured term loan facility (\u201cTerm Loan Facility\u201d). In addition, as of December 31, 2016, after giving effect to approximately $133.9 million of letters of credit issued under the asset-based revolving credit facility (\u201cABL Facility\u201d), we have capacity to borrow approximately $677.3 million under our $850.0 million ABL Facility, subject to availability requirements. As of December 31, 2016, we also had approximately $861.2 million in operating lease commitments.\nThe degree to which we are leveraged may have important consequences for holders of our common and preferred stock. For example, it may:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to make payments on our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general economic and sector conditions, including recessions and periods of significant inflation and financial market volatility;\n\u2022\nexpose us to the risk of increased interest rates because any borrowings we make under the ABL Facility, and our borrowings under the Term Loan Facility under certain circumstances, will bear interest at variable rates;\n\u2022\nrequire us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other expenses;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds that may be needed to operate and expand our business.\nDespite our indebtedness levels, we, our subsidiaries and our affiliated professional corporations may be able to incur substantially more indebtedness which may increase the risks created by our substantial indebtedness. We, our subsidiaries and our affiliated professional corporations may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. The terms of the indentures governing our outstanding senior unsecured notes and the credit agreements governing the ABL Facility and the Term Loan Facility permit us to incur additional indebtedness, and do not fully prohibit our subsidiaries and our affiliated professional corporations from incurring indebtedness. If we are in compliance with certain incurrence ratios set forth in the credit agreements governing the ABL Facility and the Term Loan Facility and the indentures governing our outstanding senior unsecured notes, we, and our subsidiaries, may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness, which may increase the risks created by our current substantial indebtedness. Our affiliated professional corporations are not subject to the covenants governing any of our indebtedness.\nWe will require a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness. The ability to generate cash or refinance our indebtedness as it becomes due depends on many factors, some of which are beyond our control. We are a holding company, and as such we have no independent operations or material assets other than their ownership of equity interests in our subsidiaries and our subsidiaries\u2019 contractual arrangements with physicians and professional corporations. We depend on our subsidiaries to distribute funds to us so we are able to pay our obligations and expenses, including satisfying our indebtedness. Our ability to make scheduled payments on, or to refinance our obligations under, our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures and other corporate expenses will depend on the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions, dividends or advances, which in turn will depend on their future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors. Many of these factors are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, that currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness or to fund our other needs. In order for us to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness and fund our planned capital expenditures, we must continue to execute our business strategy. If we are unable to do so, we may need to reduce or delay our planned capital expenditures or refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. Significant delays in our planned capital expenditures may materially and adversely affect our future revenue prospects. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - (continued)\nThe indentures governing our senior notes and the credit agreements governing the ABL Facility and the Term Loan Facility restrict our ability to engage in certain business and financial transactions.\nIndentures. The indentures governing our senior notes contain restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares;\n\u2022\npay dividends on, redeem or repurchase stock or make other distributions in respect of the Company's capital stock;\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\nrepurchase, prepay or redeem subordinated indebtedness;\n\u2022\nincur additional liens;\n\u2022\ntransfer or sell assets;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with our affiliates; and\n\u2022\ndesignate any of our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.\n\u2022\nSenior Secured Credit Facilities. The credit agreements governing the ABL Facility and the Term Loan Facility (together, the \u201cSenior Secured Credit Facilities\u201d) contain a number of covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares;\n\u2022\npay dividends on, redeem or repurchase stock or make other distributions in respect of the Company's capital stock;\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\nrepurchase, prepay or redeem junior indebtedness;\n\u2022\nagree to payment restrictions affecting the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends to us or make other intercompany transfers;\n\u2022\nincur additional liens;\n\u2022\ntransfer or sell assets;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nmake negative pledges; and\n\u2022\ndesignate any of our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.\nThe credit agreement governing the ABL Facility also contains other covenants customary for asset-based facilities of this nature. Our ability to borrow additional amounts under the credit agreement governing the ABL Facility depends upon satisfaction of these covenants. Events beyond our control can affect our ability to meet these covenants.\nOur failure to comply with obligations under the indentures governing our senior notes and the credit agreements governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities may result in an event of default under those indentures or those credit agreements. A default, if not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of our indebtedness. We cannot be certain that we will have funds available to remedy these defaults. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds available to pay the accelerated indebtedness or that we will have the ability to refinance the accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us or at all. The operating and financial restrictions and covenants described above may adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities.\nAn increase in interest rates would increase the cost of servicing our debt and could reduce our profitability. Our indebtedness under the ABL Facility bears interest at variable rates and, to the extent the rate for deposits in U.S. dollars in the London interbank market (adjusted for maximum reserves) for the applicable interest period (LIBOR) exceeds 0.75%, our indebtedness under the Term Loan Facility bears interest at variable rates. As a result, increases in interest rates could increase the cost of servicing such debt and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows. As of December 31, 2016, assuming all ABL Facility revolving loans were fully drawn and LIBOR exceeded 0.75%; each percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an approximately $21.0 million increase in annual interest expense on the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. The impact of such an increase would be more significant for us than it would be for some other companies because of our substantial debt.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - (continued)\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock\nAnti-takeover provisions in our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws could discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common and preferred stock. Our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws include a number of provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable. For example, our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws collectively:\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by our Board of Directors to thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nprovide for the Company to be governed by Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), which affords the Company certain antitakeover protections;\n\u2022\nprovide for our classified Board of Directors, which divides our Board of Directors into three classes, with members of each class serving staggered three-year terms, which prevents stockholders from electing an entirely new Board of Directors at an annual meeting;\n\u2022\nlimit the ability of stockholders to remove directors;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholders from calling special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders; and\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election as directors or to bring other business before an annual meeting of our stockholders.\nThese provisions may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common and preferred stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common and preferred stock if the provisions are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.\nOur second amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us. Our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed to us or our stockholders by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising under the DGCL or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. By becoming a stockholder in our company, you will be deemed to have notice of and have consented to the provisions of our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation related to choice of forum. The choice of forum provision in our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - (continued)\nRisks Related to Healthcare Regulation\nIf we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations. The healthcare sector is heavily regulated, and we are required to comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations at the federal, state and local government levels relating to among other things:\n\u2022\nbilling and coding for services, including documentation of care, appropriate treatment of overpayments and credit balances, and the submission of false statements or claims;\n\u2022\nrelationships and arrangements with physicians, hospitals, vendors and other referral sources and referral recipients, including self-referral restrictions, prohibitions on kickbacks and other non-permitted forms of remuneration and prohibitions on the payment of inducements to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries in order to influence their selection of a provider;\n\u2022\nlicensure, certification, enrollment in government programs and CON approval, including requirements affecting the operation, establishment and addition of services and facilities;\n\u2022\nthe necessity, appropriateness, and adequacy of medical care, equipment, and personnel and conditions of coverage and payment for services;\n\u2022\nquality of care and data reporting;\n\u2022\nownership of surgery centers;\n\u2022\noperating policies and procedures;\n\u2022\nqualifications, training and supervision of medical and support personnel;\n\u2022\nfee-splitting and the corporate practice of medicine;\n\u2022\nscreening, stabilization and transfer of individuals who have emergency medical conditions;\n\u2022\nworkplace health and safety;\n\u2022\ndebt collection practices;\n\u2022\nanti-competitive conduct;\n\u2022\nconfidentiality, maintenance, data breach, identity theft and security issues associated with health-related and other personal information and medical records; and\n\u2022\nenvironmental protection.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil or criminal penalties, including fines, damages, recoupment of overpayments, loss of licenses needed to operate, loss of enrollment and approvals necessary to participate in Medicare, Medicaid and other government and third-party healthcare programs, and exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other government healthcare programs. Investors, officers and managing employees associated with entities found to have committed healthcare fraud may also be excluded from participation in government healthcare programs. Enforcement officials have numerous mechanisms to combat fraud and abuse. For example, they may bring civil actions under the Civil Monetary Penalty Law, which has a lower burden of proof than criminal statutes. Civil monetary penalties increased significantly in 2016 and, beginning in 2017, the penalty amounts will be adjusted annually based on updates to the consumer price index. Further, failure to bill properly for services or return overpayments and violations of other statutes, such as the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or the federal Stark Law, may be the basis for actions under the FCA or similar state laws.\nMany of these laws and regulations are complex, broad in scope and have few or narrowly structured exceptions and safe harbors. Further, these laws and regulations are subject to ongoing interpretation by regulatory agencies and courts. New interpretations of existing requirements, new laws or regulations or the enforcement of existing or new laws and regulations could subject our current practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or require us to make changes in our operations, facilities, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure programs or operating expenses to comply with evolving requirements. Any enforcement action against us, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. To avoid sanctions and end expensive enforcement actions, we may be required to enter into settlement agreements with the government. Typically, such settlement agreements require substantial payments to the government in exchange for the government to release its claims and may also require us to enter into a corporate integrity agreement that imposes extensive ongoing compliance obligations.\nWe cannot assure you that current or future legislative initiatives, government regulation or judicial or regulatory interpretations thereof will not have a material adverse effect on us. We cannot assure you that a review of our business by judicial, regulatory or accreditation authorities will not subject us to fines or penalties, require us to expend significant amounts, reduce the demand for our services or otherwise adversely affect our operations.\nOur relationships with referral sources and recipients, including healthcare providers, facilities and patients, are subject to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and similar state laws. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits healthcare providers and others from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying, directly or indirectly, any remuneration in return for, or to\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - (continued)\ninduce, referrals or orders for services or items covered by a federal healthcare program. Many of the states in which we operate also have adopted laws, similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, that prohibit payments to physicians in exchange for referrals, some of which apply regardless of the source of payment for care. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute and similar state laws are broad in scope and many of their provisions have not been uniformly or definitively interpreted by case law or regulations. Courts have found a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute if just one purpose of the remuneration is to generate referrals, even if there are other lawful purposes. Furthermore, knowledge of the law or intent to violate the law is not required to establish a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute.\nCongress and HHS have established narrow exceptions and safe harbor provisions that outline practices deemed protected from prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Many state laws restricting referrals do not contain exceptions or safe harbor provisions. While we endeavor to comply with applicable exceptions and safe harbors, certain of our current arrangements, including the ownership structures of our surgery centers, do not satisfy all of the requirements of a safe harbor. Failure to qualify for an exception or safe harbor does not mean the arrangement necessarily violates the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, but may subject the arrangement to greater scrutiny. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and similar state laws may result in substantial civil or criminal penalties, exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs and loss of licensure, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nLike other ambulance companies, we have provided discounts to our healthcare facility customers (nursing homes and hospitals) in certain circumstances. We have attempted to comply with applicable law when such discounts are provided. However, the government alleged that certain of our hospital and nursing home contracts in effect in Texas prior to 2002 contained discounts in violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, and in 2006 we entered into a settlement with the government regarding these allegations. The settlement included a CIA. The term of that CIA has expired, we have filed a final report with the OIG and this CIA was released in February 2012.\nWe are required to comply with laws governing the transmission, security and privacy of health information. The HIPAA administrative simplification provisions require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for healthcare claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically. In addition, as required by HIPAA, HHS has issued privacy and security regulations that extensively regulate the use and disclosure of protected health information or \u201cPHI\u201d and require covered entities, including healthcare providers and health plans, and vendors known as \u201cbusiness associates\u201d to implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the security of PHI. Covered entities must report breaches of unsecured PHI without unreasonable delay to affected individuals, HHS and, in the case of larger breaches, the media. The privacy, security and breach notification regulations have imposed, and will continue to impose, significant compliance costs on our operations.\nViolations of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations may result in criminal penalties and in civil penalties of up to $55,910 per violation up to a maximum of $1,677,299 in a calendar year for violations of the same requirement. A covered entity may be subject to penalties as a result of a business associate violating HIPAA, if the business associate is found to be an agent of the covered entity. The Department is required to perform compliance audits, and state attorneys general may enforce the HIPAA privacy and security regulations in response to violations that threaten the privacy of state residents.\nThere are numerous other laws and legislative and regulatory initiatives at the federal and state levels addressing privacy and security concerns. These laws vary and may impose additional obligations or penalties. For example, various state laws and regulations may require us to notify affected individuals in the event of a data breach involving individually identifiable information (even if no health-related information is involved). In addition, the FTC uses its consumer protection authority to initiate enforcement actions in response to data breaches. To the extent we fail to comply with one or more federal and/or state privacy and security requirements or if we are found to be responsible for the non-compliance of our vendors, we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties, as well as third-party claims which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are unable to predict the impact of the Health Reform Law, as currently structured. Healthcare is subject to changing political, regulatory and other influences, which have resulted, and may continue to result, in reform initiatives that significantly impact healthcare providers. In particular, the Health Reform Law, as currently structured, expands coverage of uninsured individuals through the expansion of public programs and private sector health insurance reforms, increases coverage of certain preventive services, including colonoscopies, reduces Medicare reimbursement to ASCs and hospitals, and promotes efforts intended to transform Medicare from a passive volume-based payment system to an active purchaser of quality goods and services. We believe the Health Reform Law has resulted in an increased volume for certain procedures and in patients seeking care from us, but other provisions have reduced payments to ASCs and may indirectly impact payments received by our physician services business. In addition, ACOs, other coordinated care models and other efforts to promote value-based spending in Medicare and other programs may increase competition for patients and negatively impact our surgery centers and medical practices.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - (continued)\nOur business may be adversely impacted if the Health Reform Law is repealed in its entirety or if provisions beneficial to our operations are repealed or significantly modified as a result of the 2016 federal elections. The 2016 federal elections increased the likelihood of repeal or replacement of, or the enactment of significant changes to, the Health Reform Law; are likely to impact how the executive branch implements the law; and may impact how the federal government responds to lawsuits challenging the Health Reform Law. The President and certain members of Congress have indicated their intent to significantly change existing healthcare laws, including significantly modifying or repealing the Health Reform Law. We estimate that if the Health Reform Law had been repealed effective January 1, 2017, our annualized net income before income taxes for 2017 would be adversely impacted by approximately $70.0 million to $80.0 million; however, because of the many variables and assumptions involved in preparing this estimate, and the considerable uncertainty regarding whether, when and how the law will be changed, what alternative provisions, if any, may be enacted, or what other actions may be taken, the actual impact of any such change may differ materially from our estimate. Any government efforts related to health reform may have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow, capital resources and liquidity. Moreover, the general uncertainty of health reform efforts, particularly if Congress elects to repeal provisions of the Health Reform Law but delays the implementation of repeal or fails to enact replacement provisions at the time of repeal, may have a material and adverse impact our business, strategies, prospects, operating results or financial condition.\nWe have been and could become the subject of federal and state investigations and compliance reviews. Health care companies are subject to a high level of scrutiny by various governmental agencies and their agents. Both federal and state government agencies have heightened and coordinated civil and criminal enforcement efforts as part of numerous ongoing investigations of healthcare companies, as well as their executives and managers. These investigations relate to a wide variety of topics, including referral and billing practices. Further, the federal FCA permits private parties to bring qui tam or \u201cwhistleblower\u201d lawsuits against companies. Some states have adopted similar state whistleblower and false claims provisions.\nFrom time to time, the OIG and the Department of Justice have established national enforcement initiatives that focus on specific billing practices or other suspected areas of abuse. Some of our activities could become the subject of governmental investigations or inquiries. Our significant Medicare billings and joint venture arrangements involving physician investors may increase our exposure. We have, in past years, been the subject of investigations regarding its contracting processes and billing practices, ultimately resulting in two settlement agreements and CIAs. The operations of Rural/Metro are currently subject to a CIA, which was established in connection with documentation and billing allegations prior to its acquisition by Envision. In addition, our executives and managers, some of whom have worked at other healthcare companies that are or may become the subject of federal and state investigations and private litigation, could be included in governmental investigations or named as defendants in private litigation.\nGovernmental agencies and their agents conduct audits of health care providers, and private payers may conduct similar audits, investigations and monitoring activities. From time to time, we receive repayment demands from third-party payors based on allegations that our services were not medically necessary, were billed at an improper level, or otherwise violated applicable billing requirements. Our failure to comply with rules related to billing could result in, among other penalties, nonpayment for services rendered or refunds of amounts previously paid for such services. An investigation or audit of us, our executives or our managers could result in significant expense to us, adverse publicity, and divert management\u2019s attention from our business, regardless of the outcome, and could result in significant penalties. Depending on nature of the conduct and whether the underlying conduct under investigation or audit could be considered systemic, the resolution of any review could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nTreatment methodologies and governmental or commercial health insurance controls designed to reduce spending on healthcare procedures may reduce our revenue and profitability. Controls imposed by Medicare and Medicaid, employer-sponsored healthcare plans and commercial health insurance payors designed to reduce the volume and costs of services provided to patients, in some instances referred to as \u201cutilization review,\u201d could adversely affect our facilities and medical practices. Although we are unable to predict the effect these changes will have on our operations, significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees may reduce our revenue and profitability. Additionally, trends in treatment protocols and commercial health insurance plan design, such as plans that shift increased costs and accountability for care to patients, could favor lower intensity and lower cost treatment methodologies, each of which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to timely enroll our physician services segment providers in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, or if we do not fully comply with requirements to provide notice or reapply to various licensure or other certification authorities in connection with changes in our ownership structure or operations, our collections and revenues may be harmed. We are required to enroll our physician services segment providers who are not otherwise already enrolled with Medicare and Medicaid in order to bill these programs for the physician services they provide. With respect to Medicare, providers can retrospectively bill Medicare for services provided 30 days prior to the effective date of the enrollment. In addition, the enrollment rules provide that the effective date of the\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - (continued)\nenrollment will be the later of the date on which the enrollment application was filed and approved by the Medicare contractor, or the date on which the provider began providing services. If we are unable to properly enroll physicians and other applicable healthcare professionals within the 30 days after the provider begins providing services, we will be precluded from billing Medicare for any services which were provided to a Medicare beneficiary more than 30 days prior to the effective date of the enrollment. With respect to Medicaid, new enrollment rules and whether a state will allow providers to retrospectively bill Medicaid for services provided prior to submitting an enrollment application varies by state. Failure to timely enroll providers could reduce our physician services segment net revenue and have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations of our physician services segment.\nThe Health Reform Law, as currently structured, added additional enrollment requirements for Medicare and Medicaid, which have been further enhanced through implementing regulations and increased enforcement scrutiny. Every enrolled provider must revalidate its enrollment at regular intervals and must update the Medicare contractors and many state Medicaid programs with significant changes on a timely basis. If we fail to provide sufficient documentation as required to maintain our enrollment, Medicare and Medicaid could deny continued future enrollment or revoke our enrollment and billing privileges.\nThe requirements for enrollment, licensure, certification, and accreditation may include notification or approval in the event of a transfer or change of ownership or certain other changes. Other agencies or payors with which we have contracts may have similar requirements, and some of these processes may be complex. Failure to provide required notifications or obtain necessary approvals may result in the delay or inability to complete an acquisition or transfer, loss of licensure, lapses in reimbursement, or other penalties. While we make reasonable efforts to substantially comply with these requirements, we cannot assure you that the agencies that administer these programs or have awarded us contracts will not find that we have failed to comply in some material respects. A finding of non-compliance and any resulting payment delays, refund demands or other sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nLaws and regulations impacting our arrangements with healthcare professionals and entities may cause us to restructure such arrangements, incur additional costs, lose contracts or suffer reductions under existing contracts. A number of laws bear on our relationships with healthcare professionals and entities. For example, corporate practice of medicine laws generally prohibit the practice of medicine by lay entities or persons in order to prevent interference with independent medical judgment. These laws, which vary by state, may also prevent the sharing of professional services income with non-professional or business interests.\nSome of our contracts with healthcare professionals and entities include provisions preventing these individuals and entities from competing with us both during and after the term of our contract with them. The laws governing non-compete agreements and other forms of restrictive covenants vary from state to state. Some jurisdictions prohibit us from using non-compete covenants with our professional staff, while others are reluctant to strictly enforce non-compete agreements and restrictive covenants, especially when applied to healthcare providers. Additionally, certain facilities have the right to employ or engage our providers after the termination or expiration of our contract with those facilities, which limits our ability to enforce our non-compete provisions with regard to those providers.\nThere is a risk that authorities in some jurisdictions may take the position, or private litigants may allege, that our contractual relationships violate applicable laws. There can be no assurance that our non-compete agreements related to healthcare professionals and entities will not be successfully challenged as unenforceable in certain states. In such event, we would be unable to prevent the physicians or other parties to these agreements from competing with us, potentially resulting in the loss of some of our contracts or other business. Any adverse interpretations or changes could force us to restructure our relationships with physicians, other clinical employees, professional corporations or our hospital customers, or to restructure our operations. This could cause our operating costs to increase significantly. A restructuring could also result in a loss of contracts or a reduction in revenue under existing contracts.", "PERMNO": 85676, "SIC": 8011, "TIC": "EVHC"}
