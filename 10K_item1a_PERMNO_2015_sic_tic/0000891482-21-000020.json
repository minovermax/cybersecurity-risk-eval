Risk Factors.\nAn investment in our securities is subject to risks inherent to our business. We have described below what we currently believe to be the material risks and uncertainties in our business. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe also face other risks and uncertainties beyond what is described below. This Annual Report on Form 10-K is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the value of securities, including our common stock, could decline significantly. You could lose all or part of your investment.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nThe following is a summary of the risk factors discussed in \u201cItem 1A - Risk Factors\u201d in Part I of this Form 10-K. This summary should be read in conjunction with those Risk Factors and should not be relied upon as an exhaustive summary of the material risks facing our business.\nRisks Related to our Business and Operations\n\u25cf The outbreak of COVID-19 (coronavirus), which has significantly impacted the global economy, including the gaming industry.\n\u25cf A prolonged closure of our casinos would negatively impact our ability to service our debt.\n\u25cf Significant competition from other gaming and entertainment operations.\n\u25cf Revenue declines if discretionary consumer spending drops due to an economic downturn.\n\u25cf The inability of our contracted sports betting parties, through the use of our permitted website \u201cskins,\u201d to compete effectively, their inability and/or unwillingness to sustain sports betting operations should they experience an extended period of unprofitability, and our inability to replace existing partners or vendors on similar terms as our existing revenue guarantees.\n\u25cf Marine transportation is inherently risky, and insurance may be insufficient to cover losses that may occur to our assets or result from our ferry boat operations.\n\u25cf We derive our revenues and operating income from our casino resort properties located in Mississippi, Colorado, Indiana and Nevada, and are especially subject to certain risks, including economic and competitive risks, associated with the conditions in those areas and in the states from which we draw patrons.\n\u25cf If the lessor of Grand Lodge Casino exercises its buyout rights or if we default on this or on certain other leases, the applicable lessors could terminate the affected leases and we could lose possession of the affected casino.\n\u25cf Adverse weather conditions, road construction, gasoline shortages and other factors affecting our facilities and the areas in which we operate could make it more difficult for potential customers to travel to our properties and deter customers from visiting our properties.\n\u25cf The occurrence of natural disasters, such as hurricanes, pandemics, epidemics, widespread health emergencies, or outbreaks of infectious diseases such as the coronavirus pandemic, or other catastrophic events, including war, terrorism and gun violence.\n\u25cf Several of our properties, including Silver Slipper, Bronco Billy\u2019s and Rising Star, are accessed by our customers via routes that have few alternatives.\n\u25cf We may incur property and other losses that are not adequately covered by insurance.\n\u25cf We depend on our key personnel.\n\u25cf Higher wage and benefit costs, including a potential increase in the federal minimum wage.\n\u25cf Rising operating costs at our gaming properties.\n\u25cf We face the risk of fraud and cheating.\n\u25cf Win rates for our gaming operations depend on a variety of factors, some beyond our control.\n\u25cf The concentration and evolution of the slot machine manufacturing industry could impose additional costs on us.\n\u25cf Our business may be adversely affected by legislation prohibiting tobacco smoking.\n\u25cf We are subject to risks related to corporate social responsibility and reputation.\nRisks Related to Development and Growth Opportunities\n\u25cf We are often involved in one or more construction and development projects, including the new Cripple Creek casino hotel, and many factors could prevent us from completing them as planned.\n\u25cf The construction costs for the new Cripple Creek casino hotel may exceed budgeted amounts plus contingencies, which may result in insufficient funds to complete the project.\n\u25cf There is no assurance that new Cripple Creek casino hotel will not be subject to additional regulatory restrictions, delays, or challenges.\n\u25cf There is no assurance that the new Cripple Creek casino hotel will be successful.\n\u25cf Failure to comply with the terms of our disbursement agreement could limit our access to funds.\n\u25cf We face a number of challenges prior to opening new or upgraded facilities.\n\u25cf We may face disruption and other difficulties in integrating and managing facilities we have recently developed or acquired, or may develop or acquire in the future.\n\u25cf The construction of the new Cripple Creek casino hotel may inconvenience customers and disrupt business activity at the adjoining Bronco Billy\u2019s casino.\n\u25cf Additional growth projects or potential enhancements at our properties may require us to raise additional capital.\n\u25cf The casino, hotel and resort industry is capital intensive and we may not be able to finance expansion and renovation projects, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage.\n\u25cf Our ability to receive regulatory approvals required to complete certain acquisitions, mergers, joint ventures, and other developments, as well as other potential delays in completing certain transactions.\n\u25cf Failure to obtain necessary government approvals in a timely manner, or at all.\n\u25cf Insufficient or lower-than-expected results generated from our new developments and acquired properties.\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness\n\u25cf Our significant indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations.\n\u25cf Restrictive covenants and limitations in our debt facilities that could significantly affect our ability to borrow additional funds and/or operate our business and could lead to events of default if we do not comply with the covenants.\n\u25cf Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to service our indebtedness and fund our operating expenses, working capital needs and capital expenditures.\n\u25cf We depend on our subsidiaries for certain dividends, distributions and repayment of our indebtedness.\n\u25cf Our ability to obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms may be limited.\n\u25cf The obligations under the 2028 Notes are collateralized by a security interest in substantially all of our assets, so if we default on those obligations, the holders of the 2028 Notes could foreclose on our assets.\n\u25cf Our loans under the CARES Act may be subject to regulatory review.\n\u25cf We and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt.\nRisks Related to our Legal and Regulatory Environment\n\u25cf We face extensive regulation from gaming and other regulatory authorities and the cost of compliance or failure to comply with such regulations may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\u25cf Changes in legislation and regulation of our business.\n\u25cf Stockholders may be required to dispose of their shares of our common stock if they are found unsuitable by gaming authorities.\n\u25cf We are subject to environmental laws and potential exposure to environmental liabilities.\n\u25cf We are subject to litigation which, if adversely determined, could cause us to incur substantial losses.\n\u25cf Our ferry boat service is highly regulated, which can adversely affect our operations.\nRisks Related to Technology\n\u25cf Our gaming operations rely heavily on technology services and an uninterrupted supply of electrical power, and if we experience damage or service interruptions, we may have to cease some or all of our operations.\n\u25cf Our information technology and other systems are subject to cyber-security risk, misappropriation of customer information and other breaches of information security.\nGeneral Risks\n\u25cf Our ability to utilize our net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\n\u25cf The market price for our common stock may be volatile, and investors may not be able to sell our stock at a favorable price or at all.\n\u25cf The exercise of outstanding options to purchase common stock may result in substantial dilution and may depress the trading price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to our Business and Operations\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 (coronavirus) has significantly impacted the global economy, including the gaming industry, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nThe coronavirus pandemic and the efforts to contain it have significantly impacted the global economy, including the gaming industry in the United States and abroad. The ongoing outbreak has resulted in extended shutdowns of non-essential businesses around the world, including our own casinos for approximately three months, beginning in March 2020. While our casinos have reopened from such shutdowns, we currently operate under capacity restrictions, including limitations on the number of guests permitted in our buildings, the number of slot machines and table games that we are permitted to operate, the maximum occupancy in our restaurants, and the hours during which we are permitted to serve alcoholic beverages. We continue to have restrictions on concerts or special events that we have historically used to bring customers to our properties. Furthermore, governments have discouraged all non-essential movement and/or ordered social distancing and sheltering-in-place in an effort to help control the transmission of the coronavirus.\nThe current circumstances are dynamic and the impacts of the coronavirus on our business operations, including the duration and impact on overall customer demand, is ongoing and uncertain. For example, since our casinos have been allowed to reopen, some guests have chosen to not travel or visit our properties for health concerns, which has led to lower occupancy and lower room rates at our hotels. Additional closures or disruptions in our casino business would likely have a negative impact on our business and operating results. As the coronavirus continues to spread in the United States, we may elect on a voluntary basis to again close certain of our properties or portions thereof, or governmental officials may order additional closures or impose further restrictions on travel or on our operations, including the number of people allowed in our casino or perhaps sitting at any specific table game or bank of slot machines. Even as vaccines are becoming more readily available, the pandemic may still have the potential to have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nAny of these events could result in significant disruptions to our operations and a drop in demand for our hotel-casino properties and could have a material adverse effect on us. Our operations could also be negatively affected if employees elect to stay home or are quarantined as the result of exposure to the virus. In addition, our reliance on third-party suppliers for food and other services, as well as construction materials and construction labor, exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these and similar goods and services. Such operational disruptions could increase our costs, further decrease our operating efficiencies and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Furthermore, any reductions in marketing or labor expenses as a result of limited operations may not continue following the end of the COVID-19 pandemic. The extent to which the coronavirus impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, including the duration and impact on overall customer demand, new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus, and the actions to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact, among others.\nA prolonged closure of our casinos would negatively impact our ability to service our debt.\nOur casinos are our primary sources of income and operating cash flows which we rely upon to remain in compliance with debt covenants under any indebtedness we may incur and meet our obligations when due. As noted above, due to the coronavirus pandemic, our operations at our casinos and hotels are currently operating at reduced capacity, after approximately three months of temporary closures approximately a year ago, and there is uncertainty as to if additional closures will occur. Because we operate in several different jurisdictions, we are subject to different legal and market conditions in order to remain open. Although we believe we have sufficient resources to fund our currently-reduced operations for a period of time, we have no control over and cannot predict the length of current operating restrictions or future closures of our casinos and hotels due to the pandemic. If we are unable to generate revenues from our casinos due to new and prolonged periods of closure or experience significant declines in business volumes, this would negatively impact our ability to meet our payment obligations. In\nsuch an event, we could seek to amend our debt agreements, though there is no certainty that we would be successful in such efforts. Additionally, we could seek additional liquidity through the issuance of new debt or equity, or through the sale of certain assets. Our ability to obtain additional financing would depend in part on factors outside of our control. If there is a prolonged closure of our casinos and hotels, or we are unable to obtain additional capital, we may not be able to pay our obligations as they become due and could risk default under our indebtedness, including the 2028 Notes, upon which the amounts outstanding could be accelerated.\nWe face significant competition from other gaming and entertainment operations.\nThe gaming industry is characterized by an increasingly high degree of competition among a large number of participants, including casinos, racetrack casinos, sports betting, video lottery, poker machines not located in casinos, Native American gaming, social gaming and other forms of gaming. Furthermore, competition from Internet lotteries, sweepstakes, and other Internet gaming services, which allow customers to wager on a wide variety of sporting events and play casino games from home or in non-casino settings, including those offered by companies affiliated with us, could divert customers from our properties and thus materially and adversely affect our business. Additionally, there are often proposals to further legalize Internet gaming in a number of states and at the federal level. Several states, including Nevada, New Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania, have enacted legislation authorizing intrastate Internet gaming and Internet gaming operations have begun in these states. Expansion of Internet gaming in other jurisdictions could further compete with our traditional operations, which could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nIn a broader sense, our gaming operations face competition from all manner of leisure and entertainment activities, including other non-gaming resorts and vacation destinations, shopping, athletic events, television and movies, concerts, and travel. Legalized gaming is currently permitted in various forms throughout the U.S., in several Canadian provinces and on various lands taken into trust for the benefit of certain Native Americans in the U.S. and Canada. New jurisdictions may legalize gaming and established gaming jurisdictions could award additional gaming licenses or permit the expansion or relocation of existing gaming operations. New, relocated or expanded operations by other persons could increase competition for our gaming operations and could have a material adverse impact on us. Gaming competition is intense in most of the markets where we operate. In most markets, we compete directly with other casino facilities operating in the immediate and surrounding market areas. In some markets, we face competition from nearby markets in addition to direct competition within our market areas. As competing properties and new markets are opened, our operating results may be negatively impacted. In addition, some of our direct competitors in certain markets may have superior facilities and/or operating conditions. We expect each existing or future market in which we participate to be highly competitive. The competitive position of each of our casino properties is discussed in \u201cItem 1. Business - Competition\u201d.\nWe may face revenue declines if discretionary consumer spending drops due to an economic downturn.\nOur revenues are highly dependent upon the volume and spending levels of customers at our properties and, as such, our business has been in the past, and could be in the future, adversely impacted by economic downturns. Decreases in discretionary consumer spending brought about by weakened general economic conditions such as, but not limited to, lackluster recoveries from recessions, pandemics, epidemics, widespread health emergencies, or outbreaks of infectious diseases such as the coronavirus, high unemployment levels, higher income taxes, low levels of consumer confidence, weakness in the housing market, cultural and demographic changes, and increased stock market volatility may negatively impact our revenues and operating cash flow. For example, the coronavirus is expected to have indeterminable adverse effects on the global economy, including the United States, such as an economic slowdown and it is possible that it could cause a global recession. This could lead to a reduction in discretionary spending by our guests on entertainment and leisure activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, cash flow and results of operations. Furthermore, during periods of economic contraction, our revenues may decrease while many of our costs remain fixed and some costs may increase, resulting in decreased earnings.\nWe cannot assure you that any of our contracted sports betting parties, through the use of our permitted website \u201cskins,\u201d will be able to compete effectively, that our contracted sports parties will have the ability and/or willingness to sustain sports betting operations should they experience an extended period of unprofitability, or that we will have the ability to replace existing partners or vendors on similar terms as our existing revenue guarantees.\nOur contracted sports betting parties, through the use of our permitted website \u201cskins,\u201d compete in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive market against an increasing number of competitors. The success of their sports betting operations is dependent on a number of factors that are beyond our and their control, including the ultimate tax rates and license fees charged by jurisdictions across the United States; their ability to gain market share in a newly developing market; the timeliness and the technological and popular viability of their products; their ability to compete with new entrants in the market; changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences; and the availability and popularity of other forms of entertainment. While our current agreements with our contracted sports betting parties provide us with contractual minimums for revenue upon their launch of operations, we cannot assure you that any of our contracted sports parties will be able to compete effectively or that they will have the ability or willingness to sustain sports betting operations for an extended period of unprofitability. Should any of our contracted sports betting parties cease operations, whether due to unprofitability or for other reasons, there can be no assurance that we will be able to replace them on similar terms as our existing agreements.\nMarine transportation is inherently risky, and insurance may be insufficient to cover losses that may occur to our assets or result from our ferry boat operations.\nThe operation of our vessel is subject to various inherent risks, including:\n\u25cf catastrophic marine disasters and accidents;\n\u25cf adverse weather conditions or natural disasters;\n\u25cf mechanical failure or equipment damage;\n\u25cf hazardous substance spills; and\n\u25cf navigation and human errors.\nThe occurrence of any of these events may result in, among other things, damage to or loss of our vessel, damage to other vessels and the environment, loss of revenues, short-term or long-term interruption of ferry boat service, termination of our vessel charter or other contracts, fines, penalties or other restrictions on conducting business, damage to our reputation and customer relationships, and death or injury to personnel and passengers. Such occurrences may also result in a significant increase in our operating costs or liability to third parties.\nWe derive our revenues and operating income from our casino resort properties located in Mississippi, Colorado, Indiana and Nevada, and are especially subject to certain risks, including economic and competitive risks, associated with the conditions in those areas and in the states from which we draw patrons.\nBecause we derive our revenues and operating income from properties concentrated in four states, we are subject to greater risks from regional conditions than a gaming company with operating properties in a greater number of different geographic regions. A decrease in revenues from, or an increase in costs for, one of these locations is likely to have a proportionally greater impact on our business and operations than it would for a gaming company with more geographically diverse operating properties. Risks from regional conditions include the following:\n\u25cf regional economic conditions;\n\u25cf regional competitive conditions, including legalization or expansion of gaming in Mississippi, Colorado, Indiana, Nevada, or in neighboring states;\n\u25cf allowance of new types of gaming, such as the introduction of live table games at Indiana racinos or Internet gaming;\n\u25cf reduced land or air travel due to increasing fuel costs or transportation disruptions; and,\n\u25cf increase in our vulnerability to economic downturns and competitive pressures in the markets in which we operate.\nSome of our casino resort operations are located on leased property. If the lessor of the Grand Lodge Casino exercises its buyout rights or if we default on this or certain of our other leases, the applicable lessors could terminate the affected leases and we could lose possession of the affected casino.\nWe lease certain parcels of land at our Silver Slipper Casino and Hotel in Mississippi, certain land and buildings at Bronco Billy\u2019s Hotel and Casino in Colorado (much of which is to be utilized for the new Cripple Creek casino hotel) and one of the two hotels at our Rising Star Casino Resort in Indiana. We also lease casino space at our Grand Lodge Casino in Nevada. As a lessee, we have the right to use the leased land, hotel or space, as applicable; however, we do not hold fee ownership. Accordingly, unless we have a purchase option and exercise such option, we will have no interest in the improvements thereon at the expiration of the leases. We have such purchase options on the leased property at the Silver Slipper, Bronco Billy\u2019s and for the leased hotel at Rising Star, but it is either currently more advantageous for us to continue to lease rather than exercise the buyout option, or we have certain restrictions which only allow us to exercise the purchase option during certain future time periods. Under certain circumstances and at the expirations of the underlying leases, we might be forced to exercise our buyout options in order to continue to operate those properties. There is no certainty that the funds could be raised at that time at a reasonable cost, or at all, to exercise some or all of the buyout options. The operating lease at the Grand Lodge Casino, which is set to expire on August 31, 2023, includes certain lessor buyout rights based upon a multiple of EBITDA that, if exercised, could result in the lessor purchasing our leasehold interest and the operating assets on terms that may be less than fair market value or financially unfavorable to us. Since we do not completely control the land, buildings, hotel and space underlying our leased properties, a lessor could take certain actions to disrupt our rights under the long-term leases which are beyond our control. If the entity owning any leased land, buildings, hotel or space chose to disrupt our use either permanently or for a significant period of time, then the value of our assets could be impaired and our business and operations could be adversely affected. If we were to default on the lease, the lessor could terminate the affected lease and we could lose possession of the affected land, buildings, hotel or space and any improvements thereon. The loss of the lease through exercise of buyout rights or through termination upon default could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations as we would then be unable to operate all or portions of the affected facilities, which, in turn, may result in a default under our debt agreements.\nAdverse weather conditions, road construction, gasoline shortages and other factors affecting our facilities and the areas in which we operate could make it more difficult for potential customers to travel to our properties and deter customers from visiting our properties.\nOur continued success depends upon our ability to draw customers from each of the geographic markets in which we operate. Adverse weather conditions or road construction can deter our customers from traveling to our facilities or make it difficult for them to frequent our properties. In recent years, there were severe cold temperatures that we believe adversely affected our Indiana and Mississippi properties\u2019 financial performance and historically low snow levels in the Lake Tahoe region adversely affected visitation and financial performance at Grand Lodge. Bronco Billy\u2019s in recent years was adversely affected by nearby forest fires, as well as the subsequent flooding of its access roads due to lack of vegetation (from the forest fires) on hills above such roads. Moreover, gasoline shortages or fuel price increases could make it more difficult for potential customers to travel to our properties and deter customers from visiting. Our dockside gaming facility in Indiana, as well as any additional riverboat or dockside casino properties that might be developed or acquired, are also subject to risks, in addition to those associated with land-based casinos, which could disrupt our operations. Although our Indiana casino vessel does not leave its moorings in normal operations, there are risks associated with the movement or mooring of vessels on waterways, including risks of casualty due to river turbulence, flooding, collisions with other vessels and severe weather conditions. Our ferry boat that we operate at Rising Star has similar risks as our Indiana casino vessel, as well as additional risks related to ferry boat operations discussed above.\nOur results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by the occurrence of natural disasters, such as hurricanes, pandemics, epidemics, widespread health emergencies, or outbreaks of infectious diseases such as the coronavirus pandemic, or other catastrophic events, including war, terrorism and gun violence.\nNatural disasters, such as major hurricanes, tornadoes, typhoons, floods, fires and earthquakes, could adversely affect our business and operating results. Hurricanes are common in the area in which our Mississippi property is located, and the severity of such natural disasters is unpredictable. In October 2020, Hurricane Zeta caused the temporary closure of the Silver Slipper and caused approximately $5 million of damage, most of which was covered by insurance. In 2005, Hurricanes Katrina\nand Rita caused significant damage in the Gulf Coast region. Additionally, our Indiana property is at risk of flooding due to its proximity to the Ohio River.\nIf a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease, such as the recent coronavirus pandemic, occurs in the United States or on a global scale, our business may be adversely affected. As described elsewhere in these Risk Factors, such events may result in closures of our properties, a period of business disruption, and/or in reduced operations, any of which could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCatastrophic events, such as terrorist and war activities in the United States and elsewhere, when they occur, have had a negative effect on travel and leisure expenditures, including lodging, gaming and tourism. Gun violence has also occurred at casinos, including a mass shooting at a casino in Las Vegas in 2017. We cannot accurately predict the extent to which such events may affect us, directly or indirectly, in the future. There also can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain or choose to purchase any insurance coverage with respect to occurrences of terrorist and violent acts and any losses that could result from these acts. If there is a prolonged disruption at our properties due to natural disasters, terrorist attacks or other catastrophic events, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nSeveral of our properties, including Silver Slipper, Bronco Billy\u2019s and Rising Star, are accessed by our customers via routes that have few alternatives.\nThe Silver Slipper is located at the end of a dead-end road, with no other access. Bronco Billy\u2019s is accessed by most guests via a mountain pass; if that pass is closed for any reason, the alternative is longer. Rising Star\u2019s primary access from Cincinnati is via a road alongside the Ohio River; if this road were to close, the alternative routes involve more winding roads through the rolling hills inland from the river or a ferry boat. If access to any of these roads is blocked for any significant period, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially affected.\nWe may incur property and other losses that are not adequately covered by insurance, including adequate levels of Weather Catastrophe Occurrence/Named Windstorm, Flood and Earthquake insurance coverage for our properties.\nAlthough we maintain insurance that our management believes is customary and appropriate for our business, there can be no assurance that insurance will be available at reasonable costs in any given year or adequate to cover all losses and damage to which our business or our assets might be subjected. The lack of adequate insurance for certain types or levels of risk could expose us to significant losses in the event that a catastrophe occurred for which we are uninsured or under-insured. Any losses we incur that are not adequately covered by insurance may decrease our future operating income, require us to find replacements or repairs for destroyed property, and reduce the funds available for payments of our obligations. In addition, certain casualty events, such as labor strikes, nuclear events, acts of war, declines in visitation and loss of income due to fear of terrorism or other acts of violence, loss of electrical power due to catastrophic events, rolling blackouts or otherwise, deterioration or corrosion, insect or animal damage, pandemic-related shutdowns and pollution, may not be covered at all under our policies. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could, therefore, expose us to substantial uninsured losses.\nThere is no certainty that insurance companies will continue to offer insurance at acceptable rates, or at all, in hurricane-prone areas, including the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Some insurance companies may significantly limit the amount of coverage they will write in these markets and increase the premiums charged for this coverage. Additionally, uncertainty can occur as to the viability of certain insurance companies. While we believe that the insurance companies from which we have purchased insurance policies will remain solvent, there is no certainty that this will be the case.\nWe depend on our key personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on the services of our executive management team and other members of our senior management team. Our ability to attract and retain key personnel is affected by the competitiveness of our compensation packages and the other terms and conditions of employment, our continued ability to compete effectively against other gaming companies, and our growth prospects. The loss of the services of any members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nHigher wage and benefit costs could adversely affect our business.\nWhile the majority of our employees earn more than the minimum wage in their relative jurisdictions and many receive medical plan benefits from us, changes in federal and state minimum wage laws and other laws relating to employee benefits, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, have in the past, and could in the future, cause us to incur additional wage and benefits costs. Increased labor costs brought about by changes in either federal or state minimum wage laws, other regulations or prevailing market conditions have recently, and could in the future, further increase our expenses, which could have an adverse impact on our profitability, or decrease the number of employees we are able to employ, which could decrease customer service levels at our gaming facilities and therefore adversely impact revenues. For example, the state of Colorado increased its minimum wage to $11.10 in January 2019, $12.00 in January 2020 and again to $12.32 in January 2021. Thereafter it will be adjusted annually for cost-of-living increases, as measured by the Consumer Price Index used for Colorado. There is also the potential for an increase in the federal minimum wage, including a recent proposal to gradually increase it to $15.00.\nRising operating costs at our gaming properties could have a negative impact on our business.\nThe operating expenses associated with our gaming properties could increase due to, among other reasons, the following factors:\n\u25cf changes in federal, state or local tax or regulations, including state gaming regulations or gaming taxes, could impose additional restrictions or increase our operating costs;\n\u25cf aggressive marketing and promotional campaigns by our competitors for an extended period of time could force us to increase our expenditures for marketing and promotional campaigns in order to maintain our existing customer base or attract new customers;\n\u25cf as our properties age, we may need to increase our expenditures for repairs, maintenance, and to replace equipment necessary to operate our business in amounts greater than what we have spent historically;\n\u25cf our reliance on slot play revenues and any additional costs imposed on us from slot machine vendors;\n\u25cf availability and cost of the many products and services we provide our customers, including food, beverages, retail items, entertainment, hotel rooms, spa and golf;\n\u25cf availability and costs associated with insurance;\n\u25cf increases in costs of labor;\n\u25cf our properties use significant amounts of electricity, natural gas and other forms of energy, and energy price increases may adversely affect our cost structure;\n\u25cf our properties use significant amounts of water, and a water shortage may adversely affect our operations; and\n\u25cf at Grand Lodge, we rely on Hyatt Lake Tahoe to provide certain items at reasonable costs, including food, beverages, parking and rooms. Any change in its pricing or the availability of such items may affect our ability to compete.\nIf our operating expenses increase without any offsetting increase in our revenues, our results of operations would suffer.\nWe face the risk of fraud and cheating.\nOur gaming customers may attempt or commit fraud or cheat in order to increase winnings. Acts of fraud or cheating could involve the use of counterfeit chips or other tactics, possibly in collusion with our employees. Internal acts of cheating could also be conducted by employees directly or through collusion with dealers, surveillance staff, floor managers or other casino or gaming area staff. Failure to discover such acts or schemes in a timely manner could result in losses in our gaming operations. In addition, negative publicity related to such schemes could have an adverse effect on our reputation, potentially causing a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWin rates for our gaming operations depend on a variety of factors, some beyond our control.\nThe gaming industry is characterized by an element of chance. In addition to the element of chance, win rates are also affected by other factors, including players\u2019 skill and experience, the mix of games played, the financial resources of players, the spread of table limits, the volume of bets played and the amount of time played. Our gaming profits are mainly derived from the difference between our casino winnings and the casino winnings of our gaming customers. Since there is an inherent element of\nchance in the gaming industry, we do not have full control over our winnings or the winnings of our gaming customers. If our winnings do not exceed the winnings of our gaming customers by enough to cover our operating costs, we may record a loss from our gaming operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe concentration and evolution of the slot machine manufacturing industry could impose additional costs on us.\nA majority of our revenues are attributable to slot machines and related systems operated by us at our gaming facilities. It is important, for competitive reasons, that we offer popular and up-to-date slot machine games to our customers. A substantial majority of the slot machines sold in the U.S. in recent years were manufactured by only a few companies, and there has been recent consolidation activity within the gaming equipment sector. In recent years, slot machine manufacturers have frequently refused to sell slot machines featuring the most popular games, instead requiring participation lease arrangements. Participation slot machine leasing arrangements typically require the payment of a fixed daily rental or a percentage payment of coin-in or net win. Generally, a participation lease is more expensive over the long term than the cost to purchase a new machine. For competitive reasons, we may be forced to purchase new slot machines or enter into participation lease arrangements that are more expensive than our current costs associated with the continued operation of our existing slot machines. If the newer slot machines do not result in sufficient incremental revenues to offset the increased investment and participation lease costs, it could hurt our profitability.\nOur business may be adversely affected by legislation prohibiting tobacco smoking.\nLegislation in various forms to ban indoor tobacco smoking has been enacted or introduced in jurisdictions in which we operate. Except for our casino in Colorado, the gaming areas of our properties are not currently subject to tobacco restrictions. While gaming areas have generally been exempted from these restrictions, if additional restrictions on smoking are enacted in jurisdictions in which we operate, we could experience a decrease in gaming revenue. This is particularly the case if such restrictions are not applicable to all competitive facilities in that gaming market.\nWe are subject to risks related to corporate social responsibility and reputation.\nMany factors influence our reputation and the value of our brands, including the perception held by our customers, business partners, other key stakeholders and the communities in which we do business. Our business faces increasing scrutiny related to environmental, social and governance activities and risk of damage to our reputation and the value of our brands if we fail to act responsibly in a number of areas, such as diversity and inclusion, environmental stewardship, climate change, workplace conduct, human rights, philanthropy and support for local communities. Any harm to our reputation could impact employee engagement and retention and the willingness of customers and our partners to do business with us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Development and Growth Opportunities\nWe are engaged from time to time in one or more construction and development projects, including the new Cripple Creek casino hotel, and many factors could prevent us from completing them as planned.\nConstruction of major buildings has certain inherent risks, including the risks of fire, structural collapse, human error and electrical, mechanical and plumbing malfunction. In addition, projects entail additional risks related to structural heights and the required use of cranes. Our development and expansion projects are exposed to significant risks, including:\n\u25cf shortage of materials;\n\u25cf shortage of skilled labor or work stoppages;\n\u25cf unforeseen construction scheduling, engineering, excavation, environmental or geological problems;\n\u25cf increases in the cost of steel and other raw materials for construction, driven by U.S. tariffs on imports, demand, higher labor and construction costs and other factors, may cause price increases beyond those anticipated in the budgets for our development projects;\n\u25cf natural disasters, hurricanes, weather interference, changes in river levels, floods, fires, earthquakes, the impacts of pandemic such as coronavirus, or other casualty losses or delays;\n\u25cf unanticipated cost increases or delays in completing the project;\n\u25cf delays in obtaining, or inability to obtain or maintain, necessary license or permits;\n\u25cf lack of sufficient, or delays in the availability of, financing;\n\u25cf changes to plans or specifications;\n\u25cf performance by contractors and subcontractors;\n\u25cf disputes with contractors;\n\u25cf personal injuries to workers and other persons;\n\u25cf disruption of our operations caused by diversion of management\u2019s attention to new development projects and construction at our existing properties;\n\u25cf remediation of environmental contamination at some of our proposed construction sites, which may prove more difficult or expensive than anticipated in our construction budgets;\n\u25cf failure to obtain and maintain necessary gaming regulatory approvals and licenses, or failure to obtain such approvals and licenses on a timely basis;\n\u25cf requirements or government-established \u201cgoals\u201d concerning union labor or requiring that a portion of the project expenditures be through companies controlled by specific ethnic or gender groups, goals that may not be obtainable, or may only be obtainable at additional project cost; and\n\u25cf other unanticipated circumstances or cost increases.\nThe occurrence of any of the foregoing could increase the total costs of a project, or delay or prevent its construction, development, expansion or opening. Escalating construction costs may cause us to modify the design and scope of projects from those initially contemplated or cause the budgets for those projects to be increased. We generally carry insurance to cover certain liabilities related to construction, but not all risks are covered, and it is uncertain whether such insurance will provide sufficient payment in a timely fashion even for those risks that are insured and material to us.\nConstruction of our development projects exposes us to risks of cost overruns due to typical construction uncertainties associated with any project or changes in the designs, plans or concepts of such projects. For these and other reasons, construction costs may exceed the estimated cost of completion.\nWe intend to construct an approximately 300-guest-room hotel in Cripple Creek, Colorado, adjoining and connected to our existing Bronco Billy\u2019s casino. This expansion is expected to include a spa, rooftop pool, parking garage, convention and entertainment space, new restaurant, and an expanded and renovated casino, and this expansion is subject to all of the foregoing risks.\nIn addition to the risk factors noted above, our development of the new Cripple Creek casino hotel is exposed to the following significant risks:\n\u25cf risks associated with the failure of completing the project on budget or on time;\n\u25cf risks of having insufficient funds to complete any significant portion of the new Cripple Creek casino hotel in the event construction costs exceed budgeted amounts plus contingencies;\n\u25cf failure to comply with the terms of our disbursement agreement under our indenture could limit our access to funds for the new Cripple Creek casino hotel;\n\u25cf mechanic\u2019s liens on real property collateral may have priority over the liens securing the 2028 Notes; and\n\u25cf there is no assurance that the new Cripple Creek casino hotel will not be subject to additional regulatory delays or challenges as a \u201ccertificate of appropriateness as a project of special merit,\u201d \u201cbuilding height variance\u201d and via the amending of the existing Development Agreement.\nThe construction costs for the new Cripple Creek casino hotel may exceed budgeted amounts plus contingencies, which may result in insufficient funds to complete the expansion of Bronco Billy\u2019s.\nWe do not have final plans and specifications for construction of the new Cripple Creek casino hotel. Delays in the completion of those plans and specifications could delay completion of the new Cripple Creek casino hotel. In addition, completion of the plans and specifications while construction is in progress could cause inefficiencies, and certain items may need to be modified or replaced after they have been purchased, constructed or installed in order to conform to building code\nrequirements or subsequently-developed plans and specifications. The Pre-Construction Services Agreement and Letter of Intent with our general contractor provides that the cost of construction may increase and the deadlines for the contractor\u2019s obligations to complete construction may be adjusted for alterations in the project\u2019s scope. We can give no assurance that changes in the scope of the expansion project will not increase the cost of the project or extend its completion date. We have established the total project budget based, in part, on our estimate of the cost of various construction goods and services for parts of the building that, in some cases, are not yet fully designed. If the actual cost with respect to these allowance items exceeds the estimated amount, we will be responsible for the payment of those excess amounts out of the cash flow from our other operations and from cash balances. Our cash flow or cash reserves may not be adequate at any given time to address balancing of the construction budget if there are increased costs. If our contingency, cash flow from operations and anticipated excess liquidity are insufficient to cover any shortfall, we may not have sufficient funds to complete the new Cripple Creek casino hotel without seeking additional capital or at all.\nThere is no assurance that the new Cripple Creek casino hotel will not be subject to additional regulatory restrictions, delays, or challenges.\nWe received approval of the plans for the new Cripple Creek casino hotel from the Cripple Creek Historic Preservation Commission and Cripple Creek City Council in January and February 2021, respectively. The two Ordinances that were approved in February 2021 do not become effective until 30 days after being published. During that 30-day period, a referendum petition with sufficient signatures could be collected and filed which would then refer the matter to a public vote. Additionally, as part of these approvals, the Cripple Creek City Council voted to amend the prior Development Agreement with Bronco Billy\u2019s regarding the project, as an Amended & Restated Development Agreement. In the Amended & Restated Development Agreement, we are obligated to complete the project by December 31, 2022. If Bronco Billy\u2019s does not complete the project by that date, the City may exercise its right of reversion for the previously vacated right of way of portions of 2nd Avenue and the alley. If the project is substantially underway at the deadline, it is likely that the City Council would agree to extend the deadline; however, there is no certainty that would be the case. Completion of the project could also be delayed by weather, labor shortages or other construction delays. There is no assurance that the new Cripple Creek casino hotel will not be subject to additional restrictions, delays, or challenges, as the project will also require at least the following administrative approvals: a development plan, approved construction drawings required for a building permit, and a certification of occupancy.\nThere is no assurance that the new Cripple Creek casino hotel will be successful.\nIn addition to the construction and regulatory risks associated with the development of the new Cripple Creek casino hotel, we cannot assure you that the level of consumer demand for that casino hotel will meet our expectations. The operating results of the new Cripple Creek casino hotel may be materially different than expected due to, among other factors, consumer spending and preferences in the geographic area, competition from other markets, or other developments that may be beyond our control. In addition, the new casino hotel may be more sensitive than anticipated by management to certain risks, including risks associated with downturns in the economy. Further, the new Cripple Creek casino hotel may not generate cash flows on our anticipated timeline. We may not be able to successfully implement our growth strategy with respect to the new Cripple Creek casino hotel, capital investments, and acquisitions. There is no assurance that the new Cripple Creek casino hotel will result in a more successful business operation, or that a more luxurious hotel, spa, and casino experience will increase clientele or revenues. There is no assurance that a more modern expansion will attract new visitors to a city with historic architecture. The occurrence of any of these issues could adversely affect our prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to comply with the terms of our disbursement agreement could limit our access to funds.\nIn February 2021, we deposited approximately $180 million into the construction disbursement account. The funds in the construction disbursement account, which will be used to fund the completion of the design, development, construction, equipping and opening costs of the new Cripple Creek casino hotel, will be disbursed pursuant to the terms of our Cash Collateral and Disbursement Agreement. Funds will be distributed from this account only upon satisfaction of certain conditions, including the approval of the disbursements by an independent construction consultant, as contemplated by the Cash Collateral and Disbursement Agreement. If we fail to satisfy draw conditions or the independent construction consultant does not give its approval to construction draws, in each case under our Cash Collateral and Disbursement Agreement, we may not have access to funds when needed to pay such costs, which could cause delays in the construction of the new Cripple Creek casino hotel.\nWe face a number of challenges prior to opening new or upgraded facilities.\nNo assurance can be given that, when we endeavor to open new or upgraded facilities, the expected timetables for opening such facilities will be met in light of the uncertainties inherent in the development of the regulatory framework, construction, the licensing process, legislative action and litigation. Delays in opening new or upgraded facilities could lead to increased costs and delays in receiving anticipated revenues with respect to such facilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may face disruption and other difficulties in integrating and managing facilities we have recently developed or acquired, or may develop or acquire in the future.\nWe may face certain challenges as we integrate the operational and administrative systems of recently developed or acquired facilities into our business. As a result, the realization of anticipated benefits may be delayed or substantially reduced. Events outside of our control, including changes in state and federal regulations and laws, as well as economic trends, also could adversely affect our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the acquisition or future development.\nWe expect to continue pursuing expansion opportunities. We regularly evaluate opportunities for acquisition and development of new properties. We could face significant challenges in managing and integrating our expanded or combined operations and any other properties we may develop or acquire, particularly in new competitive markets. The integration of properties we may develop or acquire will require the dedication of management resources that may temporarily divert attention from our day-to-day business. The process of integrating properties that we may acquire also could interrupt the activities of those businesses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the development of new properties may involve construction, local opposition, regulatory, legal and competitive risks, as well as the risks attendant to partnership deals on these development opportunities. In particular, in projects where we team up with a joint venture partner, if we cannot reach agreement with such partners, or our relationships otherwise deteriorate, we could face significant increased costs and delays. Local opposition can delay or increase the anticipated cost of a project. Finally, given the competitive nature of these types of limited license opportunities, litigation is possible.\nManagement of new properties, especially in new geographic areas, may require that we increase our management resources. We cannot assure you that we will be able to manage the combined operations effectively or realize any of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions. We also cannot assure you that, if acquisitions are completed, the acquired businesses will generate returns consistent with our expectations. Our ability to achieve our objectives in connection with any acquisition we may consummate may be highly dependent on, among other things, our ability to retain the senior-level property management teams of such acquisition candidates. If, for any reason, we are unable to retain these management teams following such acquisitions or if we fail to attract new capable executives, our operations after consummation of such acquisitions could be materially adversely affected. If we make new acquisitions or new investments, we may face additional risks related to our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, ability to satisfy financial covenants and comply with other restrictive covenants under our indenture, and ability to pay or refinance our indebtedness.\nThe occurrence of some or all of the above-described events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe construction of the new Cripple Creek casino hotel may inconvenience customers and disrupt business activity at the adjoining Bronco Billy\u2019s casino.\nAlthough we will attempt to minimize disruption of our existing Bronco Billy\u2019s operations, construction of the new Cripple Creek casino hotel will require portions of the adjoining Bronco Billy\u2019s to be closed or disrupted. For example, the Cripple Creek Project will be built, in part, on surface parking lots currently used by guests of Bronco Billy\u2019s. As a result, we will close such parking lots and relocate guest parking until the project\u2019s new parking garage is available for use. Similarly, hotel rooms at Bronco Billy\u2019s will be temporarily unavailable during construction. Any significant disruption in operations at Bronco Billy\u2019s could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditional growth projects or potential enhancements at our properties may require us to raise additional capital.\nWe may need to access financial institution sources, capital markets, private sources or otherwise obtain additional funds to fund additional growth projects or potential enhancements we may undertake at our facilities. We do not know when or if financial institution sources, capital markets or private sources will permit us to raise additional funds for such phases and enhancements in a timely manner, on acceptable terms, or at all. Inability to access financial institution sources, capital markets or private sources, or the availability of capital only on less-than-favorable terms, may force us to delay, reduce or cancel our growth projects and enhancement projects.\nOur ability to obtain financial institution sources, capital markets or private source financing for future offerings may also be limited by our financial condition, results of operations or other factors, such as our credit rating or outlook at the time of any such financing or offering and the covenants in our existing debt agreements, as well as by general economic conditions and contingencies and uncertainties that are beyond our control. As we seek additional financing, we will be subject to the risks of rising interest rates and other factors affecting the financial markets.\nThe casino, hotel and resort industry is capital intensive, and we may not be able to finance expansion and renovation projects, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nOur properties have an ongoing need for renovations and other capital improvements to remain competitive, including replacement, from time to time, of furniture, fixtures and equipment. We may also need to make capital expenditures at our casino properties to comply with our debt covenants, lease agreements and applicable laws and regulations.\nRenovations and other capital improvements at our properties require significant capital expenditures. In addition, renovations and capital improvements usually generate little or no cash flow until the projects are completed. We may not be able to fund such projects solely from existing resources and cash provided from operating activities. Consequently, we may have to rely upon the availability of debt or equity capital to fund renovations and capital improvements, and our ability to carry them out will be limited if we cannot obtain satisfactory debt or equity financing, which will depend on, among other things, market conditions. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional equity or debt financing or that we will be able to obtain such financing on favorable terms. Our failure to renovate our properties may put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nWe may face risks related to our ability to receive regulatory approvals required to complete certain acquisitions, mergers, joint ventures, and other developments, as well as other potential delays in completing certain transactions.\nOur growth may be fueled, in part, by the acquisition of existing gaming and development properties. In addition to standard closing conditions, our material transactions, including but not limited to acquisitions, are often conditioned on the receipt of regulatory approvals and other hurdles that create uncertainty and could increase costs. Such delays could significantly reduce the benefits to us of such transactions and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to obtain necessary government approvals in a timely manner, or at all, it can adversely impact our various expansion, development, investment and renovation projects.\nThe scope of the approvals required for expansion, development, investment or renovation projects can be extensive and may include gaming approvals, state and local land-use permits, and building and zoning permits. Unexpected changes or concessions required by local, state or federal regulatory authorities could involve significant additional costs and delay the scheduled openings of the facilities. We may not obtain the necessary permits, licenses, entitlements and approvals within the anticipated time frames, or at all.\nInsufficient or lower-than-expected results generated from our new developments and acquired properties may negatively affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe cannot assure you that the revenues generated from our new developments and acquired properties will be sufficient to pay related expenses if and when these developments are completed; or, even if revenues are sufficient to pay expenses, that the new developments and acquired properties will yield an adequate return or any return on our significant investments. As\npreviously discussed, the development of new properties may involve construction, regulatory, legal and competitive risks or local opposition, any of which can significantly increase the anticipated cost of a project. Our projects, if completed, may not achieve the level of guest acceptance and patronage we anticipate and, for this or other reasons, may take significantly longer than we expect to generate returns, if any. If our new developments or acquired properties do not achieve the financial results anticipated, it could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. Moreover, lower-than-expected results from the opening of a new facility may make it more difficult to raise capital.\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness\nOur significant indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations.\nAs of February 12, 2021, the total principal amount of our indebtedness, excluding unamortized debt issuance costs, was $315.6 million, consisting of $310 million under the 2028 Notes and $5.6 million for unsecured loans taken under the CARES Act, and for which we intend to seek forgiveness. We also have a finance lease at our Rising Star Casino Resort for $3.8 million.\nThat debt could, among other things:\n\u25cf require us to dedicate a large portion of our cash flow from operations to the servicing and repayment of our debt, thereby reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions, and other general corporate requirements;\n\u25cf limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements;\n\u25cf limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate;\n\u25cf restrict our ability to make strategic acquisitions or dispositions or to exploit business opportunities;\n\u25cf increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions and increases in interest rates;\n\u25cf place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u25cf adversely affect our credit rating or the market price of our common stock.\nAny of these risks could impact our ability to fund our operations or limit our ability to expand our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe indenture governing the 2028 Notes imposes restrictive covenants and limitations that could significantly affect our ability to operate our business and lead to events of default if we do not comply with the covenants.\nThe indenture governing the 2028 Notes imposes restrictive covenants on us and our subsidiaries that may limit our current and future operations. The restrictions that are imposed include, among other obligations, limitations on our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to:\n\u25cf incur additional debt and guarantee indebtedness;\n\u25cf make payments on subordinated obligations;\n\u25cf make dividends or distributions and repurchase stock;\n\u25cf make investments;\n\u25cf enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u25cf grant liens on our property to secure debt;\n\u25cf sell assets or enter into mergers or consolidations;\n\u25cf sell equity interest in our subsidiaries;\n\u25cf make capital expenditures; or\n\u25cf amend or modify our subordinate indebtedness without obtaining certain consents from the holders of our indebtedness.\nThese restrictions could adversely affect our ability to:\n\u25cf obtain additional financing for our operations;\n\u25cf make needed capital expenditures;\n\u25cf make strategic acquisitions or investments or enter into alliances;\n\u25cf withstand a continued and sustained downturn in our business or the economy in general;\n\u25cf engage in business activities, including future opportunities, that may be in our interest; and\n\u25cf plan for or react to market conditions or otherwise execute our business strategies.\nOur ability to comply with the covenants under the indenture, or in any instrument governing future indebtedness, may be affected by general economic conditions, industry conditions, and other events beyond our control, including delays in the completion of new projects under construction. As a result, there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with these covenants. Our failure to comply with the covenants contained under the indenture, or in any instrument governing future indebtedness, including failure to comply as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default. If there were an event of default and it is not waived by the requisite parties (at their option), the agent, the trustee or holders, as applicable, could cause all the outstanding obligations under the 2028 Notes or other future indebtedness to be due and payable, subject to applicable grace periods, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition. Additionally, this could trigger cross-defaults under other debt obligations. We cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to repay our obligations under the 2028 Notes, or any future outstanding debt obligations, if accelerated upon an event of default, particularly in light of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on our business, cash flows and liquidity, or that we would be able to borrow sufficient funds to refinance the 2028 Notes or any future debt instruments.\nTo service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, and to fund planned capital expenditures and expansion efforts, will depend upon our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors, including the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.\nWe cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or asset sales, our anticipated growth in operations, including through our expansion efforts, will be realized, or that future borrowings will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to repay the 2028 Notes and to fund our other liquidity needs. In addition, as we undertake substantial new developments or facility renovations or if we consummate significant acquisitions in the future, our cash requirements may increase significantly and we may need to obtain additional equity or debt financing or joint venture partners. Any increase in our level of indebtedness could impose additional cash requirements on us in order to support interest payments. If we incur additional debt, the related risks that we now face could intensify.\nIf we are not able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to repay the 2028 Notes, as needed, or to obtain adequate additional financing, we may have to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying planned expenses and capital expenditures, selling assets, or issuing equity.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to service all of our indebtedness and fund our operating expenses, working capital needs and capital expenditures, and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our indebtedness will depend upon our future operating performance and our ability to generate cash flow in the future, which are subject to general economic, financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or fund our other liquidity needs. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investment and capital expenditures, dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to affect any such alternative measures, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, such alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. The\nindenture governing the 2028 Notes restricts our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from asset dispositions, and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to repay or service our indebtedness. If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and, as a result, our lenders could declare all outstanding amounts to be due and payable and foreclose against the collateral securing such debt, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and could result in you losing your investment in us.\nWe depend on our subsidiaries for certain dividends, distributions and repayment of our indebtedness, including the 2028 Notes.\nThe source of much of our cash flow to pay our obligations under the 2028 Notes and make payments on any other indebtedness will be dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries. If our subsidiaries are unable to make dividend payments or distributions to us and sufficient cash or liquidity is not otherwise available, we may not be able to pay interest or principal under the 2028 Notes. Unless they guarantee the 2028 Notes, our subsidiaries will not have any obligation to pay amounts due under the 2028 Notes or to make funds available for that purpose. Unless they guarantee the 2028 Notes, our subsidiaries may not be able to, or be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness, including the 2028 Notes. Each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. In addition, while the indenture governing the 2028 Notes limits the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to restrict the payment of dividends or make other intercompany payments to us, these limitations will be subject to certain qualifications and exceptions. In the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, including the 2028 Notes.\nOur ability to obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms may be limited.\nAlthough we believe that our cash, cash equivalents, working capital, future cash from operations, and the capital obtained from the 2028 Notes will provide adequate resources to fund completion of the Cripple Creek Project and ongoing operating requirements, we may need to refinance or seek additional financing to compete effectively or grow our business. These financing strategies may not be completed on satisfactory terms, if at all. In addition, certain financing transactions require approval of gaming regulatory authorities. Some requirements may prevent or delay us from obtaining necessary capital. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain any additional financing, refinance our existing debt, or fund our growth efforts. If we are unable to obtain financing on commercially reasonable terms, it could:\n\u25cf reduce funds available to us for purposes such as working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u25cf restrict our ability to capitalize on business opportunities;\n\u25cf increase our vulnerability to economic downturns and competitive pressures in the markets in which we operate; and\n\u25cf place us at a competitive disadvantage.\nThe obligations under the 2028 Notes are collateralized by a security interest in substantially all of our assets, so if we default on those obligations, the holders of the 2028 Notes could foreclose on our assets. In addition, the existence of these security interests may adversely affect our financial flexibility.\nThe obligations under the 2028 Notes are secured by a security interest in substantially all of our assets. As a result, if we default under our obligations under the 2028 Notes, the holders of the 2028 Notes, acting through their appointed agent, could foreclose on their security interests and liquidate some or all of these assets, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations and could require us to reduce or cease operations. In addition, the pledge of these assets and other restrictions may limit our flexibility in raising capital for other purposes. Because substantially all of our assets are pledged under these financing arrangements, our ability to incur additional secured indebtedness or to sell or dispose of assets to raise capital may be impaired, which could have an adverse effect on our financial flexibility.\nOur loans under the CARES Act may be subject to regulatory review.\nOn May 8, 2020, two wholly-owned subsidiaries, each of which has less than 500 employees, executed promissory notes, each with a five-year term, evidencing unsecured loans in the aggregate amount of $5,606,200 through programs\nestablished under the CARES Act and administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration. Such program was established for companies like ours, which were heavily impacted by the business shutdowns and uncertainties created by the pandemic, and encouraged us to retain or rehire employees who may have been unemployed. The application for the unsecured loans required us to certify, among other things, that the economic uncertainty created by the pandemic made the loan requests necessary to support our ongoing operations. We made this certification in good faith after analyzing, among other things, our financial situation (including our relatively small size and high leverage) and our lack of access to alternative forms of capital at such time in light of the required closure of all of our operations and uncertainty surrounding reopening dates. We believe that we satisfied all eligibility criteria for the loans. However, the certification required in the CARES Act application includes subjective criteria and is subject to interpretation. Others may interpret the criteria differently. If we are subsequently found to have been ineligible to receive the loans, we may be required to repay the loans prior to their maturity. We may also be subject to certain penalties with respect to the loans. We intend to seek forgiveness for all of our CARES Act loans, which will also require us to make certain certifications that will be subject to audit and review by governmental entities. While we believe we qualify for such forgiveness, there is no certainty that any or all of the loans will be forgiven. Any of these events could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt, which could further exacerbate the risks described above.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. The indenture governing the 2028 Notes does not fully prohibit us or our subsidiaries from doing so, and specifically allows for a $15 million revolving credit facility (which allowance increases to $25 million upon the opening of the Cripple Creek Project). If new debt is added to our, or our subsidiaries\u2019, current debt levels, the related risks that we or they now face could intensify.\nRisks Related to our Legal and Regulatory Environment\nWe face extensive regulation from gaming and other regulatory authorities and the cost of compliance or failure to comply with such regulations may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nLicensing. The gaming industry is highly regulated, and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations. The ownership, management and operation of gaming facilities are subject to extensive state and local regulation in the jurisdiction in which it is located. These laws, rules and regulations generally concern the responsibility, financial stability and character of the owners, managers, and persons with financial interest in the gaming operations. The regulatory authorities in jurisdictions where we operate have broad discretion, and may, for any reason set forth in the applicable legislation, rules and regulations, limit, condition, suspend, fail to renew or revoke a license or registration to conduct gaming operations. Furthermore, because we are subject to regulation in each jurisdiction in which we operate, and because regulatory agencies within each jurisdiction review our compliance with gaming laws in other jurisdictions, it is possible that gaming compliance issues in one jurisdiction may lead to reviews and compliance issues in other jurisdictions.\nTaxation and fees. We believe that the prospect of significant tax revenue is one of the primary reasons that jurisdictions permit legalized gaming. As a result, gaming companies are typically subject to significant revenue-based taxes and fees in addition to normal federal, state, local and provincial income and employment taxes, and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time. We pay substantial taxes and fees with respect to our operations. From time to time, federal, state, local and provincial legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws, or in the administration of such laws, affecting the gaming industry. In addition, any downturn in economic conditions could intensify the efforts of state and local governments to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes and/or property taxes. It is not possible to determine with certainty the likelihood of changes in tax laws or in the administration of such laws. Any material increase, or the adoption of additional taxes or fees, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCompliance with other laws. In addition to gaming regulations, we are also subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations affecting businesses in general. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, environmental matters, employment, currency transactions, taxation, construction, zoning, construction and land-use laws, marketing and advertising, smoking, and regulations governing the serving of alcoholic beverages.\nThe Bank Secrecy Act, enforced by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (\u201cFinCEN\u201d) of the U.S. Treasury Department, requires us to report currency transactions in excess of $10,000 occurring within a gaming day, including identification of the guest by name and social security number, to the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d). This regulation also requires us to report certain suspicious activity, including any transaction that exceeds $5,000 that we know, suspect or have reason to believe involves funds from illegal activity or is designed to evade federal regulations or reporting requirements. Periodic audits by the IRS and our internal audit function assess compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act, and substantial penalties can be imposed against us if we fail to comply with this regulation. In recent years, the U.S. Treasury Department has increased its focus on Bank Secrecy Act compliance throughout the gaming industry. Recent public comments by FinCEN suggest that casinos should make efforts to obtain information on each customer\u2019s sources of income. This could impact our ability to attract and retain casino guests.\nWe also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. Any violations of anti-money laundering laws or regulations by any of our properties could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted.\nOur riverboat, as well as our ferry boat operations, at Rising Star must comply with certain federal and state laws and regulations with respect to boat design, on-board facilities, equipment, personnel and safety. In addition, we are required to have third parties periodically inspect and certify our casino riverboat for safety, stability and single compartment flooding integrity. All of our casinos also must meet local fire safety standards. We could incur additional costs if our gaming facilities are not in compliance with one or more of these regulations.\nChanges in legislation and regulation of our business could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRegulations governing the conduct of gaming activities and the obligations of gaming companies in any jurisdiction in which we have or in the future may have gaming operations are subject to change and could impose additional operating, financial, competitive or other burdens on the way we conduct our business.\nIn particular, certain areas of law governing new gaming activities, such as the federal and state law applicable to sports betting, are new or developing in light of emerging technologies. New and developing areas of law may be subject to the interpretation of the government agencies tasked with enforcing them. In some circumstances, a government agency may interpret a statute or regulation in one manner and then reconsider its interpretation at a later date. No assurance can be provided that government agencies will interpret or enforce new or developing areas of law consistently, predictably, or favorably. Moreover, legislation to prohibit, limit or add burdens to our business may be introduced in the future in states where gaming has been legalized. In addition, from time to time, legislators and special interest groups have proposed legislation that would expand, restrict or prevent gaming operations or which may otherwise adversely impact our operations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Any expansion of gaming or restriction on or prohibition of our gaming operations or enactment of other adverse regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. For example, in January 2019, legal counsel for the U.S. Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) issued a legal opinion on the Interstate Wire Act of 1961 (\u201cWire Act\u201d), which stated that the Wire Act bans any form of online gambling if it crosses state lines and reversed a 2011 DOJ legal opinion that stated that the Wire Act only applied to interstate sports betting. The validity of the 2019 DOJ legal opinion and the conflicting interpretations of the Wire Act by DOJ is presently the subject of ongoing litigation.\nStockholders may be required to dispose of their shares of our common stock if they are found unsuitable by gaming authorities.\nWhile gaming authorities generally focus on stockholders with more than 5% and often 10% of a company\u2019s shares, such authorities generally can require that any beneficial owner of our common stock and other securities file an application for a finding of suitability. If a gaming authority requires a record or beneficial owner of our securities to file a suitability application, the owner must apply for a finding of suitability within 30 days or at an earlier time prescribed by the gaming authority. The gaming authority has the power to investigate an owner\u2019s suitability and the owner must pay all costs of the investigation. If the owner is found unsuitable, then the owner may be required by law to dispose of our securities. Our certificate of incorporation also provides us with the right to repurchase shares of our common stock from certain beneficial owners declared by gaming\nregulators to be unsuitable holders of our equity securities. The price we may pay to any such beneficial owner may be below the price such beneficial owner would otherwise accept for his or her shares of our common stock.\nWe are subject to environmental laws and potential exposure to environmental liabilities.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern our operations, including emissions and discharges into the environment, and the handling and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous substances and wastes. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in costs for corrective action, penalties or the imposition of other liabilities or restrictions. We also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and clean-up responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Under certain of these laws and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of remediating contaminated soil or groundwater on or from its property, without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or caused, the contamination, as well as incur liability to third parties impacted by such contamination. The presence of contamination, or failure to remediate it properly, may adversely affect our ability to use, sell or rent property. There can be no assurances that these matters or other matters arising under environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations in the future.\nWe are subject to litigation which, if adversely determined, could cause us to incur substantial losses.\nFrom time to time during the normal course of operating our businesses, we are subject to various litigation claims and legal disputes. Some of the litigation claims may not be covered under our insurance policies, or our insurance carriers may seek to deny coverage. As a result, we might also be required to incur significant legal fees, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position. In addition, because we cannot accurately predict the outcome of any action, it is possible that, as a result of current and/or future litigation, we will be subject to adverse judgments or settlements that could significantly reduce our earnings or result in losses.\nOur ferry boat service is highly regulated, which can adversely affect our operations.\nOur ferry boat service at the Rising Star Casino Resort is subject to stringent local, state and federal laws and regulations governing, among other things, the health and safety of our passengers and personnel, and the operation and insurance of our vessel. Many aspects of our ferry boat service are subject to regulation by a wide array of agencies, including the U.S. Coast Guard and other federal authorities, the State of Indiana and Commonwealth of Kentucky authorities, as well as local authorities in Ohio County, Indiana and Boone County, Kentucky. In addition, we are required by various governmental and quasi-governmental agencies to obtain, maintain and periodically renew certain permits, licenses and certificates with respect to our ferry boat service. Compliance with or the enforcement of applicable laws and regulations can be costly. In addition, failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may result in administrative and civil penalties, criminal sanctions or, in certain cases, the suspension or termination of our ferry boat service.\nRisks Related to Technology\nOur gaming operations rely heavily on technology services and an uninterrupted supply of electrical power and if we experience damage or service interruptions, we may have to cease some or all of our operations, which will result in a decrease in revenue.\nOur gaming operations rely heavily on technology services and an uninterrupted supply of electrical power. Our security system and all of our slot machines are controlled by computers and reliant on electrical power to operate. A loss of electrical power or a failure of the technology services needed to run the computers could make us unable to run all or parts of our gaming operations. Any unscheduled interruption in our technology services or interruption in the supply of electrical power is likely to result in an immediate, and possibly substantial, loss of revenue due to a shutdown of our gaming operations. Although we have designed our systems around industry-standard designs to reduce downtime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences, they remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks and similar events. Additionally, substantial increases in the cost of electricity and natural gas could negatively affect our results of operations.\nOur information technology and other systems are subject to cyber-security risk, misappropriation of customer information and other breaches of information security.\nWe rely extensively on our computer systems to process customer transactions, manage customer data, manage employee data and communicate with third-party vendors and other third parties, and we may also access the Internet to use our computer systems. Our operations require that we collect and store customer data, including credit card numbers and other personal information, for various business purposes, including marketing and promotional purposes. We also collect and store personal information about our employees. Breaches of our security measures or information technology systems or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive personal information or confidential data about us, or our customers, or our employees including the potential loss or disclosure of such information as a result of hacking or other cyber-attack, computer virus, fraudulent use by customers, employees or employees of third party vendors, trickery or other forms of deception or unauthorized use, or due to system failure, could expose us, our customers, our employees or other individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our reputation or brand names or otherwise harm our business. Additionally, disruptions in the availability of our computer systems, through cyber-attacks or otherwise, could impact our ability to service our customers and adversely affect our sales and the results of operations. We rely on proprietary and commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of customer information, such as payment card, employee information and other confidential or proprietary information. Our data security measures are reviewed and evaluated regularly; however, they might not protect us against increasingly sophisticated and aggressive threats. The cost and operational consequences of implementing further data security measures could be significant and there is no certainty that such measures, if purchased, could thwart all threats. Additionally, while we maintain cyber risk insurance to assist in the cost of recovery from a significant cyber event, such coverage may not be sufficient.\nAdditionally, the collection of customer and employee personal information imposes various privacy compliance related obligations on our business and increases the risks associated with a breach or failure of the integrity of our information technology systems. The collection and use of personal information are governed by privacy laws and regulations enacted in the United States and other jurisdictions around the world. Privacy regulations continue to evolve and on occasion may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. Compliance with applicable privacy laws and regulations may increase our operating costs and/or adversely impact our ability to market our products, properties and services to our customers. In addition, non-compliance with applicable privacy laws and regulations by us (or in some circumstances non-compliance by third party service providers engaged by us) may also result in damage of reputation, result in vulnerabilities that could be exploited to breach our systems and/or subject us to fines, payment of damages, lawsuits or restrictions on our use or transfer of personal information.\nGeneral Risks\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nOur ability to utilize our NOL carryforwards to offset potential future taxable income and related income taxes that would otherwise be due is dependent upon our generation of future taxable income before the expiration dates, if applicable, of the NOL carryforwards, and we cannot predict with certainty when, or whether, we will generate sufficient taxable income to use all of our NOL carryforwards.\nUnder Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point change (by value) in its equity ownership by certain stockholders over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change NOL carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research and development tax credits) to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. We have experienced ownership changes in the past, and we may experience ownership changes in the future and/or subsequent shifts in our stock ownership (some of which may be outside our control). As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change NOL carryforwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income may be subject to limitations under Section 382, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of NOL carryforwards is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed.\nThe market price for our common stock may be volatile, and investors may not be able to sell our stock at a favorable price or at all.\nMany factors could cause the market price of our common stock to rise and fall, including:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly results of operations;\n\u25cf the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on our business;\n\u25cf change in market valuations of companies in our industry;\n\u25cf change in expectations of future financial performance;\n\u25cf regulatory changes;\n\u25cf fluctuations in stock market prices and volumes;\n\u25cf issuance of common stock market prices and volumes;\n\u25cf the addition or departure of key personnel; and\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, investments, dispositions, joint ventures or other significant business decisions.\nIn addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to companies\u2019 operating performance, for example, as a result of the coronavirus epidemic. Broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, stockholder derivative lawsuits and/or securities class-action litigation has sometimes been instituted against that company. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nThe exercise of outstanding options to purchase common stock may result in substantial dilution and may depress the trading price of our common stock.\nIf our outstanding options to purchase shares of our common stock are exercised and the underlying shares of common stock issued upon such exercise are sold, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution and the market price of our shares of common stock could decline. Further, the perception that such securities might be exercised could adversely affect the trading price of our shares of common stock. During the time that such securities are outstanding, they may adversely affect the terms on which we could obtain additional capital.", "PERMNO": 79490, "SIC": 7990, "TIC": "FLL"}
