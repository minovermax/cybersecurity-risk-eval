Risk Factors\nRisk Factors\nOur business, operations and financial position are subject to various risks. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the audited annual financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10-K, when evaluating your investment in our Class A common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties of which we are unaware or that we currently deem immaterial also may become important factors that affect the Company. If any of the following risks are realized, our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. Some statements in this Form 10-K, including statements in the following risk factors, constitute forward-looking statements. Please refer to \u201cForward Looking Statements - Cautionary Language.\u201d\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industry\nThe market for healthcare in the United States is in the early stages of structural change and is rapidly evolving, which makes it difficult to forecast demand for our products and services.\nThe market for healthcare in the United States is in the early stages of structural change and is rapidly evolving. Our future financial performance will depend in part on growth in this market and on our ability to adapt to emerging demands of this market. It is difficult to predict with any precision the future growth rate and size of our target market.\nThe rapidly evolving nature of the market in which we operate, as well as other factors that are beyond our control, reduce our ability to accurately evaluate our long-term outlook and forecast annual performance. We believe demand for our products and services has been driven in large part by price pressure in traditional FFS healthcare, a regulatory environment that is incentivizing value-based care models, a rapid expansion of retail insurance, broader use of the Internet and advances in technology. Widespread acceptance of the value-based care model is critical to our future growth and success. A reduction in demand for our products and services caused by lack of acceptance, technological challenges, competing offerings or other factors would result in a lower revenue growth rate or decreased revenue, either of which could negatively impact our business and results of operations. In addition, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if healthcare reform is not implemented in accordance with our expectations or if it is amended in a way that impacts our business and results in our failure to execute our growth strategies.\nIf we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business and results of operations could be harmed.\nWe have expanded our operations significantly since our inception. For example, we grew from six full-time employees at inception to 946 employees as of December 31, 2015, and our revenue increased from $25.7 million for 2013 to $96.9 million for 2015. If we do not effectively manage our growth as we continue to expand, the quality of our products and services could suffer. Our growth to date has increased the significant demands on our management, our operational and financial systems and infrastructure and other resources. In order to successfully expand our business, we must effectively recruit, integrate and motivate new employees, while maintaining the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture. We may not be able to hire new employees quickly enough to meet our needs. If we fail to effectively manage our hiring needs and successfully integrate our new hires, our efficiency and ability to meet our forecasts and our employee morale, productivity and retention could suffer, and our business and results of operations could be harmed. We must also continue to improve our existing systems for operational and financial management, including our reporting systems, procedures and controls. These improvements could require significant capital expenditures and place increasing demands on our management. We may not be successful in managing or expanding our operations or in maintaining adequate financial and operating systems and controls. If we do not successfully manage these processes, our business and results of operations could be harmed.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from our largest partners.\nHistorically, we have relied on a limited number of partners for a substantial portion of our total revenue and accounts receivable. Our five largest partners in 2015, Piedmont WellStar Health Plan, Indiana University Health, WakeMed Health and Hospitals, Premier Health Partners and MedStar Health, Inc. comprised 19.6%, 15.6%, 14.1%, 11.8% and 11.2%, respectively, of our revenue for 2015, or 72.3% in the aggregate. Our four largest partners in terms of accounts receivable in 2015, Premier Health Partners, Piedmont WellStar Health Plan, Indiana University Health and Baptist Health, comprised approximately 28.1%, 23.2%, 12.9% and 11.4%, respectively, of such total amount as of December 31, 2015. The sudden loss of any of our partners, including our new strategic alliance partner, University Health Care, Inc., d/b/a Passport Health Plan, as discussed in \u201cPart II - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Business Overview,\u201d or the renegotiation of any of our partner contracts, could adversely affect our operating results. For example, in 2015 we signed two amendments to our agreement with Piedmont WellStar Health Plan that reduced our expected revenue under that contract. Revenue estimates are based on various assumptions and may vary depending on the performance of our partner\u2019s health plan and other factors. We expect our 2016 revenue attributable to\nthat contract to be approximately 75% of our revenue attributable to that contract in 2015 or approximately 50% of our adjusted revenue attributable to that contract in 2015, with minimal revenue anticipated in subsequent years. In connection with the amendment signed in April 2015, the partner also sold its 2.2% ownership interest in us to certain of our pre-IPO investors, consisting of TPG, The Advisory Board and UPMC. In addition, as a result of an amendment to our agreement with WakeMed Health and Hospitals described in \u201cPart II - Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Business Overview,\u201d revenue we recognize in 2016 attributable to WakeMed Health and Hospitals will be limited to approximately 60% of our 2015 revenue attributable to this customer.\nBecause we rely on a limited number of partners for a significant portion of our revenues, we depend on the creditworthiness of these partners. If the financial condition of our partners declines, our credit risk could increase. Should one or more of our significant partners declare bankruptcy, it could adversely affect the collectability of our accounts receivable and affect our bad debt reserves and net income.\nAlthough we have long-term contracts with our partners, these contracts may be terminated before their term expires for various reasons, such as changes in the regulatory landscape and poor performance by us, subject to certain conditions. For example, after a specified period, certain of these contracts are terminable for convenience by our partners after a notice period has passed and the partner has paid a termination fee. Certain of our contracts are terminable immediately upon the occurrence of certain events. For example, some of our contracts may be terminated by the partner if we fail to achieve target performance metrics over a specified period. Certain of our contracts may be terminated by the partner immediately following repeated failures by us to provide specified levels of service over periods ranging from six months to more than a year. Certain of our contracts may be terminated immediately by the partner if we lose applicable licenses, go bankrupt, lose our liability insurance or receive an exclusion, suspension or debarment from state or federal government authorities. In addition, one of our contracts may be terminated immediately if we become insolvent or file for bankruptcy. If any of our contracts with our partners is terminated, we may not be able to recover all fees due under the terminated contract, which may adversely affect our operating results.\nIf we are unable to offer new and innovative products and services or our products and services fail to keep pace with advances in industry standards, technology and our partners\u2019 needs, our partners may terminate or fail to renew their relationship with us and our revenue and results of operations may suffer.\nOur success depends on providing high-quality products and services that healthcare providers use to improve clinical, financial and operational performance. If we cannot adapt to rapidly evolving industry standards, technology and increasingly sophisticated and varied partner needs, our existing technology could become undesirable, obsolete or harm our reputation. We must continue to invest significant resources in our personnel and technology in a timely and cost-effective manner in order to enhance our existing products and services and introduce new high-quality products and services that existing partners and potential new partners will want. Our operating results would also suffer if our innovations are not responsive to the needs of our existing partners or potential new partners, are not appropriately timed with market opportunity, are not effectively brought to market or significantly increase our operating costs. If our new or modified product and service innovations are not responsive to partner preferences, emerging industry standards or regulatory changes, are not appropriately timed with market opportunity or are not effectively brought to market, we may lose existing partners or be unable to obtain new partners and our results of operations may suffer. In addition, should any of our partners terminate their relationship with us after implementation has begun, we would not only lose our time, effort and resources invested in that implementation, but we would also have lost the opportunity to leverage those resources to build a relationship with other partners over that same period of time.\nWe also engage third-party vendors to develop, maintain and enhance our technology solutions, and our ability to develop and implement new technologies is therefore dependent on our ability to engage suitable vendors. We may also need to license software or technology from third parties in order to maintain, expand or modify our technology platform. However, there is no guarantee we will be able to enter into such agreements on acceptable terms or at all. The functionality of our platform depends, in part, on our ability to integrate it with third-party applications and data management systems that our partners use and from which they obtain data. These third parties may terminate their relationships with us, change the features of their applications and platforms, restrict our access to their applications and platforms or alter the terms governing use of their applications, data management systems and application programming interfaces and access to those applications and platforms in an adverse manner.\nThe growth of our business relies, in part, on the growth and success of our partners and certain revenues from our engagements, which are difficult to predict and are subject to factors outside of our control.\nWe enter into agreements with our partners under which a significant portion of our fees are variable, including fees which are dependent upon the number of members that are covered by our partner\u2019s healthcare plan each month, expansion of our partners and the services that we provide, as well as performance-based metrics. The number of members covered by a partner\u2019s healthcare plan is often impacted by factors outside of our control, such as the actions of our partner or third parties. Accordingly, revenue under these agreements is unpredictable. If the number of members covered by one or more of our partner\u2019s plans were to be reduced by a material amount, such decrease would lead to a decrease in our revenue, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, growth forecasts of our partners are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions\nand estimates that may prove to be inaccurate. Even if the markets in which our partners compete meet the size estimates and growth forecasted, their health plan membership could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all. In addition, a portion of the revenue under certain of our long-term contracts is tied to the customer\u2019s continued participation in specified payer programs over which we have no control. If the customer ceases to participate in any such program, such decision would lead to a decrease in our expected revenue under the relevant contract.\nIn addition, the transition to value-based care may be challenging for our partners. For example, fully capitated provider risk arrangements have had a history of financial challenges for providers. Our partners may also have difficulty in value-based care if premium pricing is under pressure. Furthermore, revenue under our partner contracts may differ from our projections because of the termination of the contract for cause or at specified life cycle events, or because of fee reductions that are occasionally given after the contract is initially signed.\nIf we do not continue to attract new partners, we may not achieve our revenue projections, and our results of operations would be harmed.\nIn order to grow our business, we must continually attract new partners. Our ability to do so depends in large part on the success of our sales and marketing efforts. Potential partners may seek out other options. Therefore, we must demonstrate that our products and services provide a viable solution for potential partners. If we fail to provide high-quality solutions and convince individual partners of our value proposition, we may not be able to retain existing partners or attract new partners. In addition, there may be a limited-time opportunity to achieve and maintain a significant share of the market for our products and services due in part to the rapidly evolving nature of the healthcare and technology industries and the substantial resources available to our existing and potential competitors. If the market for our products and services declines or grows more slowly than we expect, or if the number of individual partners that use our solutions declines or fails to increase as we expect, our revenue, results of operations, financial condition, business and prospects could be harmed.\nWe typically incur significant upfront costs in our partner relationships, and if we are unable to develop or grow these partner relationships over time, we are unlikely to recover these costs and our operating results may suffer.\nWe devote significant resources to establish relationships with our partners and for 2015, our business development expenses represented approximately 8% of our total revenues. Some of our partners undertake a significant and prolonged evaluation process, including to determine whether our products and services meet their unique health system needs, which has in the past resulted in extended periods of time to establish a long-term partner relationship. Our efforts involve educating our partners about the use, technical capabilities and benefits of our products and services. Accordingly, our operating results will depend in substantial part on our ability to deliver a successful partner experience and persuade our partners to grow their relationship with us over time. There is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully convert a customer of our transformation services into a partner of our platform and operations services. If we are unable to sell additional products and services to existing partners, enter into and maintain favorable relationships with new partners or sufficiently grow our partners\u2019 lives on platform, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As we expect to grow rapidly, our customer acquisition costs could outpace our build-up of recurring revenue, and we may be unable to reduce our total operating costs through economies of scale such that we are unable to achieve profitability. In addition, we estimate the costs and timing for completing the transformation phase, including the Blueprint phase, of the partner relationship. These estimates reflect our best judgment. Any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays, including delays caused by factors outside our control, could cause our operating results to suffer.\nIf the estimates and assumptions we use to determine the size of our target market are inaccurate, our future growth rate may be impacted and our business would be harmed.\nMarket opportunity estimates and growth forecasts are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may not prove to be accurate. The estimates and forecasts in this Form 10-K relating to the size and expected growth of the market for our services may prove to be inaccurate. Even if the market in which we compete meets our size estimates and forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all.\nThe principal assumptions relating to our market opportunity include health insurance expenditures, the total percentage of payments providers receive under value-based contracting, the size of the provider-sponsored health plan market and the fees we believe we can charge. Our market opportunity is also based on the assumption that the strategic approach that our solution enables for our potential partners will be more attractive to our partners than competing solutions. The solution we offer our target market contemplates one strategic option-to pursue clinical and technological integration to reduce utilization and total cost-among several such options our potential partners may pursue to achieve their objectives. Our potential partners may elect to pursue a different strategic option.\nIf these assumptions prove inaccurate, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. For more information regarding our estimates of market opportunity and the forecasts of market growth included in this Form 10-K, see \u201cPart I - Item 1. Business.\u201d\nIf we are not able to maintain and enhance our reputation and brand recognition, our business and results of operations will be harmed.\nWe believe that maintaining and enhancing our reputation and brand recognition is critical to our relationships with existing partners and to our ability to attract new partners. The promotion of our brand may require us to make substantial investments and we anticipate that, as our market becomes increasingly competitive, these marketing initiatives may become increasingly difficult and expensive. Our marketing activities may not be successful or yield increased revenue, and to the extent that these activities yield increased revenue, the increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incur and our results of operations could be harmed. In addition, any factor that diminishes our reputation or that of our management, including failing to meet the expectations of our partners, could make it substantially more difficult for us to attract new partners. Similarly, because our existing partners often act as references for us with prospective new partners, any existing partner that questions the quality of our work or that of our employees could impair our ability to secure additional new partners. If we do not successfully maintain and enhance our reputation and brand recognition, our business may not grow and we could lose our relationships with partners, which would harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nConsolidation in the healthcare industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMany healthcare industry participants and payers are consolidating to create larger and more integrated healthcare delivery systems with greater market power. We expect regulatory and economic conditions to result in additional consolidation in the healthcare industry in the future. As consolidation accelerates, the economies of scale of our partners\u2019 organizations may grow. If a partner experiences sizable growth following consolidation, it may determine that it no longer needs to rely on us and may reduce its demand for our products and services. In addition, as healthcare providers consolidate to create larger and more integrated healthcare delivery systems with greater market power, these providers may try to use their market power to negotiate fee reductions for our products and services. Finally, consolidation may also result in the acquisition or future development by our partners of products and services that compete with our products and services. Any of these potential results of consolidation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may face intense competition, which could limit our ability to maintain or expand market share within our industry, and if we do not maintain or expand our market share our business and operating results will be harmed.\nThe market for our products and services is fragmented, competitive and characterized by rapidly evolving technology standards, customer needs and the frequent introduction of new products and services. Our competitors range from smaller niche companies to large, well-financed and technologically-sophisticated entities.\nWe compete on the basis of several factors, including breadth, depth and quality of product and service offerings, ability to deliver clinical, financial and operational performance improvement through the use of products and services, quality and reliability of services, ease of use and convenience, brand recognition and the ability to integrate services with existing technology. Some of our competitors are more established, benefit from greater brand recognition, have larger client bases and have substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources. Other competitors have proprietary technology that differentiates their product and service offerings from ours. Our competitors are constantly developing products and services that may become more efficient or appealing to our existing partners and potential partners. Additionally, some healthcare information technology providers have begun to incorporate enhanced analytical tools and functionality into their core product and service offerings used by healthcare providers. As a result of these competitive advantages, our competitors and potential competitors may be able to respond more quickly to market forces, undertake more extensive marketing campaigns for their brands, products and services and make more attractive offers to our existing partners and potential partners.\nWe also compete on the basis of price. We may be subject to pricing pressures as a result of, among other things, competition within the industry, consolidation of healthcare industry participants, practices of managed care organizations, government action and financial stress experienced by our partners. If our pricing experiences significant downward pressure, our business will be less profitable and our results of operations will be adversely affected.\nWe cannot be certain that we will be able to retain our current partners or expand our partner base in this competitive environment. If we do not retain current partners or expand our partner base, or if we have to renegotiate existing contracts, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be harmed. Moreover, we expect that competition will continue to increase as a result of consolidation in both the healthcare information technology and healthcare industries. If one or more of our competitors or potential competitors were to merge or partner with another of our competitors, the change in the competitive landscape could also adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nExclusivity and right of first refusal clauses in some of our partner and founder contracts may prohibit us from partnering with certain other providers in the future, and as a result may limit our growth.\nSome of our partner and founder contracts include exclusivity and right of first refusal clauses. Any founder contracts with exclusivity, right of first refusal or other restrictive provisions may limit our ability to conduct business with certain potential partners, including competitors of our founders. For example, under the UPMC IP Agreement, if we were to conduct business with certain precluded providers, it would result in the loss of the license thereunder. Partner contracts with exclusivity or other restrictive provisions may limit our ability to partner with or provide services to other providers or purchase services from other vendors within certain time periods. These exclusivity or other restrictive provisions often apply to specific competitors of our health system partners or specific geographic areas within a particular state or an entire state. Accordingly, these exclusivity clauses may prevent us from entering into long-term relationships with potential partners and could cause our business, financial condition and results of operations to be harmed.\nIn addition, we entered into a services, reseller and non-competition agreement with The Advisory Board, which we refer to as The Advisory Board Reseller Agreement, that, among other things, prohibits us from promoting, marketing, offering or selling certain unbundled technology services, consulting services unless reasonably expected to lead to a long-term services contract or be part of a Blueprint engagement, or certain other services that are substantially similar to or competitive with certain Advisory Board services. Accordingly, that agreement prohibits us from selling such software or technology services on a standalone basis, but permits us to sell such services if they are part of an integrated offering to our partners and such services account for no more than 50% of the aggregate revenue attributable to our partner during the term of the contract. The Advisory Board Reseller Agreement also prohibits us from promoting, marketing, offering or selling consulting services that are not intended to be a part of our Blueprint services or any services that are substantially similar to or competitive with certain Advisory Board services. These restrictions are in effect until the earlier of June 27, 2020, and the date on which The Advisory Board no longer holds shares of our common stock. We have also entered into a reseller, services and non-competition agreement with an affiliate of UPMC, which we refer to as the UPMC Reseller Agreement, pursuant to which we are prohibited from contracting with third parties to provide certain TPA services for a certain time period. These restrictions could cause our business, financial condition and results of operations to be harmed if we found it advantageous to obtain TPA services from a third party or offer certain services, including unbundled software or technology services, during the restricted period.\nThe healthcare regulatory and political framework is uncertain and evolving.\nHealthcare laws and regulations are rapidly evolving and may change significantly in the future, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. For example, in March 2010, the ACA was adopted, which is a healthcare reform measure that provides healthcare insurance for approximately 30 million more Americans. The ACA includes a variety of healthcare reform provisions and requirements that will become effective at varying times through 2018 and substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, which may significantly impact our industry and our business. Many of the provisions of the ACA will phase in over the course of the next several years, and we may be unable to predict accurately what effect the ACA or other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, including amendments to the ACA, will have on our business. In addition, provisions of the ACA may continue to be challenged in the courts.\nIn addition, we are subject to various other laws and regulations, including, among others, the Stark Law relating to self-referrals, anti-kickback laws, antitrust laws and the privacy and data protection laws described below. See \u201cPart I - Item 1. Business - Healthcare Laws and Regulations\u201d for additional information. If we were to become subject to litigation or liabilities under these or other laws, our business could be adversely affected. See \u201cWe may become subject to litigation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\u201d\nAdditionally, the outcomes of upcoming 2016 presidential and congressional elections are uncertain. We cannot predict the impact these elections may have on the ACA and other healthcare laws and regulations, and consequently, on our business.\nWe are subject to privacy and data protection laws governing the transmission, security and privacy of health information, which may impose restrictions on the manner in which we access personal data and subject us to penalties if we are unable to fully comply with such laws.\nAs described below, we are required to comply with numerous federal and state laws and regulations governing the collection, use, disclosure, storage and transmission of individually identifiable health information that we may obtain or have access to in connection with the provision of our services. These laws and regulations, including their interpretation by governmental agencies, are subject to frequent change and could have a negative impact on our business.\n\u2022\nHIPAA expanded protection of the privacy and security of personal health information and required the adoption of standards for the exchange of electronic health information. Among the standards that the Department of Health and Human Services has adopted pursuant to HIPAA are standards for electronic transactions and code sets, unique identifiers for providers, employers,\nhealth plans and individuals, security, electronic signatures, privacy and enforcement. Failure to comply with HIPAA could result in fines and penalties that could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\u2022\nThe Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or the HITECH Act, enacted as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, also known as the \u201cStimulus Bill,\u201d effective February 22, 2010, set forth health information security breach notification requirements and increased penalties for violation of HIPAA. The HITECH Act requires individual notification for all breaches, media notification of breaches for over 500 individuals and at least annual reporting of all breaches to the Department of Health and Human Services. The HITECH Act also replaced the prior penalty system of one tier of penalties of $100 per violation and an annual maximum of $25,000 with a four-tier system of sanctions for breaches. Penalties now range from the original $100 per violation and an annual maximum of $25,000 for the first tier to a minimum of $50,000 per violation and an annual maximum of $1.5 million for the fourth tier. Failure to comply with the HITECH Act could result in fines and penalties that could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\u2022\nNumerous other federal and state laws may apply that restrict the use and protect the privacy and security of individually identifiable information, as well as employee personal information. These include state medical privacy laws, state social security number protection laws and federal and state consumer protection laws. These various laws in many cases are not preempted by HIPAA and may be subject to varying interpretations by the courts and government agencies, creating complex compliance issues for us and our partners and potentially exposing us to additional expense, adverse publicity and liability, any of which could adversely affect our business.\n\u2022\nFederal and state consumer protection laws are increasingly being applied by the FTC and states\u2019 attorneys general to regulate the collection, use, storage and disclosure of personal or individually identifiable information, through websites or otherwise, and to regulate the presentation of website content.\nThere is ongoing concern from privacy advocates, regulators and others regarding data protection and privacy issues, and the number of jurisdictions with data protection and privacy laws have been increasing. Also, there are ongoing public policy discussions regarding whether the standards for de-identified, anonymous or pseudonomized health information are sufficient, and the risk of re-identification sufficiently small, to adequately protect patient privacy. These discussions may lead to further restrictions on the use of such information. There can be no assurance that these initiatives or future initiatives will not adversely affect our ability to access and use data or to develop or market current or future services.\nThe security measures that we and our third-party vendors and subcontractors have in place to ensure compliance with privacy and data protection laws may not protect our facilities and systems from security breaches, acts of vandalism or theft, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and human errors or other similar events. Under the HITECH Act, as a business associate we may also be liable for privacy and security breaches and failures of our subcontractors. Even though we provide for appropriate protections through our agreements with our subcontractors, we still have limited control over their actions and practices. A breach of privacy or security of individually identifiable health information by a subcontractor may result in an enforcement action, including criminal and civil liability, against us. Due to the recent enactment of the HITECH Act, we are not able to predict the extent of the impact such incidents may have on our business. Our failure to comply may result in criminal and civil liability because the potential for enforcement action against business associates is now greater. Enforcement actions against us could be costly and could interrupt regular operations, which may adversely affect our business. While we have not received any notices of violation of the applicable privacy and data protection laws and believe we are in compliance with such laws, there can be no assurance that we will not receive such notices in the future.\nIf we are unable to obtain, maintain and enforce intellectual property protection for our technology and products or if the scope of our intellectual property protection is not sufficiently broad, others may be able to develop and commercialize technology and products substantially similar to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be adversely affected.\nOur business depends on proprietary technology and content, including software, databases, confidential information and know-how, the protection of which is crucial to the success of our business. We rely on a combination of trademark, trade-secret and copyright laws and confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights in our proprietary technology and content. We are pursuing the registration of our trademarks and service marks in the United States. We may, over time, increase our investment in protecting our intellectual property through additional trademark, patent and other intellectual property filings that could be expensive and time-consuming. Effective trademark, trade-secret and copyright protection is expensive to develop and maintain, both in terms of initial and ongoing registration requirements and the costs of defending our rights. These measures, however, may not be sufficient to offer us meaningful protection. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, our competitive position and our business could be harmed, as third parties may be able to commercialize and use technologies and software products that are substantially the same as ours without incurring the development and licensing costs that we have incurred. Any of our owned or licensed intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated, our trade secrets and other confidential information could be disclosed in an unauthorized manner to third parties, or our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide us with competitive advantages, which could result in costly redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain offerings or other competitive harm.\nMonitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and costly. From time to time, we seek to analyze our competitors\u2019 products and services, and may in the future seek to enforce our rights against potential infringement. However, the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property. We may not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights. Any inability to meaningfully protect our intellectual property rights could result in harm to our ability to compete and reduce demand for our technology and products. Moreover, our failure to develop and properly manage new intellectual property could adversely affect our market positions and business opportunities. Also, some of our products and services rely on technologies and software developed by or licensed from third parties, and we may not be able to maintain our relationships with such third parties or enter into similar relationships in the future on reasonable terms or at all.\nWe may also be required to protect our proprietary technology and content in an increasing number of jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and may not be successful, or which we may not pursue in every location. In addition, effective intellectual property protection may not be available to us in every country, and the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the United States. Additional uncertainty may result from changes to intellectual property legislation enacted in the United States and elsewhere, and from interpretations of intellectual property laws by applicable courts and agencies. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to obtain and maintain the intellectual property rights necessary to provide us with a competitive advantage. Our failure to obtain, maintain and enforce our intellectual property rights could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our business may be adversely affected.\nThe registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names that we own or license may be challenged, infringed, circumvented, declared generic, lapsed or determined to be infringing on or dilutive of other marks. We may not be able to protect our rights in these trademarks and trade names, which we need in order to build name recognition with potential partners. In addition, third parties may in the future file for registration of trademarks similar or identical to our trademarks. If they succeed in registering or developing common law rights in such trademarks, and if we are not successful in challenging such third-party rights, we may not be able to use these trademarks to commercialize our technologies or products in certain relevant countries. If we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, we may not be able to compete effectively and our business may be adversely affected.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing or otherwise violating their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur commercial success depends on our ability to develop and commercialize our services and use our proprietary technology without infringing the intellectual property or proprietary rights of third parties. Intellectual property disputes can be costly to defend and may cause our business, operating results and financial condition to suffer. As the market for healthcare in the United States expands and more patents are issued, the risk increases that there may be patents issued to third parties that relate to our products and technology of which we are not aware or that we must challenge to continue our operations as currently contemplated. Whether merited or not, we may face allegations that we, our partners, our licensees or parties indemnified by us have infringed or otherwise violated the patents, trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Such claims may be made by competitors seeking to obtain a competitive advantage or by other parties. Additionally, in recent years, individuals and groups have begun purchasing intellectual property assets for the purpose of making claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from companies like ours. We may also face allegations that our employees have misappropriated the intellectual property or proprietary rights of their former employers or other third parties. It may be necessary for us to initiate litigation to defend ourselves in order to determine the scope, enforceability and validity of third-party intellectual property or proprietary rights, or to establish our respective rights. Regardless of whether claims that we are infringing patents or other intellectual property rights have merit, such claims can be time-consuming, divert management\u2019s attention and financial resources and can be costly to evaluate and defend. Results of any such litigation are difficult to predict and may require us to stop commercializing or using our products or technology, obtain licenses, modify our services and technology while we develop non-infringing substitutes or incur substantial damages, settlement costs or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or providing the affected products and services. If we require a third-party license, it may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, and we may have to pay substantial royalties, upfront fees or grant cross-licenses to intellectual property rights for our products and services. We may also have to redesign our products or services so they do not infringe third-party intellectual property rights, which may not be possible or may require substantial monetary expenditures and time, during which our technology and products may not be available for commercialization or use. Even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold its contractual obligations. If we cannot or do not obtain a third-party license to the infringed technology at all, license the technology on reasonable terms or obtain similar technology from another source, our revenue and earnings could be adversely impacted.\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business with respect to intellectual property. We are not currently subject to any claims from third parties asserting infringement of their intellectual property rights.\nSome third parties may be able to sustain the costs of complex litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. Even if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments, and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our Class A common stock. Moreover, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our operations. Assertions by third parties that we violate their intellectual property rights could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur use of \u201copen source\u201d software could adversely affect our ability to offer our services and subject us to possible litigation.\nWe may use open source software in connection with our products and services. Companies that incorporate open source software into their products have, from time to time, faced claims challenging the use of open source software and/or compliance with open source license terms. As a result, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or claiming noncompliance with open source licensing terms. Some open source software licenses require users who distribute software containing open source software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software and/or make available any derivative works of the open source code, which could include valuable proprietary code of the user, on unfavorable terms or at no cost. While we monitor the use of open source software and try to ensure that none is used in a manner that would require us to disclose our proprietary source code or that would otherwise breach the terms of an open source agreement, such use could inadvertently occur, in part because open source license terms are often ambiguous. Any requirement to disclose our proprietary source code or pay damages for breach of contract could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could help our competitors develop products and services that are similar to or better than ours.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary information, the value of our technology and products could be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to protect our trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary information adequately. Although we use reasonable efforts to protect this proprietary information and technology, our employees, consultants and other parties may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information or technology to competitors. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using any of our proprietary information or technology is expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary information. We rely, in part, on non-disclosure, confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants and other parties to protect our trade secrets, know-how and other intellectual property and proprietary information. These agreements may not be self-executing, or they may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for such breach. Moreover, third parties may independently develop similar or equivalent proprietary information or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary information.\nWe depend on certain technologies that are licensed to us. We do not control the intellectual property rights covering these technologies and any loss of our rights to these technologies or the rights licensed to us could prevent us from developing and/or commercializing our products.\nWe are a party to a number of license agreements under which we are granted rights to intellectual property that is important to our business, and we expect that we may need to enter into additional license agreements in the future. We rely on these licenses to use various proprietary technologies that are material to our business, including without limitation those technologies licensed under an intellectual property and development services license agreement between us and UPMC, or the UPMC IP Agreement, a technology license agreement between us and UPMC, or the UPMC Technology Agreement, and an intellectual property license and data access agreement with The Advisory Board, or The Advisory Board IP Agreement. Under the UPMC IP Agreement, certain of UPMC\u2019s proprietary analytics models and know-how are licensed to us on a non-exclusive basis from UPMC; pursuant to the UPMC Technology Agreement, UPMC\u2019s proprietary technology platform, associated know-how and the Identifi\u00ae trademark are licensed to us on an irrevocable, non-exclusive basis from UPMC; in each case, subject to certain ongoing territorial, time and use restrictions. Under The Advisory Board IP Agreement, we hold a license to use a business plan and operating model designed by The Advisory Board, a right to access certain analysis, data and proprietary information of The Advisory Board, we obtain a membership in The Advisory Board\u2019s healthcare industry program, and the right to access key Advisory Board personnel and assistance in our promotion and sales efforts. Our rights to use these technologies and know-how and employ the software claimed in the licensed technologies are subject to the continuation of and our compliance with the terms of those licenses. Our existing license agreements impose, and we expect that future license agreements will impose on us, various exclusivity obligations. If we fail to comply with our obligations under these agreements, the applicable licensor may have the right to terminate our license, in which case we may not be able to develop or commercialize the products or technologies covered by the license.\nDisputes may arise between us and our licensors regarding intellectual property rights subject to a license agreement, including:\n\u2022\nthe scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues;\n\u2022\nwhether and the extent to which our technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the license agreement;\n\u2022\nour obligations with respect to the use of the licensed technology in relation to our services and technologies, and which activities satisfy those obligations;\n\u2022\nwhether our activities are in compliance with the restrictions placed upon our rights to use the licensed technology by our licensors; and\n\u2022\nthe ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our licensors and us and our partners.\nIf disputes over intellectual property rights that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected products and technologies.\nThe risks described elsewhere pertaining to our intellectual property rights also apply to the intellectual property rights that we license, and any failure by us or our licensors to obtain, maintain and enforce these rights could have a material adverse effect on our business. In some cases, we do not have control over the prosecution, maintenance or enforcement of the intellectual property rights that we license, and may not have sufficient ability to consult and input into the prosecution and maintenance process with respect to such intellectual property, and our licensors may fail to take the steps we feel are necessary or desirable in order to obtain, maintain and enforce the licensed intellectual property rights and, as a result, our ability to retain our competitive advantage with respect to our products and technologies may be materially affected.\nAny restrictions on our use of, or ability to license, data, or our failure to license data and integrate third-party technologies, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend upon licenses from third parties for some of the technology and data used in our applications, and for some of the technology platforms upon which these applications are built and operate, including under the UPMC IP Agreement, the UPMC Technology Agreement and The Advisory Board IP Agreement. We expect that we may need to obtain additional licenses from third parties in the future in connection with the development of our products and services. In addition, we obtain a portion of the data that we use from government entities, public records and from our partners for specific partner engagements. We believe that we have all rights necessary to use the data that is incorporated into our products and services. However, we cannot assure you that our licenses for information will allow us to use that information for all potential or contemplated applications and products. In addition, certain of our products depend on maintaining our data and analytics platform, which is populated with data disclosed to us by our partners with their consent. If these partners revoke their consent for us to maintain, use, de-identify and share this data, consistent with applicable law, our data assets could be degraded.\nIn the future, data providers could withdraw their data from us or restrict our usage for any reason, including if there is a competitive reason to do so, if legislation is passed restricting the use of the data or if judicial interpretations are issued restricting use of the data that we currently use in our products and services. In addition, data providers could fail to adhere to our quality control standards in the future, causing us to incur additional expense to appropriately utilize the data. If a substantial number of data providers were to withdraw or restrict their data, or if they fail to adhere to our quality control standards, and if we are unable to identify and contract with suitable alternative data suppliers and integrate these data sources into our service offerings, our ability to provide products and services to our partners would be materially adversely impacted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe also integrate into our proprietary applications and use third-party software to maintain and enhance, among other things, content generation and delivery, and to support our technology infrastructure. Some of this software is proprietary and some is open source software. Our use of third-party technologies exposes us to increased risks, including, but not limited to, risks associated with the integration of new technology into our solutions, the diversion of our resources from development of our own proprietary technology and our inability to generate revenue from licensed technology sufficient to offset associated acquisition and maintenance costs. These technologies may not be available to us in the future on commercially reasonable terms or at all and could be difficult to replace once integrated into our own proprietary applications. Most of these licenses can be renewed only by mutual consent and may be terminated if we breach the terms of the license and fail to cure the breach within a specified period of time. Our inability to obtain, maintain or comply with any of these licenses could delay development until equivalent technology can be identified, licensed and integrated, which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMost of our third-party licenses are non-exclusive and our competitors may obtain the right to use any of the technology covered by these licenses to compete directly with us. Our use of third-party technologies exposes us to increased risks, including, but not limited to, risks associated with the integration of new technology into our solutions, the diversion of our resources from development of our own proprietary technology and our inability to generate revenue from licensed technology sufficient to offset associated acquisition and maintenance costs. In addition, if our data suppliers choose to discontinue support of the licensed technology in the future, we might not be able to modify or adapt our own solutions.\nData loss or corruption due to failures or errors in our systems or service disruptions at our data centers may adversely affect our reputation and relationships with existing partners, which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause of the large amount of data that we collect and manage, it is possible that hardware failures or errors in our systems could result in data loss or corruption or cause the information that we collect to be incomplete or contain inaccuracies that our partners regard as significant. Complex software such as ours may contain errors or failures that are not detected until after the software is introduced or updates and new versions are released. We continually introduce new software and updates and enhancements to our existing software. Despite testing by us, we may discover defects or errors in our software. Any defects or errors could expose us to risk of liability to partners and the government and could cause delays in the introduction of new products and services, result in increased costs and diversion of development resources, require design modifications, decrease market acceptance or partner satisfaction with our products and services or cause harm to our reputation.\nFurthermore, our partners might use our software together with products from other companies. As a result, when problems occur, it might be difficult to identify the source of the problem. Even when our software does not cause these problems, the existence of these errors might cause us to incur significant costs, divert the attention of our technical personnel from our product development efforts, impact our reputation and lead to significant partner relations problems.\nOur business is subject to online security risks, and if we are unable to safeguard the security and privacy of confidential data, our reputation and business will be harmed.\nOur services involve the collection, storage and analysis of confidential information. In certain cases such information is provided to third parties, for example, to the service providers who provide hosting services for our technology platform, and we may be unable to control the use of such information or the security protections employed by such third parties. We may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches. Despite our implementation of security measures, techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to information or to sabotage information technology systems change frequently. As a result, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any compromise or perceived compromise of our security (or the security of our third-party service providers who have access to confidential information) could damage our reputation and our relationship with our partners, could reduce demand for our products and services and could subject us to significant liability as well as regulatory action. In addition, in the event that new data security laws are implemented, we may not be able to timely comply with such requirements, or such requirements may not be compatible with our current processes. Changing our processes could be time consuming and expensive, and failure to timely implement required changes could subject us to liability for non-compliance.\nWe rely on Internet infrastructure, bandwidth providers, data center providers, other third parties and our own systems for providing services to our partners, and any failure or interruption in the services provided by these third parties or our own systems could expose us to litigation and negatively impact our relationships with partners, adversely affecting our brand and our business.\nOur ability to deliver our products and services, particularly our cloud-based solutions, is dependent on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the Internet and other telecommunications services by third parties. This includes maintenance of a reliable network connection with the necessary speed, data capacity and security for providing reliable Internet access and services and reliable telephone and facsimile services. Our services are designed to operate without interruption in accordance with our service level commitments.\nHowever, we have experienced limited interruptions in these systems in the past, including server failures that temporarily slow down the performance of our services, and we may experience more significant interruptions in the future. We rely on internal systems as well as third-party suppliers, including bandwidth and telecommunications equipment providers, to provide our services. We do not maintain redundant systems or facilities for some of these services. Interruptions in these systems, whether due to system failures, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins or other catastrophic events, could affect the security or availability of our services and prevent or inhibit the ability of our partners to access our services. In the event of a catastrophic event with respect to one or more of these systems or facilities, we may experience an extended period of system unavailability, which could result in substantial costs to remedy those problems or negatively impact our relationship with our partners, our business, results of operations and financial condition. To operate without interruption, both we and our service providers must guard against:\n\u2022\ndamage from fire, power loss and other natural disasters;\n\u2022\ntelecommunications failures;\n\u2022\nsoftware and hardware errors, failures and crashes;\n\u2022\nsecurity breaches, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems; and\n\u2022\nother potential interruptions.\nAny disruption in the network access, telecommunications or co-location services provided by third-party providers or any failure of or by third-party providers\u2019 systems or our own systems to handle current or higher volume of use could significantly harm our business. We exercise limited control over our third-party suppliers, which increases our vulnerability to problems with services they provide. Any errors, failures, interruptions or delays experienced in connection with these third-party technologies and information services or our own systems could negatively impact our relationships with partners and adversely affect our business and could expose us to third-party liabilities. Although we maintain insurance for our business, the coverage under our policies may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at an acceptable cost.\nThe reliability and performance of our Internet connection may be harmed by increased usage or by denial-of-service attacks. The Internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damages to portions of its infrastructure, and it could face outages and delays in the future. These outages and delays could reduce the level of Internet usage as well as the availability of the Internet to us for delivery of our Internet-based services.\nWe rely on third-party vendors to host and maintain our technology platform.\nWe rely on third-party vendors to host and maintain our technology platform, including Identifi\u00ae. Our ability to offer our services and operate our business is therefore dependent on maintaining our relationships with third-party vendors, particularly UPMC, and entering into new relationships to meet the changing needs of our business. Any deterioration in our relationships with such vendors or our failure to enter into agreements with vendors in the future could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Despite precautions taken at our vendors\u2019 facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. These service interruption events could cause our platform to be unavailable to our partners and impair our ability to deliver services and to manage our relationships with new and existing partners, which in turn could materially affect our results of operations.\nIf our vendors are unable or unwilling to provide the services necessary to support our business, or if our agreements with such vendors are terminated, our operations could be significantly disrupted. Two of our vendor agreements may be unilaterally terminated by the licensor for convenience, and if such agreements are terminated, we may not be able to enter into similar relationships in the future on reasonable terms or at all. We may also incur substantial costs, delays and disruptions to our business in transitioning such services to ourselves or other third-party vendors. In addition, third-party vendors may not be able to provide the services required in order to meet the changing needs of our business.\nWe depend on our senior management team, and the loss of one or more of our executive officers or key employees or an inability to attract and retain highly skilled employees could adversely affect our business.\nOur success depends largely upon the continued services of our key executive officers. From time to time, there may be changes in our senior management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives, which could disrupt our business. The replacement of one or more of our executive officers or other key employees would likely involve significant time and costs and may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives.\nIn addition, competition for qualified management in our industry is intense. Many of the companies with which we compete for management personnel have greater financial and other resources than we do. We have not entered into employment agreements with our executive officers. All of our employees are \u201cat-will\u201d employees, and their employment can be terminated by us or them at any time, for any reason and without notice and without the payment of any severance. The departure of key personnel could adversely affect the conduct of our business. In such event, we would be required to hire other personnel to manage and operate our business, and there can be no assurance that we would be able to employ a suitable replacement for the departing individual, or that a replacement could be hired on terms that are favorable to us. In addition, volatility or lack of performance in our stock price may affect our ability to attract replacements should key personnel depart. If we are not able to retain any of our key management personnel, our business could be harmed.\nWe may make future acquisitions and investments which may be difficult to integrate, divert management resources, result in unanticipated costs or dilute our stockholders.\nPart of our business strategy is to acquire or invest in companies, products or technologies that complement our current products and services, enhance our market coverage or technical capabilities or offer growth opportunities. As an example, in February 2016 we entered into a strategic alliance with a leading nonprofit community-based and provider-sponsored health plan administering Kentucky Medicaid and federal Medicare Advantage benefits. Future acquisitions and investments could pose numerous risks to our operations, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulty integrating the purchased operations, products or technologies;\n\u2022\nsubstantial unanticipated integration costs;\n\u2022\nassimilation of the acquired businesses, which may divert significant management attention and financial resources from our other operations and could disrupt our ongoing business;\n\u2022\nthe loss of key employees, particularly those of the acquired operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulty retaining or developing the acquired business\u2019 customers;\n\u2022\nadverse effects on our existing business relationships;\n\u2022\nfailure to realize the potential cost savings or other financial benefits or the strategic benefits of the acquisitions, including failure to consummate any proposed or contemplated transaction; and\n\u2022\nliabilities from the acquired businesses for infringement of intellectual property rights or other claims and failure to obtain indemnification for such liabilities or claims.\nIn connection with these acquisitions or investments, we could incur debt, amortization expenses related to intangible assets or large and immediate write-offs, assume liabilities or issue stock that would dilute our current stockholders\u2019 ownership. We may be unable to complete acquisitions or integrate the operations, products or personnel gained through any such acquisition without a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have recorded a significant amount of goodwill, and we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets, causing us to record impairments that may negatively affect our results of operations.\nOur total assets include substantial goodwill. At December 31, 2015, we had $608.9 million of goodwill on our Consolidated Balance Sheet associated with the Offering Reorganization. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price, plus the fair value of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but is reviewed at least annually for indications of impairment, with consideration given to financial performance and other relevant factors. In the future, we may be required to recognize an impairment of goodwill due to market conditions or other factors related to our performance.\nWhile our annual goodwill impairment test is conducted at October 31, 2015, we have processes to monitor for interim triggering events. Under GAAP, we review our goodwill for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill may not be recoverable include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, our overall financial performance including an analysis of our current and projected cash flows, revenue and earnings, a sustained decrease in our share price and other relevant entity-specific events including changes in strategy, customers or litigation. A detailed discussion of our impairment testing is included in \u201cPart II - Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies.\u201d\nAs a result of the Offering Reorganization, we revalued our consolidated balance sheet to the market value of our IPO Class A Common Stock price of $17.00. Subsequent to December 31, 2015, our share price has remained below the IPO price. If a sustained decrease in the price of our Class A Common Stock continues, we may be required to write down a portion of our $608.9 million of goodwill and record a charge in impairment of goodwill for the relevant periods. For example, the closing price of our Class A common stock on the NYSE on February 25, 2016, was $8.71. If our Class A common stock price remains at a similar level through the first quarter of 2016, we will be required to write down a portion of our goodwill and record an impairment charge. Any impairment charges that we record in the future could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may need to obtain additional financing which may not be available or, if it is available, may result in a reduction in the ownership of our stockholders.\nWe may need to raise additional funds in order to:\n\u2022\nfinance unanticipated working capital requirements;\n\u2022\ndevelop or enhance our technological infrastructure and our existing products and services;\n\u2022\nfund strategic relationships, including joint ventures and co-investments;\n\u2022\nfund additional implementation engagements;\n\u2022\nrespond to competitive pressures; and\n\u2022\nacquire complementary businesses, technologies, products or services.\nAdditional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are unavailable or are unavailable on acceptable terms, our ability to fund our expansion strategy, take advantage of unanticipated opportunities, develop or enhance technology or services or otherwise respond to competitive pressures could be significantly limited. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership of our then-existing stockholders may be reduced, and holders of these securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our then-existing stockholders. In addition, any indebtedness we incur and restrictive covenants contained in the agreements related thereto could:\n\u2022\nmake it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations, including interest payments on any debt obligations;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing to operate our business;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our debt, reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund capital expenditures and working capital and other general operational requirements;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility to plan for and react to changes in our business and the healthcare industry;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to pursue acquisitions; and\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including changes in interest rates or a downturn in our business or the economy.\nThe occurrence of any one of these events could cause a significant decrease in our liquidity and impair our ability to pay amounts due on any indebtedness, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have experienced net losses in the past and we may not achieve profitability in the future.\nWe have incurred significant net losses in the past and we anticipate that our operating expenses will increase substantially in the foreseeable future as we continue to invest to grow our business and build relationships with partners, develop our platform, develop new solutions and comply with being a public company. These efforts may prove to be more expensive than we currently anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenue sufficiently to offset these higher expenses. In addition, to the extent we are successful in increasing our partner base, we could incur increased losses because significant costs associated with entering into partner agreements are generally incurred up front, while revenue is generally recognized each period in proportion to the amount of the contract completed during that period. As a result, we may need to raise additional capital through equity and debt financings in order to fund our operations. We may also fail to improve the gross margins of our business. If we are unable to effectively manage these risks and difficulties as we encounter them, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and distract our management, which could make it difficult to manage our business, particularly after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d\nAs a public company, we are required to comply with various regulatory and reporting requirements, including those required by the SEC. Complying with these reporting and other regulatory requirements is time-consuming and will continue to result in increased costs to us and could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. These requirements may place a strain on our systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. To maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, we may need to commit significant resources, hire additional staff and provide additional management oversight. We have been and will be continuing to implement additional procedures and processes for the purpose of addressing the standards and requirements applicable to public companies. Sustaining our growth as a public company also requires us to commit additional management, operational and financial resources to identify new professionals to join our company and to maintain appropriate operational and financial systems to adequately support expansion. These activities may divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, we are taking, and may continue to take, advantage of certain temporary exemptions from various reporting requirements, including, but not limited to, a delay in the timeframe required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements.\nWhen these exemptions cease to apply, we expect to incur additional expenses and devote increased management effort toward ensuring compliance with them. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may continue to incur as a result of becoming a public company or the timing of such costs.\nOur adjusted results may not be representative of our future performance.\nIn preparing the adjusted results included in our MD&A in this Form 10-K, we have made adjustments to our historical financial information to reflect the Offering Reorganization as if it had occurred on the first day of the relevant period and we have adjusted the results to exclude the impact of purchase accounting adjustments, stock-based compensation expenses and transaction expenses related to the Offering Reorganization and IPO. These adjusted measures do not represent and should not be considered as alternatives to GAAP measurements, and our calculations thereof may not be comparable to similarly entitled measures reported by other companies. See \u201cPart II - Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for additional information.\nWe may become subject to litigation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may become subject to litigation in the future. Some of these claims may result in significant defense costs and potentially significant judgments against us, some of which we are not, or cannot be, insured against. We generally intend to defend ourselves vigorously; however, we cannot be certain of the ultimate outcomes of any claims that may arise in the future. Resolution of these types of matters against us may result in our having to pay significant fines, judgments or settlements, which, if uninsured, or if the fines, judgments and settlements exceed insured levels, could adversely impact our earnings and cash flows, thereby having a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our Class A common stock. Certain litigation or the resolution of certain litigation may affect the availability or cost of some of our insurance coverage, which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows, expose us to increased risks that would be uninsured and adversely impact our ability to attract directors and officers.\nRisks Relating to Our Structure\nWe are a holding company and our only material asset is our interest in Evolent Health LLC and, accordingly, we are dependent upon distributions from Evolent Health LLC to pay taxes and other expenses.\nWe are a holding company and have no material assets other than our ownership of Class A common units of Evolent Health LLC. We have no independent means of generating revenue. Evolent Health LLC is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, is not itself subject to U.S. federal income tax. Instead, its net taxable income is generally allocated to its members, including us, pro rata according to the number of common units each member owns. Accordingly, we incur income taxes on our allocable share of any net taxable income of Evolent Health LLC and also incur expenses related to our operations. We intend to continue to cause Evolent Health LLC to distribute cash to its members, including us, in an amount sufficient to cover all of our tax liabilities and dividends, if any, declared by us, as well as any payments due under the TRA, as described in \u201cPart II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 11 - Tax Receivables Agreement.\u201d To the extent that we need funds to pay our tax or other liabilities or to fund our operations, and Evolent Health LLC is restricted from making distributions to us under applicable agreements, laws or regulations or does not have sufficient cash to make these distributions, we may have to borrow funds to meet these obligations and operate our business, and our liquidity and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. To the extent that we are unable to make payments under the TRA for any reason, such payments will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid.\nWe are required to pay certain of our pre-IPO investors for certain tax benefits we may claim in the future, and these amounts are expected to be material.\nThe Class B common units held upon completion of the transactions described in \u201cPart II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4 - The Offering Reorganization\u201d may in the future be exchanged (together with an equal number of shares of our Class B common stock) for shares of our Class A common stock. The exchanges may result in increases in the tax basis of the assets of Evolent Health LLC that otherwise would not have been available. In addition, we expect that certain NOLs will be available to us as a result of the transactions as described in \u201cTax Receivables Agreement\u201d in \u201cPart II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 11.\u201d These increases in tax basis and NOLs may reduce the amount of tax that we would otherwise be required to pay in the future, although the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d), may challenge all or a part of the tax basis increases and NOLs, and a court could sustain such a challenge.\nWe have entered into a TRA related to the tax basis step-up of the assets of Evolent Health LLC and certain NOLs of the former members of Evolent Health LLC, with the holders of Class B common units and certain of our other investors. Pursuant to the TRA, we will pay them 85% of the amount of the cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local and foreign income tax that we realize as a result of possible increases in tax basis resulting from our exchanges of Class B common units (calculated assuming that any post-IPO transfer of Class B common units (other than the exchanges) had not occurred) as well as certain other benefits attributable to payments under the TRA itself.\nThe TRA also requires us to pay 85% of the amount of the cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local and foreign income tax that we realize as a result of the utilization of the NOLs of Evolent Health Holdings and an affiliate of TPG attributable to periods prior to our IPO and the deduction of any imputed interest attributable to our payment obligations under the TRA. The payments that we make under the TRA could be substantial.\nWe will not be reimbursed for any payments made under the TRA in the event that any tax benefits are disallowed.\nIf the IRS successfully challenges the tax basis increases or the existence or amount of the NOLs at any point in the future after payments are made under the TRA, we will not be reimbursed for any payments made under the applicable TRA (although future payments under the TRA, if any, would be netted against any unreimbursed payments to reflect the result of any such successful challenge by the IRS). As a result, in certain circumstances, we could be required to make payments under the TRA in excess of our cash tax savings.\nWe may not be able to realize all or a portion of the tax benefits that are currently expected to result from future exchanges of Class B common units for our Class A common stock, the utilization of certain tax attributes previously held by Evolent Health Holdings and an affiliate of TPG and from payments made under the TRA.\nOur ability to realize the tax benefits that we currently expect to be available as a result of the increases in tax basis created by any future exchanges of Class B common units (together with an equal number of shares of our Class B common stock) for our Class A common stock and by the payments made pursuant to the TRA, and our ability to utilize the pre-IPO NOLs of Evolent Health Holdings and an affiliate of TPG and the interest deductions imputed under the TRA all depend on a number of assumptions, including that we earn sufficient taxable income each year during the period over which such deductions are available and that there are no adverse changes in applicable law or regulations. If our actual taxable income were insufficient or there were adverse changes in applicable law or regulations, we may be unable to realize all or a portion of these expected benefits and our cash flows and stockholders\u2019 equity could be negatively affected. Please refer to the discussion of in \u201cPart II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 11 - Tax Receivables Agreement\u201d for additional information.\nIn certain circumstances, Evolent Health LLC will be required to make distributions to us and the other members of Evolent Health LLC and the distributions that Evolent Health LLC will be required to make may be substantial.\nEvolent Health LLC is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, is not subject to U.S. federal income tax. Instead, taxable income is allocated to its members, including us. We intend to cause Evolent Health LLC to make pro rata cash distributions, or tax distributions, to its members in an amount sufficient to allow each member to pay taxes on such member\u2019s allocable share of the net taxable income of Evolent Health LLC. Funds used by Evolent Health LLC to satisfy its tax distribution obligations will not be available for reinvestment in our business. Moreover, these tax distributions may be substantial, and will likely exceed (as a percentage of Evolent Health LLC\u2019s income) the overall effective tax rate applicable to a similarly situated corporate taxpayer. As a result of the potential differences in the amount of net taxable income allocable to us and the Class B common unit holders, it is possible that we will receive distributions significantly in excess of our tax liabilities and obligations to make payments under the TRA. To the extent we do not distribute such cash balances as dividends on our Class A common stock and instead, for example, hold such cash balances or lend them to Evolent Health LLC, the Class B common unit holders would benefit from any value attributable to such accumulated cash balances as a result of its ownership of Class A common stock following an exchange of its Class B common units in Evolent Health LLC (including any exchange upon an acquisition of us). See \u201cPart II - Item 5. Market for Registrant\u2019s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities - Dividends\u201d for a discussion of our dividend policy.\nIn certain cases, payments by us under the TRA may be accelerated or significantly exceed the tax benefits we realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the TRA.\nThe TRA provides that upon certain changes of control, or if, at any time, we elect an early termination of the TRA or are in material breach of our obligations under the TRA, we would be required to make an immediate payment equal to the present value of the anticipated future tax benefits to the holders of Class B common units, the former stockholders of Evolent Health Holdings and the former stockholders of an affiliate of TPG. Such payment would be based on certain valuation assumptions and deemed events set forth in the TRA, including the assumption that we have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize such tax benefits. The benefits would be payable even though, in certain circumstances, no Class B common units are actually exchanged and no NOLs are actually used at the time of the accelerated payment under the TRA, thereby resulting in no corresponding tax basis step up at the time of such accelerated payment under the TRA. Accordingly, payments under the TRA may be made years in advance of the actual realization, if any, of the anticipated future tax benefits and may be significantly greater than the benefits we realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the TRA. In these situations, our obligations under the TRA could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity. We may not be able to finance our obligations under the TRA and any indebtedness we incur may limit our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to make distributions to us to pay these obligations. In addition, our obligations under the TRA could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes of control that could be in the best interests of holders of our Class A common stock.\nDifferent interests among our investors or between our investors and us, including with respect to related party transactions, could prevent us from achieving our business goals.\nFor the foreseeable future, we expect that a majority of our board of directors will include directors who are affiliated with entities that may have commercial relationships with us. Certain of our pre-IPO investors could have business interests that conflict with those of the other investors, which may make it difficult for us to pursue strategic initiatives that require consensus among our owners.\nOur relationship with our pre-IPO investors, who owned 56.6% of our Class A common stock, 100% of our Class B common stock and a 29.7% economic interest in Evolent Health LLC, as of December 31, 2015, could create conflicts of interest among our investors, or between our investors and us, in a number of areas relating to our past and ongoing relationships. For example, certain of our products and services compete (or may compete in the future) with various products and services of our investors. In addition, our pre-IPO investors may have different tax positions from us which could influence their decisions regarding whether and when to\ndispose of assets, whether and when to incur new or refinance existing indebtedness, especially in light of the existence of the TRA, and whether and when Evolent Health, Inc. should terminate the TRA and accelerate its obligations thereunder. In addition, the structuring of future transactions may take into consideration these pre-IPO investors\u2019 tax or other considerations even where no similar benefit would accrue to us. Except as set forth in the TRA and the stockholders\u2019 agreement that we entered into with our pre-IPO investors at the time of our IPO, which we refer to as the stockholders\u2019 agreement, there are not any formal dispute resolution procedures in place to resolve conflicts between us and our pre-IPO investors or among our pre-IPO investors. We may not be able to resolve any potential conflicts between us and a pre-IPO investor and, even if we do, the resolution may be less favorable to us than if we were negotiating with an unaffiliated party.\nThe agreements between us and certain of our pre-IPO investors were made in the context of an affiliated relationship and may contain different terms than comparable agreements with unaffiliated third parties.\nThe contractual agreements that we have with certain of our pre-IPO investors were negotiated in the context of an affiliated relationship in which representatives of such pre-IPO investors and their affiliates comprised a significant portion of our board of directors. As a result, the financial provisions, and the other terms of these agreements, such as covenants, contractual obligations on our part and on the part of such pre-IPO investors and termination and default provisions may be less favorable to us than terms that we might have obtained in negotiations with unaffiliated third parties in similar circumstances, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NYSE rules and, as a result, we are exempt from certain corporate governance requirements. You will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements.\nCertain investors who are party to a stockholders\u2019 agreement own a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. Accordingly, we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under the NYSE rules. Under these rules, a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including the requirements that, within one year of the date of listing of our Class A common stock:\n\u2022\nwe have a board that is composed of a majority of \u201cindependent directors\u201d as defined under the NYSE rules; and\n\u2022\nwe have a compensation committee and a nominating and corporate governance committee that are composed of independent directors.\nWe are taking advantage of these exemptions. Accordingly, our stockholders do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the NYSE\u2019s corporate governance requirements.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nWe expect that our stock price will be volatile and may fluctuate or decline significantly.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock is likely to be volatile and subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors, including:\n\u2022\nmarket conditions in the broader stock market in general, or in our industry in particular;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial reports and results of operations;\n\u2022\nour ability to satisfy our ongoing capital needs and unanticipated cash requirements;\n\u2022\nindebtedness incurred in the future;\n\u2022\nintroduction of new products and services by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nissuance of new or changed securities analysts\u2019 reports or recommendations;\n\u2022\nsales of large blocks of our stock;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments;\n\u2022\nlitigation and governmental investigations; and\n\u2022\neconomic and political conditions or events.\nThese and other factors may cause the market price and demand for our Class A common stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of Class A common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our Class A common stock. In addition, in the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. If any of our stockholders brought a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit. Such a lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management from our business.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock will also be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. As a new public company, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrades our stock, or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nIf a substantial number of shares become available for sale and are sold in a short period of time, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline.\nIf our existing stockholders sell substantial amounts of our Class A common stock in the public market, the market price of our Class A common stock could decrease significantly. The perception in the public market that our existing stockholders might sell shares of Class A common stock could also depress our market price. As of December 31, 2015, there were 41,491,498 shares of Class A common stock outstanding. In addition, 1,697,450 options that are held by our employees are currently exercisable or will be exercisable in 2016. Certain of our executive officers, directors and employees are subject to the holding period requirements of Rule 144. After the holding periods have elapsed and, in the case of restricted stock, after the shares have vested, additional shares will be eligible for sale in the public market. The market price of shares of our Class A common stock may drop significantly when the restrictions on resale by our existing stockholders lapse. A decline in the price of shares of our Class A common stock might impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of our Class A common stock or other equity securities.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock could decline due to the large number of shares of Class A common stock eligible for future sale upon the exchange of Class B common units.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our Class A common stock eligible for future sale upon the exchange of Class B common units (together with an equal number of shares of our Class B common stock), or the perception that such sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, may also make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital by selling equity securities in the future, at a time and price that we deem appropriate.\nAs of December 31, 2015, 41,491,498 Class A common units and 17,524,596 Class B common units of Evolent Health LLC were outstanding. Each Class B common unit, together with one share of our Class B common stock, are exchangeable for one share of Class A common stock.\u201d Pursuant to a registration rights agreement, we have granted registration rights to the holders of the Class B common units with respect to their shares of Class A common stock delivered in exchange for their Class B common units, as well as certain other holders of our Class A common stock. See \u201cPart II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4 - Issuances of Common Units\u201d for additional information.\nSome provisions of Delaware law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and certain of our contracts may deter third parties from acquiring us.\nAmong other things, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws:\n\u2022\ndivides our board of directors into three staggered classes of directors that are each elected to three-year terms;\n\u2022\nprohibits stockholder action by written consent after the date on which TPG, The Advisory Board and UPMC cease to collectively own at least a majority in voting power of shares of our common stock;\n\u2022\nauthorizes the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares of capital stock, making a takeover more difficult and expensive;\n\u2022\nprohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022\nprovides that special meetings of the stockholders may be called only by or at the direction of the board of directors, the chairman of our board, the chief executive officer or, so long as TPG, The Advisory Board and UPMC collectively own at least a majority in voting power of shares of our common stock, any such stockholder, subject to certain limitations;\n\u2022\nrequires advance notice to be given by stockholders for any stockholder proposals or director nominees;\n\u2022\nafter the date on which TPG, The Advisory Board and UPMC cease to collectively own at least a majority in voting power of shares of our common stock, requires the affirmative vote of holders of at least 75% of the voting power of our outstanding shares of stock to amend certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and any provision of our amended and restated bylaws; and\n\u2022\nafter the date on which TPG, The Advisory Board and UPMC cease to collectively own at least a majority in voting power of shares of our common stock, requires the affirmative vote of holders of at least 75% of the voting power of our outstanding shares of stock to remove directors and only for cause.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the DGCL may affect the ability of an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d to engage in certain business combinations, for a period of three years following the time that the stockholder becomes an \u201cinterested stockholder.\u201d We have elected in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation not to be subject to Section 203 of the DGCL. Nevertheless, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains provisions that have the same effect as Section 203 of the DGCL, except that they will\nprovide that each of TPG, UPMC and The Advisory Board and their transferees will not be deemed to be \u201cinterested stockholders,\u201d and accordingly are not subject to such restrictions.\nThese and other provisions could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a transaction involving a change in control of our company or could make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing or to cause us to take other corporate actions that they desire. Provisions in certain of our contracts may also deter third parties from acquiring us. For example, under the UPMC IP Agreement, Evolent Health LLC\u2019s license to certain intellectual property of UPMC would cease if we are acquired by certain specified acquirers. In addition, our contracts with certain partners would terminate if we are acquired by certain competitors or if UPMC ceases to be a subcontractor of our data and technology services.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and stockholders\u2019 agreement contain provisions renouncing our interest and expectation to participate in certain corporate opportunities identified by or presented to certain of our pre-IPO investors.\nEach of TPG, The Advisory Board and UPMC and their respective affiliates may engage in activities similar to ours or lines of business or have an interest in the same areas of corporate opportunities as we do. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and stockholders\u2019 agreement provide that such stockholders and their respective affiliates do not have any duty to refrain from (1) engaging, directly or indirectly, in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us, including those business activities or lines of business deemed to be competing with us, or (2) doing business with any of our clients, customers or vendors. In the event that TPG, The Advisory Board or UPMC or any of their respective affiliates acquires knowledge of a potential business opportunity which may be a corporate opportunity for us, they have no duty to communicate or offer such corporate opportunity to us. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and stockholders\u2019 agreement also provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, none of such stockholders or their respective affiliates will be liable to us, for breach of any fiduciary duty or otherwise, by reason of the fact that any such stockholder or any of its affiliates directs such corporate opportunity to another person, or otherwise does not communicate information regarding such corporate opportunity to us, and we have waived and renounced any claim that such business opportunity constituted a corporate opportunity that should have been presented to us. These potential conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects if attractive business opportunities are allocated by TPG, The Advisory Board or UPMC to themselves or their respective affiliates instead of to us.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates courts in the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, subject to limited exceptions, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (b) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (c) any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws, (d) any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws or (e) any other action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. We refer to each of these proceedings as a covered proceeding. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that if any action the subject matter of which is a covered proceeding is filed in a court other than the specified Delaware courts without the approval of our board of directors, which we refer to as a foreign action, the claiming party will be deemed to have consented to (1) the personal jurisdiction of the specified Delaware courts in connection with any action brought in any such courts to enforce the exclusive forum provision described above and (2) having service of process made upon such claiming party in any such enforcement action by service upon such claiming party\u2019s counsel in the foreign action as agent for such claiming party. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also provides that, except to the extent prohibited by the DGCL, in the event that a claiming party initiates, asserts, joins, offers substantial assistance to or has a direct financial interest in any foreign action without the prior approval of our board of directors, each such claiming party will be obligated jointly and severally to reimburse us and any officer, director or other employee made a party to such proceeding for all fees, costs and expenses of every kind and description (including, but not limited to, all attorneys\u2019 fees and other litigation expenses) that the parties may incur in connection with such foreign action. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to these provisions. These provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, for the foreseeable future to fund the development and growth of our business. We do not intend to pay any dividends to holders of our Class A common stock. As a result, capital appreciation in the price of our Class A common stock, if any, will be your only source of gain on an investment in our Class A common stock. See \u201cPart II - Item 5. Market for Registrant\u2019s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities - \u201cDividends\u201d for a discussion of our dividend policy.\nIn preparation of our IPO, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, and if we are unable to remedy our material weakness, or if we fail to establish and maintain effective internal controls, we may be unable to produce timely and accurate financial statements, and we may conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective, which could adversely impact our investors\u2019 confidence and our stock price.\nPrior to the completion of our IPO, we were a private company and had limited accounting personnel to fully execute our accounting processes and address our internal control over financial reporting. Upon becoming a publicly-traded company, we became required to comply with the SEC\u2019s rules implementing Section 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which require management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of controls over financial reporting. We will not be required to make our first annual assessment of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 until the filing of our 2016 10-K. Pursuant to the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until the earlier of (1) the year in which our public float exceeds $700 million as of June 30 of the respective year or (2) December 31, 2020.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. During the course of preparing for our IPO, we determined that we had a material weakness in the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weakness that we identified was that we did not maintain a sufficient complement of resources with an appropriate level of accounting knowledge, experience and training to address accounting for complex, non-routine transactions.\nWe are currently in the process of remediating the material weakness and have taken numerous steps that we believe have addressed certain underlying causes of the material weakness, primarily through the hiring of additional accounting and finance personnel with technical accounting and financial reporting experience, enhancing our training programs within our accounting and finance department and enhancing our internal review procedures during the financial statement close process. This initiative will place significant demands on our financial and operational resources, as well as our IT systems. Our current efforts to design and implement an effective control environment may not be sufficient to remediate or prevent future material weaknesses or significant deficiencies from occurring. During the course of the design and implementation, we may identify additional control deficiencies, which could give rise to other material weaknesses, in addition to the material weakness described above. The material weakness described above or any newly identified material weakness could result in a misstatement of our financial statements or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and all instances of fraud will be detected. If we fail to effectively remediate deficiencies in our control environment, if we identify future material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting or if we are unable to comply with the demands that will be placed upon us as a public company, including the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, in a timely manner, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results, or report them within the timeframes required by the SEC. In addition, if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting are effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, if and when required, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our Class A common stock could be negatively affected. We also could become subject to investigations by the NYSE, the SEC or other regulatory authorities.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our Class A common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we are taking and intend to continue to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which may increase the risk that weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting go undetected. During the course of preparing for our IPO, we concluded that we had a material weakness in the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We also are taking and intend to continue to take advantage of reduced\ndisclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, which may make it more difficult for investors and securities analysts to evaluate our company, and exemptions from the requirement of holding advisory \u201csay on pay\u201d votes on executive compensation and advisory votes on golden parachute compensation. We cannot predict if investors will find our Class A common stock less attractive if we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our Class A common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our Class A common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company, which in certain circumstances could be up to five years.\nOur business and stock price may suffer as a result of our lack of public company operating experience.\nPrior to our listing in 2015, we were a privately-held company since we began operations in 2011. Our lack of public company operating experience may make it difficult to forecast and evaluate our future prospects. If we are unable to execute our business strategy, either as a result of our inability to effectively manage our business in a public company environment or for any other reason, our prospects, financial condition, results of operations and stock price may be harmed.", "PERMNO": 15452, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "EVH"}
