{"cik": "1014111", "company": "GlassBridge Enterprises, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-04-03", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors that could have a material and adverse impact on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. These risks, uncertainties and other factors, including the ones discussed below, elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other filings with the SEC, could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. Investors should carefully consider such risks, together with all the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in evaluating us and our common stock.\nRisks Related to our Company and Common Stock\nPending and future litigation may lead us to incur significant costs.\nWe are subject to various threatened legal actions in the ordinary course of our business. With respect to our Legacy Business and Nexsan Business, claims have and may continue to arise from time to time alleging that we infringe on the intellectual property rights of others. See Item 3 for descriptions of current litigations. Additionally, we are subject to allegations of patent infringement by our competitors as well as by non-practicing entities, sometimes referred to as \u201cpatent trolls,\u201d who may seek monetary settlements from us.\nLitigation is always subject to many uncertainties and outcomes that are not predictable. Even when not merited, the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management\u2019s attention, and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. We use legal and appropriate means to contest litigation threatened or filed against us, but we have found there is a strong tendency toward litigation in the patent area in our industry and this litigation environment poses a business risk. The outcome of litigation is often difficult to predict, and the outcome of pending or future litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nOur participation in any joint investment could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority, our reliance on a partner\u2019s financial condition and disputes between us and our partners.\nWe may hold partial ownership interests in businesses or otherwise acquire businesses jointly or establish joint ventures with third parties, including equity positions that are not readily liquid. In such circumstances, we may not be in a position to exercise significant decision-making authority regarding a target business, partnership or other entity if we do not own a substantial majority of the equity interests of the target. These investments may involve risks not present were a third party not involved, including the possibility that partners might become insolvent or fail to fund their shares of required capital contributions. In addition, partners may have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives. Such partners, some of which may possess more industry or technical knowledge or have better access to capital and other resources, may also seek similar acquisition targets as us and we may be in competition with them for such business combination targets. Disputes between us and partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our costs and expenses and divert a substantial amount of our management\u2019s time and effort away from our business. Consequently, actions by, or disputes with, partners might result in subjecting assets owned by the partnership to additional risk. We may also, in certain circumstances, be liable for the actions of our third-party partners. For example, in the future, we may agree to guarantee indebtedness incurred by a partnership or other entity. Such a guarantee may be on a joint and several basis with our partner, in which case, we may be liable in the event such partner defaults on its guarantee obligation.\nFuture acquisitions or business opportunities could involve unknown risks that could harm our business and adversely affect our financial condition.\nAs part of our strategic plan to use excess capital, including through acquisitions, we may acquire interests in a number of different businesses, some of which may be outside of industries that have comprised our historical focus. We have in the past, and may in the future, acquire businesses or make acquisitions, directly or indirectly through our subsidiaries, that involve unknown risks, some of which will be particular to the industry in which the business or acquisition targets operate, including risks in industries with which we are not familiar or experienced. Although we intend to conduct extensive business, financial and legal due diligence in connection with the evaluation of future business or acquisition opportunities, there can be no assurance our due diligence investigations will identify every matter that could have a material adverse effect on us. We may be unable to adequately address the financial, legal and operational risks raised by such businesses or acquisitions, especially if we are unfamiliar with the relevant industry. The realization of any unknown risks could expose us to unanticipated costs and liabilities and prevent or limit us from realizing the projected benefits of the businesses or acquisitions, which could adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity. In addition, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted depending on the specific risks applicable to any business or company we acquire and our ability to address those risks.\nWe could consume resources in researching acquisitions, business opportunities or financings and capital market transactions that are not ultimately consummated, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or invest in another business.\nWe anticipate that the investigation of each specific acquisition or business opportunity and the negotiation, drafting, and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents, and other instruments with respect to such transaction will require substantial management time and attention and substantial costs for financial advisors, accountants, attorneys and other advisors. If a decision is made not to consummate a specific acquisition, business opportunity or financing and capital market transaction, the costs incurred up to that point for the proposed transaction likely would not be recoverable. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached relating to a specific acquisition, investment target or financing, we may fail to consummate the investment or acquisition for any number of reasons, including those beyond our control. Any such event could consume significant management time and result in a loss to us of the related costs incurred, which could adversely affect our financial position and our ability to consummate other acquisitions and investments.\nAdditional businesses or technologies we acquire could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our ongoing business, dilute stockholder value or have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe may engage in further acquisitions of businesses or technologies to augment our growth. Acquisitions involve challenges and risks in negotiation, execution, valuation and integration. Even if successfully negotiated, closed and integrated, certain acquisitions may not advance our business strategy, may fall short of expected return-on-investment targets or may fail. Any past or future acquisition could also involve additional risks, including:\n\u25cf potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management;\n\u25cf difficulty integrating the operations and products of the acquired business;\n\u25cf use of cash to fund the acquisition or for unanticipated expenses;\n\u25cf limited market experience in new businesses;\n\u25cf exposure to unknown liabilities, including litigation against the companies that we acquire;\n\u25cf additional costs due to differences in culture, geographical locations and duplication of key talent;\n\u25cf delays associated with or resources being devoted to regulatory review and approval and other ongoing compliance matters;\n\u25cf acquisition-related accounting charges affecting our balance sheet and operations;\n\u25cf difficulty integrating the financial results of the acquired business in our consolidated financial statements;\n\u25cf controls in the acquired business;\n\u25cf potential impairment of goodwill;\n\u25cf dilution to our current stockholders from the potential issuance of equity securities to consummate a proposed acquisition; and\n\u25cf potential loss of key employees or customers of the acquired company.\nIn the event that we enter into any acquisition agreements, closing of the transactions could be delayed or prevented by regulatory approval requirements, including antitrust review or other conditions. We may not be successful in addressing these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with any attempted acquisitions, and we could assume the economic risks of such failed or unsuccessful acquisitions. We may not realize the expected benefits of any acquisitions as rapidly as, or to the extent anticipated by, the marketplace, investors, financial analysts or industry analysts. Any such failure may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and stock price.\nThe market price of our common stock is volatile, and you may lose part or all your investment.\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile. Any of the factors discussed herein or such as the following may affect the market price of our common stock:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u25cf actions by our competitors;\n\u25cf developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights;\n\u25cf litigation;\n\u25cf changes in key personnel;\n\u25cf market conditions and trends in the businesses and industries in which we operate;\n\u25cf contraction in our operating results or growth rates;\n\u25cf the potential impact of activist investors;\n\u25cf changes in financial estimates by securities analysts relating specifically to us or the industries in which we participate in general; and\n\u25cf any future guidance we may provide to the public, any changes in such guidance or any difference between our guidance and actual results.\nIn addition, general economic conditions may cause the stock market to experience extreme price and volume fluctuations from time to time. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation against various companies following periods of market volatility. If we were involved in securities litigation, we could incur substantial costs and our resources and attention of management could be diverted from our business.\nWe may incur asset impairment charges for intangible assets and goodwill in the future.\nWe evaluate assets on our balance sheet, including such intangible assets and goodwill, annually in connection with our fiscal year end reporting or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. We monitor factors or indicators, such as unfavorable variances from forecasted cash flows, established business plans or volatility inherent to external markets and industries that would require an impairment test. The test for impairment of intangible assets requires a comparison of the carrying value of the asset or asset group with their estimated undiscounted future cash flows. If the carrying value of the asset or asset group is considered impaired, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. The test for impairment of goodwill requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting unit for which goodwill is assigned with the fair value of the reporting unit calculated based on discounted future cash flows. If the carrying value of the reporting unit is greater than the fair value a second step is performed to calculate any impairment. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company incurred impairment charges of $6.2 million related to intangible assets that were acquired when we closed a transaction with Clinton on February 2, 2017. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had goodwill of approximately $50.6 million as a result of the acquisition of a controlling interest in SportBLX, Inc.\nRisks Related to our Asset Management Business\nAAM has limited performance history, and any fund we may sponsor will be in its formation stage, without an operating history upon which prospective investors can evaluate the fund\u2019s performance.\nAAM and any fund we may sponsor have no operating history upon which prospective investors can evaluate the fund\u2019s performance. Poor performance of any funds we may sponsor is likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur Asset Management Business depends in large part on our ability to raise capital from third party investors. If we are unable to raise capital from third party investors, we will be unable to collect management fees or deploy their capital into investments and potentially collect performance fees, which would materially affect our ability to generate revenue and cash flow from our asset management business.\nOur ability to raise capital from third party investors depends on a number of factors, including certain factors that are outside our control. Certain factors, such as the performance of the stock market and the asset allocation rules or investment policies to which such third-party investors are subject, could inhibit or restrict the ability of third party investors to make investments in our funds or the asset classes in which our funds invest. There are no assurances that we can find or secure commitments from investors. If economic conditions were to deteriorate or if we are unable to find enough investors, we might raise less than our desired amount for a given fund. If we are unable to successfully raise enough capital, it could materially affect our ability to generate revenue and cash flow from our Asset Management Business, which could adversely affect our financial prospects and condition.\nIn addition, we intend to negotiate terms for our funds and investments with potential investors. The outcome of such negotiations could result in our agreement to terms that are materially less favorable to us than funds managed by our competitors. Such terms could restrict our ability to raise funds with objectives or strategies that compete with existing funds, add additional expenses and obligations for us in managing the fund or increase our potential liabilities, all of which could ultimately reduce our revenues.\nOur Asset Management Business is subject to extensive regulation, which increases our costs of doing business, and our failure to comply with regulatory requirements may harm our financial condition.\nOur Asset Management Business is subject to extensive regulation in the United States, particularly by the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. We are or may become subject to regulation under the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the Commodity Exchange Act, and various other statutes, regulations and rules. As a result of launching our Asset Management Business, we face increased costs in complying with newly applicable regulations, and we could continue to experience higher costs if new rules and regulatory actions or legislation require us to spend more time, hire additional personnel or buy new technology to comply with these rules and laws. The changes in laws or regulations could also have a material adverse effect on us by limiting the sources of our revenues and increasing our costs. Our business may be materially affected not only by securities regulations, but also by regulations of general application. For example, existing and proposed tax legislation and other governmental regulations and policies, including the interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve Board or cybersecurity regulation, could increase our compliance and other costs.\nAlthough we will strive to conduct our business in accordance with applicable laws or regulations, if we were found to have violated an applicable law or regulation, we could be subject to fines, suspensions of personnel or other sanctions, including revocation of our registration as an investment advisor. If a sanction were imposed against us or our personnel, even if only for a small monetary amount, the adverse publicity related to such a sanction could harm our reputation, result in redemptions by investors in the funds we may launch and impede our ability to attract new investors, all of which could result in a material adverse effect to our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe asset management business is intensely competitive.\nThe asset management business is intensely competitive, with competition based on a variety of factors, including investment performance, the quality of service provided to clients, investor liquidity and willingness to invest, fund terms, fees, brand recognition and business reputation. Our Asset Management Business competes with many domestic and global competitors that may provide investment products with similar features and objectives to those we offer. These institutions range from small boutique firms to large financial institutions. We expect that competition will continue to increase. A number of factors serve to increase our competitive risks: \t\n\u25cf a number of our competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources and more personnel than we do;\n\u25cf some of our funds may not perform as well as competitors\u2019 funds or other available investment products;\n\u25cf several of our competitors have significant amounts of capital, and many of them have similar investment objectives to ours, which may create additional competition for investment opportunities;\n\u25cf some of our competitors may have a lower cost of capital;\n\u25cf some of our competitors may have access to funding sources that are not available to us, which may create competitive disadvantages for us with respect to investment opportunities;\n\u25cf some of our competitors may be subject to less regulation and accordingly may have more flexibility to undertake and execute certain businesses or investments than we can and/or bear less compliance expense than we do;\n\u25cf some of our competitors may have more flexibility than us in raising certain types of investment funds;\n\u25cf some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances, different risk assessments or lower return thresholds, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and to bid more aggressively than us for investments that we want to make;\n\u25cf some of our competitors may be more successful than us in the development and implementation of new technology to address investor demand for product and strategy innovation;\n\u25cf there are relatively few barriers to entry impeding new alternative asset fund management firms, and the successful efforts of new entrants into our various businesses is expected to continue to result in increased competition;\n\u25cf some of our competitors may have better expertise or be regarded by investors as having better expertise in a specific asset class or geographic region than we do;\n\u25cf some investors may prefer to invest with an investment manager that is not publicly traded or is of a different size; and\n\u25cf other industry participants will from time to time seek to recruit our investment professionals and other employees away from us.\nThis competitive pressure could adversely affect our ability to make successful investments and may limit our ability to raise future investment funds, any of which would adversely impact our business, revenue, results of operations and cash flow.\nPrivacy and data security concerns, laws, or other regulations could expose us to liability or impair our operations.\nOur Asset Management Business requires collection of sensitive personal information. Privacy and data security are rapidly evolving areas of concern and regulation. Changes in laws restricting or otherwise governing data and transfer thereof could be difficult to comply with, result in increased costs, or impair our operations. Security measures that we implement may fail due to third-party attack, employee error or sabotage, or other causes. Hacking techniques change frequently and therefore can be difficult to prevent. In addition, service providers could suffer security breaches or data losses that affect investors\u2019 information. A security breach could damage our reputation, resulting in loss of investors, subject the Company to liability, or otherwise materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and financial performance.\nPoor performance of any investment funds we sponsor or accounts we manage would adversely affect our ability to generate revenue, income and cash flow, and could adversely affect our ability to raise capital for future investment funds and accounts.\nIn the event that any of our investment funds or accounts we manage were to perform poorly, our ability to generate revenue, income and cash flow, and our ability to raise capital for future investment funds and accounts, would be adversely affected. Moreover, we could experience losses on our investments of our own principal as a result of poor investment performance by our investment funds. Poor performance of our investment funds could make it more difficult for us to raise new capital. Potential investors in our funds will assess our investment funds\u2019 performance and our ability to raise capital and avoid excessive redemption levels will depend on our investment funds\u2019 satisfactory performance. Accordingly, poor fund performance may deter future investment in our funds and thereby decrease the capital invested in our funds and ultimately, our management fee revenue. Alternatively, in the face of poor fund performance, investors could demand lower fees or fee concessions which would likewise decrease our revenue.\nDifficult market and economic conditions, including, without limitation, changes in interest rates and volatile equity and credit markets, can adversely affect our Asset Management Business in many ways, including by reducing the value or performance of the investments made by any investment funds we may sponsor or accounts we manage, including, without limitation, any fund managed by Clinton, and reducing our ability to raise or deploy capital, each of which could adversely affect our revenue, earnings and cash flow and adversely affect our financial prospects and condition.\nOur Asset Management Business is materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions or events throughout the world that are outside our control, including but not limited to changes in interest rates, availability of credit, inflation rates, economic uncertainty, changes in laws (including laws relating to taxation), trade barriers, commodity prices, currency exchange rates and controls and national and international political circumstances (including wars, terrorist acts or security operations). These factors may affect the level and volatility of securities prices and the liquidity and the value of investments, and we may not be able to or may choose not to manage our exposure to these market conditions and/or other events. In the event of a market downturn, each of our businesses could be affected in different ways. We are unable to predict whether and to what extent uncertainty surrounding economic and market conditions will be reduced, and even in the absence of uncertainty, adverse conditions and/or other events in particular sectors may cause our performance to suffer further.\nChallenging market and economic conditions may make it more difficult and competitive to find suitable investments for any investment funds we may sponsor or accounts we manage, or to effectively raise or deploy capital. This could adversely affect our performance and ability to raise new funds. During periods of difficult market conditions or slowdowns (which may be across one or more industries, sectors or geographies), the value or performance of the investments made by any investment funds we may sponsor or accounts we manage may be reduced, which could adversely affect our revenue, earnings and cash flow and adversely affect our financial prospects and condition.\nDifficult economic conditions may adversely affect our businesses in many ways, including by reducing the value or hampering the performance of the investments made by our funds or reducing the ability of our funds to raise or deploy capital, each of which could materially reduce our revenue, net income and cash flow and adversely affect our financial prospects and condition.\nA financial downturn could adversely affect our operating results in a number of ways, and if the economy was to enter a recessionary or inflationary period, it may cause our revenue and results of operations to decline by causing:\n\u25cf our AUM to decrease, lowering management fees and other income from our funds;\n\u25cf\nadverse conditions for the portfolio companies of our funds (e.g., decreased revenues, liquidity pressures increased difficulty in obtaining access to financing and complying with the terms of existing financings, as well as increased financing costs);\n\u25cf\nlower investment returns, reducing performance fees; and\n\u25cf\nmaterial reductions in the value of our fund investments, affecting our ability to realize performance fees from these investments.\nLower investment returns and such material reductions in value may result because, among other reasons, during periods of difficult market conditions or slowdowns (which may be across one or more industries, sectors or geographies), companies in which our funds invest may experience decreased revenues, financial losses, difficulty in obtaining access to financing and increased funding costs. During such periods, these companies may also have difficulty in expanding their businesses and operations and be unable to meet their debt service obligations or other expenses as they become due, including expenses payable to us. In addition, during periods of adverse economic conditions, our funds and their portfolio companies may have difficulty accessing financial markets, which could make it more difficult or impossible to obtain funding for additional investments and harm our AUM and operating results.\nAny revenue, earnings, net income and cash flow attributable to our Asset Management Business is likely to be highly variable, which may make it difficult for us to achieve steady earnings growth on a quarterly basis and may cause the price of shares of our common stock to decline and be volatile.\nAny revenue, earnings, net income and cash flow attributable to our asset management business is likely to be highly variable. We may also experience fluctuations in our results, including our revenue and net income, from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, including changes in the valuations of our funds\u2019 investments, changes in the amount of distributions, dividends or interest paid in respect of investments, changes in our operating expenses, the degree to which we encounter competition and general economic and market conditions. The valuations of investments made by our funds could also be subject to high volatility as a result of uncertainty regarding governmental policy with respect to, among other things, tax reform, financial services regulation, international trade, immigration, healthcare, labor, infrastructure and energy. Achieving steady earnings growth on a quarterly basis may be difficult, which could in turn cause the price of shares of our common stock to decline and be volatile.\nThe potential future growth of our asset management business may place significant demands on our resources and employees, and may increase our expenses, risks and regulatory oversight.\nThe potential future growth of our asset management business may place significant demands on our infrastructure and our investment team and other employees, which may increase our expenses. The potential inability of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions could constrain our ability to expand our asset management businesses. We may face significant challenges in maintaining and developing adequate financial and operational controls, implementing new or updated information and financial systems, managing and appropriately sizing our work force, and updating other components of our business on a timely and cost-effective basis. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage the growth of our Asset Management Business effectively, or that we will be able to continue to grow, and any failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to generate revenue and control our expenses.\nIf we are unable to establish a favorable reputation our ability to grow our asset management business could be limited, and any damage to our reputation could harm our asset management business.\nOur success depends, in part, on establishing and maintaining a strong reputation in the investment community, Our reputation is vulnerable to many threats that can be difficult or impossible to control, and costly or impossible to remediate even if they are without merit or satisfactorily addressed. Our reputation may be impacted by many factors, including but not limited to, litigation, regulatory inquiries or investigations, conflicts of interest, employee misconduct or rumors. Any damage to our reputation could result in redemptions by investors in any funds we may sponsor or accounts we may manage and impede our ability to attract new investors or negatively impact our relationships with third party intermediaries, all of which could result in a material adverse effect to our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur asset management business is subject to extensive regulation, which increases our costs of doing business, and our failure to comply with regulatory requirements may harm our financial condition.\nOur asset management business is subject to extensive regulation in the United States, particularly by the SEC. We are or may become subject to regulation under the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and various other statutes, regulations and rules. As a result of launching our asset management business, we face increased costs in complying with newly applicable regulations, and we could continue to experience higher costs if new rules and regulatory actions or legislation require us to spend more time, hire additional personnel or buy new technology to comply with these rules and laws. The changes in laws or regulations could also have a material adverse effect on us by limiting the sources of our revenues and increasing our costs. Our business may be materially affected not only by securities regulations, but also by regulations of general application. For example, existing and proposed tax legislation and other governmental regulations and policies, including the interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve Board or cybersecurity regulation, could increase our compliance and other costs.\nAlthough we will strive to conduct our business in accordance with applicable laws or regulations, if we were found to have violated an applicable law or regulation, we could be subject to fines, suspensions of personnel or other sanctions, including revocation of our registration as an investment advisor. If a sanction were imposed against us or our personnel, even if only for a small monetary amount, the adverse publicity related to such a sanction could harm our reputation, result in redemptions by investors in the funds we may launch and impede our ability to attract new investors, all of which could result in a material adverse effect to our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to our Sports Investment Platform\nOur sports investment platform operates in a new area of finance.\nOur sports investment platform operates in a new area of finance. Whereas syndicated investing in sports teams is common, securitizing earnings of sports players is not yet an established practice. The Company will have to structure transactions that are attractive to investors, with little experience of its own or elsewhere as guidance. In addition, SportBLX will be required to effectively market the securities to investors to be successful and may be required to rely on third-party registered broker-dealers in this effort. To date, SportBLX has completed only one securitization and there can be no assurance of further transactions. Potential investors may be unwilling to invest in a relatively untried form of transaction or demand higher returns to offset greater risk.\nOur sports investment platform is a relatively new business.\nWe acquired a controlling interest in SportBLX only at the end of 2019, and SportBLX has been in business only since late 2018. Since its formation, SportBLX has completed only one financing transaction as of the filing of this annual report. Accordingly, potential investors in SportBLX-sponsored transactions have little basis on which to evaluate the quality of SportBLX offerings, and investors in the Company will have little basis on which to gauge SportBLX\u2019s contributions to the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nSportBLX may not be able to identify investment opportunities that are sufficiently attractive that potential investors would want to invest in them.\nOur sports investment platform will fail as a business, unless we develop a reputation for offering successful investments to investors. Our ability to do so will depend greatly upon our ability in selecting attractive assets for investors. We cannot assure you that we will be fully successful in these endeavors.\nOur business is sports-centric, and our success is tied to sports generally and, in particular, to changes in popularity of the sports on which we choose to focus.\nWe are largely dependent on the continued popularity of sports, generally, and, in particular, the popularity of the sports upon which we have chosen to focus including basketball, baseball and football. Changes in popularity of these sports globally or in particular, the United States, could be influenced by competition from other sports or alternative forms of entertainment. A change in sports fans\u2019 tastes, a change in perceptions relating to particular sports (for example, if a particular aspect of such sports become unpopular due to safety or other considerations), or a popularity shift towards sports events that are currently under-represented or not present in our portfolio, could result in reduced investment in our offerings and reduced revenue to the Company.\nSports related risks may negatively affect our business.\nSportBLX endeavors to structure its securities in athlete-based earnings streams such that investors have downside protection in their investment. However, we cannot assure that we will be fully successful in the structuring endeavors. Securities based on sports have inherent risks such as injury and poor performance, among others.\nThe offer and sale of securities is highly regulated, and consequences of noncompliance can be severe.\nThe offer, issuance, and sale, of securities are highly regulated by federal and state laws. To avoid registration and qualification of securities that we offer, we rely on exemptions from these laws that, among other things, require us to have a reasonable basis to believe that each person seeking to invest in securities that we offer is legally permitted to invest.\nWe may be required to make our offerings through a registered broker dealer licensed to sell securities in the states in which investors reside. We have engaged North Capital Private Securities Corporation (\u201cNCPSC\u201d), which is licensed to sell unregistered securities in 53 U.S. states and territories to act in this capacity as well as to vet investors on our behalf. SportBLX may be unable to operate its platform if NCPSC discontinues the engagement, or if we discontinue the engagement due to dissatisfaction with NCPSC\u2019s performance, and we are unable to find a suitable replacement. We cannot continue the engagement if we do not reasonably believe that NCPSC\u2019s determination of investors\u2019 qualification is reliable.\nFailure by SportBLX to comply with securities laws could make the Company liable for severe penalties and rescission of securities sales, as well as injunctions against SportBLX to cease operations. In addition, if SportBLX\u2019s operations were considered broker-dealer activity, SportBLX would have to cease operations until licensed as a broker-dealer, a substantial undertaking, and the Company would realize material adverse effects on results of operations and financial condition.\nPrivacy and data security concerns, laws, or other regulations could expose us to liability or impair our operations.\nSportBLX\u2019s operations require it to collect sensitive personal information. Privacy and data security are rapidly evolving areas of concern and regulation. Changes in laws restricting or otherwise governing data and transfer thereof could be difficult to comply with, result in increased costs, or impair our operations. Security measures that we implement may fail due to third-party attack, employee error or sabotage, or other causes. Hacking techniques change frequently and therefore can be difficult to prevent. In addition, service providers could suffer security breaches or data losses that affect investors\u2019 information. A security breach could damage our reputation, resulting in loss of investors, subject the Company to liability, or otherwise materially, adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and financial performance.\nIf we do not adapt to technological changes, the SportBLX platform may become less attractive to sports investors, which could have a material and adverse impact on the SportBLX business.\nThe internet industry is characterized by constant changes, including rapid technological evolution, continual shifts in customer demands, frequent introductions of new products, and services and constant emergence of new industry standards and practices. Thus, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to respond to these changes timely and cost-effectively; failure to do so may cause use of the SportBLX platform to decline and our business to be materially and adversely affected.\nAny failure or interruptions in the internet infrastructure, bandwidth providers, data center providers, other third parties or our own systems could adversely affect the SportBLX platform.\nOur platform depends on maintenance of the internet and other telecommunications services by third parties, including the Foundation. Such services include maintenance of a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed, data capacity and security for providing reliable internet access and services and reliable telecommunications systems that connect our operations. While the SportBLX platform is designed to operate without interruption, we may experience interruptions and delays in services and availability from time to time. We rely on systems as well as third-party vendors, including data center, bandwidth, and telecommunications equipment providers, to provide our solutions. We do not maintain redundant systems or facilities for some of these services. In the event of a catastrophic event with respect to one or more of these systems or facilities, we may experience an extended period of system unavailability, which could negatively impact our relationship with SportBLX platform users.\nWe face risks relating to third parties\u2019 billing and payment systems or from other service provider failures.\nThe billing and payment systems of third parties, such as online third-party payment processors, help us to maintain accurate records of payments of sales proceeds by paying users and collecting such payments. Our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if these third parties fail to accurately account for or calculate the revenues generated from of our services. Moreover, if there are security breaches or failure or errors in the payment process of these third parties, user experience may be affected and our business results may be negatively impacted.\nWe also do not have control over the security measures of our third-party payment service providers, and security breaches of the online payment systems that we use could expose us to litigation and possible liability for failing to secure confidential customer information and could, among other things, damage our reputation and the perceived security of all of the online payment systems we use. In addition, there may be billing software errors that would damage customer confidence in these payment systems. If any of the above were to occur, we may lose users, which may have an adverse effect on our business.", "PERMNO": 83602, "SIC": 6282, "TIC": "GLAE"}
