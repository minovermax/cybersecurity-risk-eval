{"cik": "874214", "company": "ANN INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-13", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nSet forth below is a summary of the material risks to an investment in our securities, which should be considered carefully in evaluating such an investment. These are not the only risks our Company faces. We may also be adversely affected by additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial. If any of the risks were to materialize, our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition may be materially adversely impacted , which might cause the value of our securities to decline. Please also see \u201cStatement Regarding Forward-Looking Disclosures\u201d in the section immediately preceding Item 1 of this Report.\nOur ability to anticipate and respond to changing client preferences and fashion trends in a timely manner\nOur success largely depends on our ability to consistently gauge fashion trends and provide a balanced assortment of merchandise that satisfies client demands for each of our brands in a timely manner. Any missteps may affect inventory levels, since we enter into agreements to manufacture and purchase our merchandise well in advance of the applicable selling season. Our failure to anticipate, identify or react appropriately in a timely manner to changes in client preferences, fashion trends and economic conditions could lead to, among other things, missed opportunities, excess inventory and more frequent markdowns or inventory shortages, all of which could negatively impact sales and gross margin performance and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Merchandise missteps could also negatively impact our image with our clients and result in diminished brand loyalty.\nOur ability to maintain our brand image, engage new and existing clients and gain market share\nOur ability to maintain our brand image and reputation is integral to our business as well as the implementation of strategies to expand it. Maintaining, promoting and growing our brands will depend largely on the success of our design, merchandising and marketing efforts and our ability to provide a consistent, high-quality client experience. In addition, while our brands are mature and we have extensive client lists, our success depends, in part, on our ability to keep existing clients engaged and attract new clients to shop our brands. Our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if we fail to achieve these objectives for either or both of our brands and failure to achieve consistent, positive performance at both of our brands simultaneously could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability. In addition, our ability to address the challenges of declining store traffic, including at factory outlet centers, in a highly promotional, low growth environment may impact our ability to maintain and gain market share and also impact our sales and profitability.\nThe effect of competitive pressures from other retailers as well as structural headwinds in the specialty retail sector\nThe women's specialty retail industry is highly competitive. We compete with local, national and international department stores, specialty and discount stores, catalogs and internet businesses offering similar categories of merchandise. We face a variety of competitive challenges, including anticipating and quickly responding to changing client demands or preferences, maintaining favorable brand recognition and effectively marketing our products to our clients in several diverse demographic markets, sourcing merchandise efficiently and developing innovative, high-quality merchandise in styles that appeal to our clients in ways that favorably distinguish us from our competitors. In addition, many of our competitors have advantages over us, including substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources. Increased levels of promotional activity by our competitors, some of whom may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can, both online and in stores, may negatively impact our sales and profitability. There is no assurance that we can compete successfully with these companies in the future. In addition to competing for sales, we compete for favorable store locations, lease terms and qualified associates. Increased competition in these areas may result in higher costs and reduce our operating margins, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, structural headwinds in the specialty retail sector are particularly challenging. The growth of fast fashion and value fashion retailers and expansion of off-price retailers has shifted shopper expectations to more affordable pricing of well-known brands and exacerbated the continued promotional pressure. The rise of these retailers as well as the shift in shopping preferences from brick-and-mortar stores to the online channel, where online only businesses or those with e-commerce capabilities continue to grow, have increased the difficulty of maintaining and gaining market share. A downturn or an uncertain outlook in the women\u2019s specialty retail sector in which we sell our products could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur reliance on key management and our ability to attract and retain qualified associates as well as ensure that we have the appropriate organizational structure and processes in place to achieve our strategic initiatives\nOur success depends to a significant extent upon both the continued services of our current executive and senior management team, as well as our ability to attract, hire, motivate and retain qualified management talent in the future. Our senior executive officers have substantial experience and expertise in the retail business and have made significant contributions to the growth and success of our brands. Competition for key executives in the retail industry is intense and our operations could be adversely affected if we cannot retain our key executives or fail to attract additional qualified individuals. Our performance also depends in large part on the talents and contributions of engaged and skilled associates in all areas of our organization. If we are unable to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain talented individuals, we may be unable to compete effectively and our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, as our business continues to evolve, we must ensure that we have the appropriate organizational structure and processes in place to achieve our strategic initiatives. If we are unable to accomplish these objectives, our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nOur reliance on third-party manufacturers and key vendors\nWe do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities, and therefore, depend on independent third parties to manufacture our merchandise. As such, we face the risk of increased manufacturing costs and cannot be certain that we will not experience operational difficulties with our manufacturers, such as reductions in speed, production capacity and flexibility; errors in complying with merchandise specifications; insufficient quality control; and failure to meet production deadlines. In addition, we source our merchandise from a select group of manufacturers and continue to strengthen our relationships with these key vendors. While this strategy has benefits, it also has risks. If one or more of our key vendors were to cease working with us, the flow of merchandise could be impacted. In addition, we cannot predict the impact of world-wide events, including inclement weather, natural disasters, public health issues, strikes, or political or economic conditions on our major suppliers. Our suppliers could also face economic pressures as a result of rising wages and inflation or experience difficulty obtaining adequate credit or access to liquidity to finance\ntheir operations, which could lead to vendor consolidation. While we have contingency plans for such potential risks, a manufacturer\u2019s failure to continue working with us, ship merchandise to us on a timely basis or meet our product safety, quality and social compliance standards could cause supply shortages, failure to meet client expectations and damage to our brands, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.\nOur dependence on our Louisville distribution center and third-party distribution and transportation providers\nOur wholly-owned and operated primary distribution center in Louisville, Kentucky manages the receipt, storage, sorting, packing and distribution of the majority of merchandise to our stores. We also utilize third-party distribution facilities in City of Industry, California and Toronto, Canada for distribution support to our stores. In addition, sales at our Websites are primarily processed by a third-party fulfillment provider with facilities in Bolingbrook, Illinois. Independent third-party transportation companies then deliver merchandise from these facilities to our stores and/or our clients. Any significant interruption in the operation of our Louisville distribution center, our third-party distribution, fulfillment or transportation providers or the various ports through which our merchandise enters the U.S., for any reason, including natural disasters, accidents, inclement weather, system failures, work stoppages, slowdowns or strikes or other unforeseen events and circumstances, could delay or impair our ability to distribute merchandise to our stores and/or our clients. This could lead to inventory issues, increased costs, lower sales and a loss of loyalty to our brands, among other things, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur reliance on foreign sources of production\nWe purchase a significant portion of our merchandise from foreign suppliers. As a result, we are subject to various risks of doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from abroad, such as:\n\u2022\nfluctuation in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies or restrictions on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries;\n\u2022\nforeign laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nimposition of additional legislation or agreements relating to import quotas or other restrictions that may limit the quantity of our merchandise that may be imported into the U.S. or Canada from countries in regions where our merchandise is manufactured;\n\u2022\nsignificant delays or disruptions in the delivery of cargo due to port security or congestion issues, labor disputes or shortages, local business practices, vendor compliance with applicable import regulations or weather conditions;\n\u2022\nimposition of duties, taxes and other charges on imports or exports;\n\u2022\nimposition of anti-dumping or countervailing duties in response to an investigation as to whether a particular product being sold in the U.S. or Canada at less than fair value may cause (or threaten to cause) material injury to the relevant domestic industry;\n\u2022\nfinancial or political instability or terrorist acts in any of the countries in which our merchandise is manufactured or the transportation channels through which it passes;\n\u2022\nthe impact of natural disasters, extreme weather, public health concerns or other catastrophes on our foreign sourcing offices and vendor manufacturing operations;\n\u2022\npotential cancellation of orders or recalls of any merchandise that does not meet our product safety and quality standards or is not manufactured in accordance with our social compliance requirements; and\n\u2022\nincreased security requirements applicable to imported goods and increased inspections of import shipments by domestic authorities.\nAny sudden disruptions in the manufacture or import of our merchandise caused by adverse changes in these or any other factors could increase the cost or reduce the supply of merchandise available to us and adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nThe effect of fluctuations in sourcing costs\nThe raw materials used to manufacture our merchandise are subject to availability constraints and price volatility caused by high or low demand for fabrics, labor conditions, transportation or freight costs, currency fluctuations, weather conditions, supply conditions, government regulations, inflation, market speculation and economic, climate and other unpredictable factors. We take steps to mitigate sourcing pressures from fluctuating raw material costs by making advance commitments on key core fabrics when required, leveraging our strong vendor relationships and using country sourcing flexibility. Despite these measures, an increase in the demand for, the price of and/or a decrease in the availability of the raw materials used to manufacture our merchandise could have a material adverse effect on our cost of sales or our ability to meet our clients\u2019 expectations. Additionally, increases in labor costs, as well as a shortage of skilled labor in certain areas of China, may also impact our sourcing costs. The cost of transportation has also been increasing, and these cost pressures are likely to persist. We may not be able to pass all or a portion of such higher sourcing costs onto our clients, which could negatively impact our profitability.\nThe impact of a privacy breach and the resulting effect on our business and reputation\nWe rely heavily on digital technologies for the successful operation of our business, including electronic messaging, digital marketing efforts and the collection and retention of client data and associate information. We also rely on other third parties to process credit card transactions, perform online e-commerce and social media activities and retain data relating to our financial position and results of operations, strategic initiatives and other important information. Despite the robust security measures we have in place, our facilities and systems, and those of our third-party service providers, may be vulnerable to cyber-security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or other similar events. Any actual or perceived misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential or personally identifiable information, whether by us or by our third-party service providers, could severely damage our reputation and our relationship with our clients, associates and investors as well as expose us to risks of litigation, liability or other penalties and materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, we may incur significant remediation costs in the event of a cyber-security breach or incident, including liability for stolen client or associate information, repairing system damage or providing credit monitoring or other benefits to affected clients or associates. We may also incur increased costs to comply with various applicable laws or industry standards regarding use and/or unauthorized disclosure of personal information. These and other cyber-security-related compliance, prevention and remediation costs may also adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, although we maintain cyber-security insurance, there can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will be sufficient, or that insurance proceeds will be paid to us in a timely manner.\nOur ability to manage inventory levels and changes in merchandise mix as well as optimize the operational aspects of our omni-channel fulfillment strategy\nThe long lead times required for a substantial portion of our merchandise make client demand difficult to predict and responding quickly to changes challenging. Though we have the ability to source certain product categories with shorter lead times, we enter into contracts for a substantial portion of our merchandise well in advance of the applicable selling season. Our financial condition could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to manage inventory levels and respond to short-term shifts in client demand patterns. Inventory levels in excess of client demand may result in excessive markdowns and, therefore, lower than planned sales and gross margin. On the other hand, if we underestimate demand for our merchandise, we may experience inventory shortages resulting in missed sales and lost revenues. Either of these events could significantly affect our operating results and brand image and loyalty. Our margins may also be impacted by changes in our merchandise mix and a shift toward merchandise with lower selling prices. These changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, our omni-channel fulfillment strategy, which aims to help optimize the client experience, improve merchandising decisions and support our omni-channel operations, creates additional complexities in our ability to manage inventory levels, as well as certain operational issues in stores and online, including packaging, shipping, timeliness and returns. Accordingly, our success depends to a large degree on continually evolving the processes and technology that enable us to plan and manage inventory levels and fulfill orders, address any related operational issues in store and online and further align both channels to optimize our omni-channel retail strategy. If we are unable to successfully manage the inventory complexities and operational issues associated with our omni-channel fulfillment strategy, we may experience an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nOur ability to successfully optimize implementation of our omni-channel retail strategy and maintain a relevant and reliable omni-channel experience for our clients\nWe are committed to growing our business through our omni-channel retail strategy. Our goal is to offer our clients seamless access to our brands and merchandise whenever and wherever they choose to shop. Accordingly, our success also depends on our ability to anticipate and implement innovations in sales and marketing strategies to appeal to existing and potential clients who increasingly rely on multiple portals, including mobile technologies, to meet their shopping needs. Failure to enhance our technology and marketing efforts to align with our clients\u2019 shopping preferences could significantly impair our ability to meet our strategic business and financial goals. If we do not successfully optimize the implementation of our omni-channel retail strategy or if it does not achieve its intended objectives, we may experience an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nOur ability to execute brand extensions and other growth strategies, including international expansion\nIn order to achieve long-term growth, part of our business strategy is to grow our existing brands and identify and develop new growth opportunities, including potential acquisitions. The launch of new merchandise offerings or concepts, such as Lou & Grey, or the addition of new businesses may require significant capital expenditures and management oversight. Any such plans are subject to risks, such as the lack of client acceptance, failure to differentiate products, competition and/or failure to successfully integrate operations and personnel or achieve the anticipated benefits of acquisitions. There is no assurance that these strategies\nwill be successful or that our overall profitability will increase as a result. In addition, if we fail to properly execute our plans or identify alternative strategies, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur growth strategy may also continue to include plans to develop new strategic partnerships as well as further expand our presence in both new and existing markets, including international markets. We have very limited experience operating outside of the U.S. or through alternative business models, such as franchises. International markets also present unique risks, including different operational characteristics in the areas of employment and labor, transportation, logistics, real estate, finance and law. Furthermore, consumer demand and behavior, as well as preferences and purchasing trends, may differ. Other challenges may include facing established competitors, as well as general economic conditions in specific countries or markets, disruptions or delays in shipments, changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, political instability and foreign governmental regulation. As a result of these and other factors, our efforts to enter foreign markets may not be successful, or the sales and profitability generated by our foreign operations may not be in line with our expectations. In addition, international expansion, including any difficulties that we may encounter if we were to expand to other international markets, may divert financial, operational and managerial resources from our existing operations and/or result in increased costs, which could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, as we continue to implement our plans for international expansion, we are subject to certain U.S. laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, as well as the laws of the foreign countries in which we operate. We must use all commercially reasonable efforts to ensure compliance with these laws. Any violations of such laws could subject us to sanctions or other penalties, which could negatively affect our reputation, business and results of operations.\nOur ability to successfully manage our Internet business and deliver an integrated omni-channel shopping experience to our clients\nOur Internet business is a key component of our omni-channel retail strategy and subject to numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe failure to successfully implement new systems, system enhancements and Internet platforms, including our omni-channel and online international order fulfillment and enhanced mobile capability;\n\u2022\nthe failure of our technology infrastructure or the computer systems that operate our websites and their related support systems, causing, among other things, website downtimes, telecommunications issues or other technical failures;\n\u2022\nthe reliance on third-party computer hardware/software providers;\n\u2022\nrapid technological change;\n\u2022\nliability for online content;\n\u2022\nviolations of federal, state, foreign or other applicable laws, including those relating to online privacy;\n\u2022\ncredit card fraud;\n\u2022\nvulnerability to electronic break-ins and other similar disruptions; and\n\u2022\nmoderating Internet sales growth.\nOur failure to successfully address and respond to these risks could negatively impact sales, increase costs and damage the reputation of our brands.\nOur ability to successfully upgrade and maintain our information systems in a timely and secure manner to support the needs of the organization\nWe rely heavily on information systems to manage our operations, including a full range of retail, financial, sourcing and merchandising systems. We regularly make investments to upgrade, enhance or replace these systems, as well as leverage new technologies to support our growth strategies. We have also implemented enterprise-wide initiatives that are intended to standardize business processes and optimize performance. Any delays or difficulties transitioning to new systems or integrating them with current systems or the failure to implement our initiatives in an orderly and timely fashion could result in additional investment of time and resources, which could impair our ability to improve existing operations and support future growth.\nIn addition, the reliability and capacity of our information systems are critical. Despite preventative efforts, our systems are vulnerable from time-to-time to damage or interruption from, among other things, natural disasters, technical malfunctions, inadequate systems capacity, human error, power outages, computer viruses and security breaches. Failure to maintain adequate system security controls to protect our computer assets and sensitive data, including associate and client data, from unauthorized access, disclosure or use could damage our reputation with our associates and our clients and expose us to risks of litigation and liability. Finally, our ability to continue to operate our business without significant interruption in the event of a disaster or other disruption depends, in part, on the ability of our information systems to operate in accordance with our disaster recovery and business continuity plans. Any disruptions affecting our information systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nAs a component of our ongoing strategy to increase efficiencies, monitor costs and improve our information technology capabilities, we rely on third parties for products and implementation and/or management of certain aspects of our information\nsystems and infrastructure. Many of the functions that are performed by third parties are performed in offshore locations. Our agreements with those third parties require them to maintain certain levels of care and security with respect to our information systems and our data. Failure by any of these third parties to implement and/or manage our information systems and infrastructure effectively and securely could disrupt our operations, adversely affect our clients\u2019 shopping experience and negatively impact our profitability. Furthermore, the use of offshore service providers may expose us to risks related to local political, economic, social or environmental conditions (including acts of terrorism, the outbreak of war or the occurrence of natural disasters), restrictive actions by foreign governments or changes in U.S. laws and regulations.\nOur ability to secure and protect trademarks and other intellectual property rights\nWe believe that our trademarks and other intellectual property rights are critical to our success. Even though we register and defend our trademarks and other intellectual property rights, there is no assurance that our actions will protect us from the prior registration by others or prevent others from infringing our trademarks and intellectual property rights or seeking to block sales of our products as infringements of their trademarks and intellectual property rights. Further, the laws of foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. Because we have not registered without opposition all of our trademarks in all categories, or in all foreign countries in which we currently manufacture merchandise or may manufacture or sell merchandise in the future, our ability to source merchandise from international suppliers or pursue international expansion could be negatively impacted. Any litigation regarding our trademarks could be time-consuming and costly. Moreover, if we are not successful, the loss of exclusive use of our trademarks and other proprietary rights could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nFailure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements\nOur business is subject to legal and regulatory requirements in the U.S. and abroad, including, without limitation, those required by the SEC, the New York Stock Exchange and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as securities, tax, environmental, health care, privacy, employment and anti-bribery laws and regulations. In addition, in the future, there may be new legal or regulatory requirements or more stringent interpretations of applicable requirements, which could increase the complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related cost of compliance.\nWhile it is our policy and practice to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements and our procedures and internal controls are designed to ensure such compliance, we are involved from time to time in litigation arising primarily in the ordinary course of business. Litigation matters may include, among other things, employment, commercial, intellectual property, advertising or shareholder claims. A finding that we or our vendors or agents are out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to civil remedies or criminal sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation and stock price. In addition, even the claim of a violation of applicable laws or regulations could negatively affect our reputation. We believe that our current litigation matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. However, our assessment of current litigation could change in light of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions pending against us, not presently known to us, or determinations by judges, juries or other finders of fact which do not accord with our evaluation of the possible liability or outcome of such litigation as well as additional litigation that is not currently pending.\nThe effect of general economic conditions\nOur financial performance is dependent on consumer confidence and levels of consumer spending, which may remain volatile for the foreseeable future. Some of the factors impacting consumer confidence and discretionary consumer spending include, but are not limited to: general economic conditions; fiscal and monetary policies of governments; wages and unemployment; consumer debt; reductions in net worth based on market declines or declines in the residential real estate and mortgage markets; tax policies; increases in fuel and energy prices; changes in interest rates; the threat of or actual terrorist attacks; military conflicts and the domestic and international political environment. Consumer purchases of discretionary items, including our merchandise, generally decline during recessionary periods and other periods where disposable income is adversely affected. A downturn in the economy could affect consumer purchases of our merchandise and lead to excess inventory levels, which could materially adversely affect our liquidity, capital resources, results of operations and continued growth.\nIn addition, as a result of general unpredictability in the global financial markets, there can be no assurance that our liquidity will not be affected or that our capital resources will at all times be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity needs. Although we believe that our existing cash, cash provided by operations and available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future, any tightening of the credit markets could make it more difficult for us to access funds, enter into agreements for new indebtedness or obtain funding through the issuance of our securities. Our revolving credit facility also has financial covenants and certain restrictions which, if not met, may further impede our ability to access funds.\nWe also have significant amounts of cash on deposit at FDIC-insured financial institutions that are currently in excess of federally insured limits and therefore, we cannot be assured that we will not experience losses with respect to cash on deposit in excess of such limits.\nOur ability to successfully manage store growth and optimize the productivity and profitability of our store portfolio\nOur continued growth and success depend, in part, on our ability to successfully open and operate new stores, enhance and remodel existing stores on a timely and profitable basis and optimize overall store performance by closing under-performing stores. Accomplishing our store expansion goals depends upon a number of factors, including locating suitable sites and negotiating favorable lease terms. We must also be able to effectively renew and renegotiate lease terms for existing stores. Managing the profitability of our stores and optimizing store productivity also depends, in large part, on the continued success and client acceptance of our store formats, maintenance of the appropriate fleet size relative to brick and mortar sales and our ability to achieve planned store growth for our brands in Fiscal 2015 and beyond. Hiring and training qualified associates, particularly at the store management level, maintaining overall good relations with our associates and vendors and managing inventory and distribution effectively to meet the needs of new and existing clients on a timely basis are also important to our store operations. There is no assurance that we will achieve our store expansion goals, manage our growth effectively or operate our stores profitably. In addition, the challenges of declining store traffic and the inability to achieve acceptable results in new and existing stores could lead to store closures and/or asset impairment charges, which could adversely affect our results of operations and impact our future growth.\nOur dependence on shopping malls and other retail centers to attract clients to our stores and ability to negotiate acceptable lease terms\nMany of our stores are located in shopping malls and other retail centers that benefit from the ability of \u201canchor\u201d retail tenants, generally large department stores, and other attractions, to generate sufficient levels of consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores. Any decline in the volume of consumer traffic at shopping centers, whether because of the economic slowdown, a decline in the popularity of shopping centers, the closing of anchor stores or otherwise, could result in reduced sales at our stores and excess inventory. We may have to respond by increasing markdowns or initiating marketing promotions to reduce excess inventory, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, continued consolidation in the commercial retail real estate market could affect our ability to successfully negotiate favorable rental terms for our stores in the future. Should significant consolidation continue, a large proportion of our store base could be concentrated with one or a few entities that could then be in a position to dictate unfavorable terms to us due to their significant negotiating leverage. If we are unable to negotiate favorable lease terms with these entities, this could affect our ability to profitably operate our stores, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nManufacturer compliance with our social compliance program requirements\nWe require our independent manufacturers to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, as well as our Global Supplier Principles and Guidelines, which cover many areas, including labor, health, safety, environmental and other legal standards. We monitor compliance with these Guidelines using third-party monitoring firms. Although we have an active program to provide training for our independent manufacturers and monitor their compliance with these standards, we do not control the manufacturers or their practices. Any failure of our independent manufacturers to comply with our Global Supplier Principles and Guidelines or labor or other local laws in the country of manufacture, or the divergence of an independent manufacturer\u2019s labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the U.S., could disrupt the shipment of merchandise to our stores, force us to locate alternative manufacturing sources, reduce demand for our merchandise, damage our reputation and/or expose us to potential liability for their wrongdoings. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations.\nThe impact of fluctuations in sales and profitability on our stock price\nA variety of factors has historically affected, and will continue to affect, our comparable sales results and profit margins. These factors include fashion trends and client preferences, changes in our merchandise mix, competition, economic conditions, extreme or unseasonable weather, effective inventory management and new store openings, among other things. There is no assurance that we will achieve positive levels of sales and earnings growth and any decline in our future growth or performance could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nOur stock price has experienced, and could continue to experience in the future, substantial volatility as a result of many factors, including actual or anticipated financial results, global economic conditions, broad market fluctuations, our operating performance and public perception of the prospects for our brands or for the women\u2019s apparel industry in general. Failure to meet market expectations, particularly with respect to sales, operating margins, net income and earnings per share, could result in a decline in the market value of our stock.\nEffects of natural disasters, war, terrorism, public health concerns or other catastrophes\nNatural disasters, extreme weather and public health concerns, including severe infectious diseases, could impact our ability to open and run our corporate offices, distribution center, stores and other operations in affected areas and/or negatively impact our foreign sourcing offices and the operations of our vendors. In addition, our ability to continue to operate our business without significant disruption in the event of a disaster or other event depends, in part, on the ability of our information systems to operate in accordance with our disaster recovery and business continuity plans. Lower client traffic due to the effect of natural disasters or extreme weather, security concerns, war or the threat of war and public health concerns could result in decreased sales that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, both the threat of or actual terrorist events in the U.S. and world-wide could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy, disrupt the production, shipment or receipt of our merchandise or lead to lower client traffic. Our ability to mitigate the adverse impact of these events depends, in part, upon the effectiveness of our disaster preparedness and response planning as well as business continuity planning. However, we cannot be certain that our plans will be adequate or implemented properly in the event of an actual disaster or other catastrophic situation. In addition, although we maintain business interruption and property insurance, there can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will be sufficient, or that insurance proceeds will be timely paid to us.\nThe effect of tax matters on our business operations\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions. In addition, our products are subject to import and excise duties and/or sales or value-added taxes in certain jurisdictions. We are also subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other domestic, international and local tax authorities and government bodies. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, however, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. Any changes in tax rates, tax legislation or regulations, and/or tax accounting rules and regulations or interpretations thereof or an adverse outcome related to a tax examination could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in future periods.", "PERMNO": 76671, "SIC": 5621, "TIC": "ANN"}
