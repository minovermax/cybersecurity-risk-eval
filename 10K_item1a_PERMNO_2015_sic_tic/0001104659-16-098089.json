RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. Before making a decision to purchase our securities, you should carefully consider all of the risks described in this annual report. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business and results of operations. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be seriously harmed. In that event, the market price for our common stock could decline and you may lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe may not be able to meet our cash requirements beyond the third quarter of 2016 without obtaining additional capital from external sources, and if we are unable to do so, we may not be able to continue as a going concern.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $3.9 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, which we anticipate will meet our cash requirements into the third quarter of 2016. However, in order for us to continue as a going concern beyond that point, we may be required to obtain capital from external sources. As a result, the audit opinion on our consolidated financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2015 includes an explanatory paragraph regarding our ability to continue as a going concern as described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nIn order to issue securities at a price below the exercise prices of our outstanding warrants issued in connection with our past preferred stock financings, we must obtain the affirmative consent of holders of at least 67% of each series of such outstanding warrants. If we are unable to obtain the consent of these holders in connection with future financings, we may be unable to raise additional capital on acceptable terms, or at all. If external financing sources are not available in a timely manner or at all, or are inadequate to fund our operations, it could result in reduced revenues and cash flows from the sales of our diagnostic services and/or could jeopardize our ability to launch, market and sell additional products and services necessary to grow and sustain our operations.\nWe have a history of losses and expect to incur additional losses in the future.\nWe have sustained substantial losses since our inception. We may never become profitable, or if we do, we may not be able to sustain profitability. We expect to incur significant research and development, marketing, general and administrative expenses. As a result, we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future.\nTo date, we have relied primarily upon selling equity and convertible debt and equity securities to generate the funds needed to finance the implementation of our business strategies. We cannot assure you that we will not encounter unforeseen difficulties, including the outside influences identified below that may deplete our capital resources more rapidly than anticipated. We may be required to obtain additional financing through bank borrowings, debt or equity financings or otherwise, which would require us to make additional investments or face a dilution of our equity interests. We cannot be sure that additional funding will be available on favorable terms, if at all. If we fail to obtain additional funding when needed, we may not be able to execute our business plans or continue operations, and our business may be materially adversely affected.\nWe began commercialization of our molecular diagnostics services in 2006. Accordingly, we have a limited operating history of generating revenues from services. In addition, we are still developing our technologies and service offerings and are subject to the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies with such limited operating histories. Since we have a limited operating history, we cannot assure you that our operations will become profitable or that we will generate sufficient revenues to meet our expenditures and support our activities.\nBecause our business operations are subject to many uncontrollable outside influences, we may not succeed.\nOur business operations are subject to numerous risks from outside influences, including the following:\n\u00b7 Technological advances may make our array-based technology less competitive or even obsolete, and as a result, our revenue and the value of our assets could materially decrease.\nOur services are dependent upon oligonucleotide and SNP array-based technologies. These technologies compete with conventional diagnostic technologies such as karyotyping, FISH and polymerase chain reaction, or PCR-based tests. Many newly developed tests rely on Next Generation Sequencing, or NGS, and there is a trend in the field toward increased usage of NGS-based testing. Our services are substantially dependent upon our ability to offer the latest in microarray technology in the cytogenomic market. We expect to face additional competition from new market entrants and consolidation of our existing competitors. Many of our competitors have existing strategic relationships with major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, greater commercial experience and substantially greater financial and personnel resources than we do. We expect new competitors to emerge and the intensity of competition to increase in the future. If these companies are able to offer technological advances, our services may become less valuable or even obsolete. We cannot provide any assurance that existing or new competitors will not enter the market with the same or similar technological advances before we are able to do so.\n\u00b7 Our technologies face uncertain market value.\nOur business includes many services, some of which were more recently introduced into the market. We cannot provide any assurance that the increase, if any, in market acceptance of these technologies and services will meet or exceed our expectations. Further, we are developing services, some of which have not yet been introduced into the market. A lack of or limited market acceptance of these technologies and services will have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations.\n\u00b7 We obtain components and raw materials from a limited number of sources and, in some cases, a single source, and the loss or interruption of our supply sources may materially adversely impact our ability to provide testing services to meet our existing or future sales targets.\nSubstantially all of the components and raw materials used in providing our testing services, including microarray slides and reagents, are currently provided to us from a limited number of sources or in some cases from a single source. Any supply interruption in a sole-sourced component or raw material might result in up to a several-month delay and materially harm our ability to provide testing services until a new source of supply, if any, could be located and qualified. In addition, an uncorrected impurity or supplier\u2019s variation in a raw material, either unknown to us or incompatible with our process, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to provide testing services. We may be unable to find a sufficient alternative supply channel in a reasonable time period, or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nAny one of the foregoing outside influences may require us to seek additional financing to meet the challenges presented or to mitigate a loss in revenue, and we may not be able to obtain the needed financing in a timely manner on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Further, any one of the foregoing outside influences affecting our business could make it less likely that we will be able to gain acceptance of our array technology by researchers in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and academic communities.\nOur revenues will be unpredictable, and this may materially adversely affect our financial condition.\nThe amount and timing of revenues that we may realize from our business will be unpredictable because whether our services are commercialized and generate revenues depends, in part, on the efforts and timing of our potential customers. Also, our sales cycles may be lengthy. As a result, our revenues may vary significantly from quarter to quarter, which could make our business difficult to manage and cause our quarterly results to be below market expectations. If this happens, the price of our common stock may decline significantly. Our revenues are also subject to seasonality factors and can be impacted by circumstances outside of our control, such as patient and IVF clinic vacation schedules and severe weather conditions that hamper or otherwise restrict when a patient seeking genetic diagnostic services such as ours visits the ordering physician.\nWe face intense competition, and we cannot assure you that we will be successful competing in the market.\nThe diagnostics market is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, changes in customer needs, emerging competition and new product and services introductions. One or more of our competitors may offer technology superior to ours and render our technology obsolete or uneconomical. Many of our competitors have greater financial and personnel resources and more experience in marketing, sales and research and development than we have. If we were not able to compete successfully, our business and financial condition would be materially harmed.\nIf our technology is not widely adopted by physicians and laboratories in the diagnostics market, our business will be materially adversely affected.\nIn order to be successful, our test offerings must meet the commercial requirements of hospitals and physicians and be considered the standard of care in order to be widely adopted. Market acceptance will depend on many factors, including:\n\u00b7 the benefits and cost-effectiveness of our services relative to others available in the market;\n\u00b7 our ability to provide testing services in sufficient quantities with acceptable quality and reliability and at an acceptable cost;\n\u00b7 our ability to develop and market additional tests and enhance existing tests that are responsive to the changing needs of our customers; and\n\u00b7 the willingness and ability of customers to adopt new technologies or the reluctance of customers to change technologies upon which they have previously relied.\nThe U.S. FDA\u2019s decision to regulate Laboratory Developed Tests, or LDTs, could prevent us from offering existing tests and/or delay the introduction of new testing services.\nDuring 2014, the FDA publicly announced that it has decided to exercise regulatory authority over LDTs and that it plans to issue guidance to the industry regarding its regulatory approach. The FDA has indicated that it will use a risk-based approach to regulation and will direct more resources to tests with wider distribution and with the highest risk of injury, but that it will be sensitive to the need to not adversely impact patient care or innovation. On October 3, 2014, the FDA published two draft guidance documents regarding proposals for the regulation of LDTs in the Federal Register. The 120-day public comment period on the draft documents began at issuance and lasted until February 2, 2015. Since this time, industry stakeholders have responded to the FDA draft guidance document during the public comment period, both for and against, with final guidance expected in 2016. The regulatory approach adopted by the FDA may lead to an increased regulatory burden, including additional costs and delays in introducing new tests. While the ultimate impact of the FDA\u2019s approach is unknown, it may be extensive and may result in significant change. Our failure to adapt to these changes could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nU.S. healthcare reform legislation may result in significant changes and our business could be adversely impacted if we fail to adapt.\nGovernment oversight of and attention to the healthcare industry in the United States is significant and increasing. In March 2010, U.S. federal legislation was enacted to reform healthcare. The legislation provides for reductions in the Medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule beginning in 2011 and also includes a productivity adjustment that reduces the CPI market basket update beginning in 2011. The legislation imposes an excise tax on the seller for the sale of certain medical devices in the United States, including those purchased and used by laboratories, beginning in 2013. The legislation establishes the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which is responsible for submitting proposals aimed at reducing Medicare cost growth while preserving quality. These proposals automatically will be implemented unless Congress enacts alternative proposals that achieve the same savings targets. Further, the legislation calls for the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation to examine alternative payment methodologies and conduct demonstration programs. The legislation provides for extensive health insurance reforms, including the elimination of pre-existing condition exclusions and other limitations on coverage, fixed percentages on medical loss ratios, expansion in Medicaid and other programs, employer mandates, individual mandates, creation of state and regional health insurance exchanges, and tax subsidies for individuals to help cover the cost of individual insurance coverage. The legislation also permits the establishment of accountable care organizations, a new healthcare delivery model.\nWhile the ultimate impact of the health reform and related legislation on the healthcare industry is unknown, it is likely to be extensive and may result in significant change. Our failure to adapt to these changes could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA significant component of our revenue is dependent upon successful insurance claims. Our revenue will be diminished if payors do not adequately cover or reimburse us for our services.\nPhysicians and patients may decide not to order our high-complexity genomic microarray tests unless third-party payors, such as managed care organizations as well as government payors such as Medicare and Medicaid, pay a substantial portion of the test price. Reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend on a number of factors, including a payor\u2019s determination that tests using our technologies are:\n\u00b7 not experimental or investigational;\n\u00b7 medically necessary;\n\u00b7 appropriate for the specific patient;\n\u00b7 cost-effective;\n\u00b7 supported by peer-reviewed publications; and\n\u00b7 included in clinical practice guidelines.\nA substantial portion of the testing for which we bill our hospital and laboratory clients is ultimately paid by third-party payors. However, there is uncertainty concerning third-party payor reimbursement of any test, including our high-complexity genomic microarray tests. Several entities conduct technology assessments of medical tests and devices and provide the results of their assessments for informational purposes to other parties. These assessments may be used by third-party payors and health care providers as grounds to deny coverage for a test or procedure. It is possible that federal, state and third-party insurers may limit their coverage of our tests in the future.\nIncreasing emphasis on managed care in the United States is likely to put pressure on the pricing of healthcare services. Uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of new applications or services. Governmental payors and private payors are scrutinizing new medical products and services. Such third-parties may not cover, or may limit coverage and resulting reimbursement for our services.\nAdditionally, third-party insurance coverage may not be available to patients for any of our existing tests or tests we may add in the future. Any pricing pressure exerted by these third-party payors on our customers may, in turn, be exerted by our customers on us. If governmental payors, including their contracted administrators, and other third-party payors do not provide adequate coverage and/or timely reimbursement for our services, our operating results, cash flows, or financial condition may materially decline.\nOur business could be adversely impacted by the adoption of new coding for molecular genetic tests.\nCertain Common Procedural Terminology, or CPT, codes that we use to bill for our microarray tests were omitted by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, from the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule in 2013. The pricing omission has forced state Medicaid plans and third party payors to determine their own price independent of CMS\u2019s recommendations (or lack thereof). There can be no guarantees that Medicaid and other payors will establish favorable reimbursement rates or adequate coverage policies. If payors do not recognize the value of the molecular genetic tests we offer or do not provide coverage for molecular tests such as ours, our revenues, earnings and cash flows could be adversely impacted.\nOur cash flows and financial condition may materially decline if payors do not reimburse us for our services in a timely manner.\nWe depend on our payors to reimburse us for our services in timely manner. If our payors do not reimburse us in a timely manner, our cash flows and financial condition may materially decline.\nThird-party billing is extremely complicated and could result in us incurring significant additional costs.\nBilling for molecular laboratory services is extremely complicated. The client is the party that orders the tests and the payor is the party that pays for the tests, and the two are not typically the same. Depending on the billing arrangement and/or applicable law, we need to bill various payors, such as patients, health insurance companies, Medicare, Medicaid, doctors and employer groups, all of which have different billing requirements. Health insurance companies and governmental payors also generally require complete and correct billing information within certain filing deadlines. Additionally, our billing relationships require us to undertake internal audits to evaluate compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as internal compliance policies and procedures. Health insurance companies also impose routine external audits to evaluate payments made. Additional factors complicating billing include:\n\u00b7 pricing differences between our fee schedules and the reimbursement rates of the payors;\n\u00b7 disputes with payors as to which party is responsible for payment; and\n\u00b7 disparity in coverage and information requirements among various carriers.\nWe incur significant additional costs as a result of our participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, as billing and reimbursement for laboratory testing are subject to considerable and complex federal and state regulations. The additional costs we expect to incur as a result of our participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs include costs related to, among other factors: (1) complexity added to our billing processes; (2) training and education of our employees and customers; (3) implementing compliance procedures and oversight; (4) collections and legal costs; (5) challenging coverage and payment denials; and (6) providing patients with information regarding claims processing and services, such as advanced beneficiary notices. If these costs increase, our results of operations will be materially adversely affected.\nLoss of or adverse changes to our accreditations or licenses could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects and results of operations.\nThe clinical laboratory testing industry is highly regulated. We are subject to the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or CLIA, a federal law that regulates clinical laboratories that perform testing on specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease. CLIA is intended to ensure the quality and reliability of clinical laboratories in the United States by mandating specific standards in the areas of personnel qualifications, administration, and participation in proficiency testing, patient test management, quality control, quality assurance and inspections. We have a current certificate of accreditation under CLIA to perform testing. To renew this certificate, we are subject to survey and inspection every two years. Moreover, CLIA inspectors may make random inspections of our clinical reference laboratory. A failure to pass such inspections would result in suspension of our certificate of accreditation, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe are also required to maintain a laboratory license to conduct testing in California. California laws establish standards for day-to-day operation of our clinical reference laboratory, including the training and skills required of personnel and quality control. Moreover, several states require that we hold licenses to test specimens from patients in those states. Other states may have similar requirements or may adopt similar requirements in the future. A failure to obtain and maintain these licenses would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nComplying with numerous regulations pertaining to our business is an expensive and time-consuming process, and failure to comply could result in significant penalties and suspension of one or more of our licenses.\nAreas of the regulatory environment that may affect our ability to conduct business include, without limitation:\n\u00b7 Federal and state laws applicable to billing and claims payment and/or regulatory agencies enforcing those laws and regulations;\n\u00b7 Federal and state laboratory anti-mark-up laws;\n\u00b7 Federal and state anti-kickback laws;\n\u00b7 Federal and state false claims laws;\n\u00b7 Federal and state self-referral and financial inducement laws, including the federal physician anti-self-referral law, or the Stark Law;\n\u00b7 Coverage and reimbursement levels by Medicare, Medicaid, other governmental payors and private insurers;\n\u00b7 Restrictions on reimbursements for our services;\n\u00b7 Federal and state laws governing laboratory testing, including CLIA;\n\u00b7 Federal and state laws governing the development, use and distribution of diagnostic medical tests known as \u201chome brews\u201d;\n\u00b7 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA;\n\u00b7 Federal and state regulation of privacy, security and electronic transactions;\n\u00b7 State laws regarding prohibitions on the corporate practice of medicine;\n\u00b7 State laws regarding prohibitions on fee-splitting;\n\u00b7 Federal, state and local laws governing the handling and disposal of medical and hazardous waste; and\n\u00b7 Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA, rules and regulations.\nThe above-noted laws and regulations are extremely complex and, in many instances, there are no significant regulatory or judicial interpretations of such laws and regulations. We also may be subject to regulation in foreign jurisdictions as we seek to expand international distribution of our tests. Any determination that we have violated these laws, or the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of these laws, would materially adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. Violations could also result in extensive civil and/or criminal penalties, loss of licensure or accreditation (which could in turn affect our ability to operate or collect reimbursement), exclusion from government healthcare programs or private payer networks, and other materially adverse effects. In addition, a significant change in any of these laws may require us to change our business model in order to maintain compliance with these laws, which could reduce our revenue or increase our costs and materially adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe are subject to significant environmental, health and safety regulation.\nWe are subject to licensing and regulation under federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety, including laws and regulations relating to the handling, transportation and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials, as well as to the safety and health of laboratory employees. In addition, OSHA has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for health care employers, including clinical laboratories, whose workers may be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as HIV and the hepatitis B virus. These regulations, among other things, require work practice controls, protective clothing and equipment, training, medical follow-up, vaccinations, and other measures designed to minimize exposure to, and transmission of, blood-borne pathogens. In addition, the federally enacted Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act requires, among other things, that we include in our safety programs the evaluation and use of engineering controls such as safety needles if found to be effective at reducing the risk of needlestick injuries in the workplace. If we are found in violation of any of these regulations, we could be subject to substantial penalties or discipline and our business, prospects and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to stringent laws and regulations governing the privacy, security and transmission of medical information, and our failure to comply could subject us to criminal penalties and civil sanctions.\nGovernmental laws and regulations protect the privacy, security and transmission of medical information. Such laws and regulations restrict our ability to use or disclose patient identifiable laboratory data, without patient authorization, for purposes other than payment, treatment or healthcare operations (as defined by HIPAA), except for disclosures for various public policy purposes and other permitted purposes outlined in the privacy regulations. The privacy and security regulations provide for significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of PHI, including potential civil and criminal fines and penalties. Such regulations were expanded under the HITECH Act, including rules impacting the release of protected health information, patients\u2019 right to access such information, the content and manner of providing notice of a breach, and information system security requirements. We also could incur damages under state laws to private parties for the wrongful use or disclosure of confidential health information or other private personal information. In addition, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services has published HIPAA regulations to protect the privacy of health information when it is exchanged electronically during certain financial and administrative transactions. These HIPAA transaction standards are complex and different payers interpret them differently. Complying with applicable transmission standards is costly and failure to comply could disrupt our receipts or subject us to penalties. Generally, any security breach of our information systems, including the theft of our patients\u2019 financial information due to our failure to comply with applicable security standards, would adversely impact our business and our reputation.\nOur services development efforts may be hindered if we are unable to gain access to patients\u2019 tissue and blood samples.\nThe development of our diagnostic services requires access to tissue and blood samples from patients who may or may not have the diseases we are addressing. Our clinical development relies on our ability to secure access to these samples, as well as information pertaining to their associated clinical outcomes. Access to samples can be difficult since it may involve multiple levels of approval, complex usage rights and privacy rights, among other issues. Lack of or limited access to samples would harm our future services development efforts, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIf our current laboratory facility becomes inoperable or loses certification, we will be unable to perform our tests and our business will be materially adversely affected.\nOur diagnostic tests are operated out of our CLIA-certified laboratory in Irvine, California. Currently, we do not have a second certified laboratory. Should our only CLIA-certified laboratory be unable to perform tests, for any reason, we may be unable to perform needed diagnostic tests in connection with our development of technologies services and our business will be materially adversely affected.\nOur future success depends on the continued service from our scientific, technical and key management personnel and our ability to identify, hire and retain additional scientific, technical and key management personnel in the future.\nThere is intense competition for qualified personnel in our industry, particularly for laboratory technicians, scientific and medical experts and senior level management. Loss of the services of, or failure to recruit, these key personnel could be significantly detrimental to us and could materially adversely affect our business and operating results. We may not be able to continue to attract and retain scientific and medical experts or other qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business or to replace key personnel who may leave us in the future. If our business grows, it will place increased demands on our resources and likely will require the addition of new management personnel. An inability to recruit and retain qualified management and employees on commercially reasonable terms would adversely and materially affect our business.\nAs our operations expand, our costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations will increase, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could materially harm our financial results.\nOur operations involve the use, transportation, storage and disposal of hazardous substances and, as a result, we are subject to environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. As we expand our operations, our use of hazardous substances will increase and lead to additional and more stringent requirements. The cost to comply with these and any future environmental and health and safety regulations could be substantial. In addition, our failure to comply with laws and regulations, and any releases of hazardous substances into the environment or at our disposal sites, could expose us to substantial liability in the form of fines, penalties, remediation costs and other damages, or could lead to a curtailment or shut down of our operations. These types of events, if they occur, would materially adversely affect our financial results.\nWe could face substantial liabilities if we are sued for product liability.\nProduct liability claims could be filed by someone alleging that our tests failed to perform as claimed. We may also be subject to liability for errors in the performance of our tests. Such product liability and related claims could be substantial. Defense of such claims could be time consuming and expensive and could result in damages that are not covered by our insurance.\nExposure to possible litigation and legal liability may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the past, we have been exposed to a variety of litigation claims and there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to other litigation in the future that may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFailure to effectively manage our growth could place strains on our managerial, operational and financial resources and could materially adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur growth has placed, and is expected to continue to place, a strain on our managerial, operational and financial resources. In addition, any further growth by us or an increase in the number of our strategic relationships may constrain our ability to achieve the rapid execution necessary to successfully implement our business plan.\nAs a public company, we are subject to complex legal and accounting requirements that will require us to incur substantial expense and will expose us to risk of non-compliance.\nAs a public company, we are subject to numerous legal and accounting requirements that do not apply to private companies. The cost of compliance with many of these requirements is substantial, not only in absolute terms but, more importantly, in relation to the overall scope of the operations of a small company. Failure to comply with these requirements can have numerous material adverse consequences including, but not limited to, our inability to file required periodic reports on a timely basis, which would result in the loss of our eligibility to use Form S-3 for raising capital, loss of market confidence, delisting of our securities, governmental or private actions against us and/or liquidated damages payable to the holders of our Series A Warrants, Series C Warrants and our April 2015 private placement warrants. We cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with all of these requirements or that the cost of such compliance will not prove to be a substantial competitive disadvantage compared to our privately held and larger public competitors.\nEthical, legal and social concerns surrounding the use of genetic information could reduce demand for our test offerings.\nGenetic testing has raised ethical issues regarding privacy and the appropriate uses of the resulting information. For these reasons, governmental authorities may call for limits on or regulation of the use of genetic testing or prohibit testing for genetic predisposition to certain conditions, particularly for those that have no known cure. Similarly, such concerns may lead individuals to refuse to use genetics tests even if permissible. Any of these scenarios could reduce the potential markets for our molecular diagnostic services, which reduction could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related To Investment In Our Securities\nSmall company stock prices are especially volatile, and this volatility may depress the price of our stock.\nThe stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations, and the market prices of small companies have been highly volatile. We believe that various factors may cause the market price of our stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including, among others, announcements of:\n\u00b7 our or our competitors\u2019 technological innovations;\n\u00b7 supply, manufacturing, or distribution disruptions or other similar problems;\n\u00b7 proposed laws regulating participants in the laboratory services industry;\n\u00b7 developments in relationships with collaborative partners or customers;\n\u00b7 our failure to meet or exceed securities analysts\u2019 expectations of our financial results; or\n\u00b7 a change in financial estimates or securities analysts\u2019 recommendations.\nIn the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the objects of securities class action litigation. If we become the object of securities class action litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, all of which could materially adversely affect the business and financial results of our business.\nFuture sales or the potential for future sales of our securities in the public markets may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline and could impair our ability to raise capital through subsequent equity offerings.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or other securities in the public markets, or the perception that these sales may occur, could cause the market price of our common stock or other securities to decline and could materially impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional securities. The shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series E convertible preferred stock and upon exercise of our outstanding warrants are freely tradable, without restriction, in the public market. We have obligations to the investors in our 2012 private placement offering of Series A convertible preferred stock and warrants to purchase common stock and in our 2013 private placement offering of Series C convertible preferred stock and warrants to maintain the public registration of common stock underlying their issued and outstanding warrants. We also have obligations to the investors in our April 2011 private placement that could require us to register shares of common stock held by them and shares issuable upon exercise of their warrants for resale on a registration statement. If we raise additional capital in the future through the use of our existing shelf registration statement or if we register existing, or agree to register future, privately placed shares for resale on a registration statement, such additional shares would be freely tradable, and, if significant in amount, such sales could further adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The sale of a large number of shares of our common stock also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and at the prices that we deem appropriate.\nOur stock price could decline because of the potentially dilutive effect of future financings, preferred stock anti-dilution provisions or exercises of warrants and common stock options.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 845,374 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. Assuming exercise in full of all options, warrants and convertible securities outstanding as of December 31, 2015 (not taking into account any price-based or anti-dilution adjustments related to the Series E convertible preferred stock), approximately 1.7 million shares of our common stock would be outstanding. Any additional equity or convertible debt financings in the future could result in further dilution to our stockholders. Existing stockholders also will suffer significant dilution in ownership interests and voting rights and our stock price could decline as a result of potential future application of anti-dilution features of our Series E convertible preferred stock.\nWe may fail to meet market expectations because of fluctuations in our quarterly operating results, all of which could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the future. It is possible that, in future periods, our revenues could fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, all of which could cause the market price of our stock to decline. The following are among the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly from period to period:\n\u00b7 our unpredictable revenue sources;\n\u00b7 the nature, pricing and timing of our and our competitors\u2019 products and/or services;\n\u00b7 changes in our and our competitors\u2019 research and development budgets;\n\u00b7 expenses related to, and our ability to comply with, governmental regulations of our services and processes; and\n\u00b7 expenses related to, and the results of, patent filings and other proceedings relating to intellectual property rights.\nWe anticipate significant fixed expenses due in part to our need to continue to invest in services development. We may be unable to adjust our expenditures if revenues in a particular period fail to meet our expectations, all of which would materially adversely affect our operating results for that period. As a result of these fluctuations, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our financial results will not necessarily be meaningful, and you should not rely on these comparisons as an indication of our future performance.\nOur common stock may be delisted from The NASDAQ Capital Market if we cannot maintain compliance with NASDAQ\u2019s continued listing requirements.\nWhile we are currently in compliance with NASDAQ\u2019s stockholders\u2019 equity requirement and minimum bid price requirement, there are no assurances that we will be able to sustain long-term compliance with NASDAQ\u2019s stockholders\u2019 equity requirement or minimum bid price requirement. If we fail to maintain compliance with the applicable requirements, our stock may be delisted. Delisting from The NASDAQ Capital Market could make trading our common stock more difficult for investors, potentially leading to declines in our share price and liquidity. Without a NASDAQ Capital Market listing, stockholders may have a difficult time getting a quote for the sale or purchase of our stock, the sale or purchase of our stock would likely be made more difficult and the trading volume and liquidity of our stock could decline. Delisting from The NASDAQ Capital Market could also result in negative publicity and could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital. The absence of such a listing may adversely affect the acceptance of our common stock as currency or the value accorded by other parties. Further, if we are delisted, we would also incur additional costs under state blue sky laws in connection with any sales of our securities. These requirements could severely limit the market liquidity of our common stock and the ability of our stockholders to sell our common stock in the secondary market. If our common stock is delisted by NASDAQ, our common stock may be eligible to trade on an over-the-counter quotation system, such as the OTCQB market, where an investor may find it more difficult to sell our stock or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our common stock. We cannot assure you that our common stock, if delisted from The NASDAQ Capital Market, will be listed on another national securities exchange or quoted on an over-the counter quotation system.\nIf we are delisted from The NASDAQ Capital Market, your ability to sell your shares of our common stock would also be limited by the penny stock restrictions, which could further limit the marketability of your shares.\nIf our common stock is delisted, it would come within the definition of \u201cpenny stock\u201d as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, and would be covered by Rule 15g-9 of the Exchange Act. That Rule imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. For transactions covered by Rule 15g-9, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction prior to the sale. Consequently, Rule 15g-9, if it were to become applicable, would affect the ability or willingness of broker-dealers to sell our securities, and accordingly would affect the ability of stockholders to sell their securities in the public market. These additional procedures could also limit our ability to raise additional capital in the future.\nThe significant influence over stockholder voting matters that may be exercised by our 5% or greater stockholders may limit your ability to influence corporate actions.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our 5% or greater stockholders collectively have voting power over approximately 38% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, our 5% or greater stockholders, acting together, may be able to influence matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, management changes and approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of voting power may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a change in control and might reduce the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 89613, "SIC": 8071, "TIC": "CBMX"}
