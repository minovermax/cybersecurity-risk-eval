RISK FACTORS\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nWe are affected by the risks faced by commercial aircraft operators and MROs because they are our customers.\nWe operate as a supplier of engines, aircraft and related parts (\u201caviation equipment\u201d) to commercial aircraft operators and MROs and are indirectly impacted by all the risks facing commercial aircraft operators and MROs today. The ability of each lessee to perform its obligations under the relevant lease and the demand of companies to purchase aviation equipment will depend primarily on the lessee\u2019s (or in the case of parts and materials, the purchaser\u2019s) financial condition and cash flow. This may be affected by factors beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions in the countries in which our customers operate, including changes in gross domestic product;\n\u2022\ndemand for air travel and air cargo shipments;\n\u2022\nincreased competition;\n\u2022\nthe availability of government support, which may be in the form of subsidies, loans (including export/import financing), guarantees, equity investments or otherwise;\n\u2022\nchanges in interest rates and the availability and terms of credit available to commercial aircraft operators including covenants in financings, terms imposed by credit card issuers, collateral posting requirements contained in fuel hedging contracts and the ability of airlines and MROs to make or refinance principal payments as they come due;\n\u2022\ngeopolitical and other events, including concerns about security, terrorism, war, pandemics and similar public health concerns and political instability;\n\u2022\nchanging political conditions, including risk of rising protectionism and imposition of new trade barriers;\n\u2022\ninclement weather and natural disasters;\n\u2022\nenvironmental compliance and other regulatory costs, including noise regulations, emissions regulations, climate change initiatives, and aircraft age limitations;\n\u2022\ncyber risk, including information hacking, viruses and malware;\n\u2022\nlabor contracts, labor costs and strikes or stoppages at commercial aircraft operators;\n\u2022\noperating costs, including the price and availability of fuel, maintenance costs, and insurance costs and coverages;\n\u2022\ntechnological developments;\n\u2022\nairport access and air traffic control infrastructure constraints;\n\u2022\nindustry capacity, utilization and general market conditions; and\n\u2022\nmarket prices for aviation equipment.\nTo the extent that our customers are negatively affected by these risk factors, we may experience:\n\u2022\na decrease in demand for some types of aviation equipment in our portfolio;\n\u2022greater credit risks from our customers, and a higher incidence of lessee defaults and corresponding repossessions;\n\u2022\nan inability to quickly lease engines and aircraft on commercially acceptable terms when these become available through our purchase commitments and regular lease terminations;\n\u2022\nshorter lease terms, which may increase our expenses and reduce our utilization rates; and\n\u2022\nfewer opportunities to manage aviation equipment for other companies, and/or less profitable terms.\nOur operating results vary and comparisons to results for preceding periods may not be meaningful.\nDue to a number of factors, including the risks described in this ITEM 1A, our operating results may fluctuate. These fluctuations may also be caused by:\n\u2022the timing and number of purchases and sales of engines or aircraft;\n\u2022\nthe timing and amount of maintenance reserve revenues recorded resulting from the termination of long term leases, for which significant amounts of maintenance reserves may have accumulated;\n\u2022the termination or announced termination of production of particular aircraft and engine types;\n\u2022the retirement or announced retirement of particular aircraft models by aircraft operators;\n\u2022the operating history of any particular engine, aircraft or engine or aircraft model;\n\u2022the length of our operating leases; and\n\u2022the timing of necessary overhauls of engines and aircraft.\nThese risks may reduce our utilization rates, lease margins, maintenance reserve revenues and proceeds from engine and aircraft sales, and result in higher legal, technical, maintenance, storage and insurance costs related to repossession and the cost of engines being off-lease. As a result of the foregoing and other factors, the availability of engines and aircraft for lease or sale periodically experiences cycles of oversupply and undersupply of given engine or aircraft models. The incidence of an oversupply of engines or aircraft may produce substantial decreases in lease rates and the appraised and resale value of aviation equipment and may increase the time and costs incurred to lease or sell engines.\nWe anticipate that fluctuations from period to period will continue in the future. As a result, we believe that comparisons to results for preceding periods may not be meaningful and that results of prior periods should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.\nWe and our customers operate in a highly regulated industry and changes in laws or regulations may adversely affect our ability to lease or sell our engines or aircraft.\nLicenses and consents\nWe and our customers operate in a highly regulated industry. A number of our leases require specific governmental or regulatory licenses, consents or approvals. These include consents for certain payments under the leases and for the export, import or re-export of our engines or aircraft. Consents needed in connection with future leasing or sale of our engines or aircraft may not be received timely or have economically feasible terms. Any of these events could adversely affect our ability to lease or sell engines or aircraft.\nCivil aviation regulation\nUsers of engines and aircraft are subject to general civil aviation authorities, including the FAA and the EASA, who regulate the maintenance of engines and issue airworthiness directives. Airworthiness directives typically set forth special maintenance actions or modifications to certain engine and aircraft types or series of specific engines that must be implemented for the engine or aircraft to remain in service. Also, airworthiness directives may require the lessee to make more frequent inspections of an engine, aircraft or particular engine parts. Each lessee of an engine or aircraft generally is responsible for complying with all airworthiness directives. However, if the engine or aircraft is off lease, we may be forced to bear the cost of compliance with such airworthiness directives, and if the engine or aircraft is leased, subject to the terms of the lease, if any, we may be forced to share the cost of compliance.\nEnvironmental regulation\nGovernmental regulations of noise and emissions levels may be applicable where the related airframe is registered, and where the aircraft is operated. For example, jurisdictions throughout the world have adopted noise regulations which require all aircraft to comply with Stage III noise requirements. In addition to the current Stage III compliance requirements, the United States and the ICAO have adopted a more stringent set of \u201cStage IV\u201d standards for noise levels which apply to engines manufactured or certified from 2006 onward. At this time, the United States regulations do not require any phase-out of aircraft that qualify only for Stage III compliance, but the European Union has established a framework for the imposition of operating limitations on non-Stage IV aircraft. These regulations could limit the economic life of our engines and aircraft or reduce their value, could limit our ability to lease or sell the non-compliant engines or aircraft or, if modifications are permitted, require us to make significant additional investments in the engines or aircraft to make them compliant.\nThe United States and other jurisdictions are imposing more stringent limits on the emission of nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide emissions from engines, consistent with ICAO standards. These limits generally apply only to engines manufactured after 1999. In 2005, the European Union launched an Emissions Trading System limiting greenhouse gas emissions by various industries and persons, including aircraft operators. Concerns over global warming, climate change or other environmental issues could result in more stringent limitations on the operation of older, non-compliant engines and aircraft.\nFailure to comply with anti-corruption laws, trade controls, economic sanctions and similar laws and regulations could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nOur operations are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption and trade control laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and other anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions, [including the UK Bribery Act 2010,] export controls and economic sanctions programs, including those administered by the U.S. Department of State, U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d) and the Bureau of Industry and Security (\u201cBIS\u201d) of the Department of Commerce.\nAs part of our business, we may deal with state-owned business enterprises, the employees of which are considered foreign officials for purposes of the FCPA\u2019s prohibition on providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business or securing any improper business advantage. In addition, we must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the\nexport of products and technology from the U.S. and other countries having jurisdiction over our operations. Obtaining the necessary export license or other authorization for a particular lease may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of leasing opportunities.\nWe are also subject to certain economic and trade sanctions programs that are administered by OFAC, which prohibit or restrict transactions to or from or dealings with specified countries, their governments, and in certain circumstances, their nationals, and with individuals and entities that are specially-designated nationals of those countries. It is possible that, without our knowledge, engines or other equipment that we export end up in the possession of individuals or entities that have been designated by OFAC or are located in a country subject to sanctions.\nWe have established policies and procedures designed to assist with our compliance with these laws and regulations. However, maintaining and enhancing our policies and procedures in response to changing laws and regulations or business circumstances can be costly and place restrictions on our operations, and we cannot guarantee that the precautions we take will prevent violations of anti-corruption and trade control laws and regulations. Violations of these regulations are punishable by civil penalties, including fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions, asset seizures, debarment from government contracts and revocations or restrictions of licenses, as well as criminal fines and imprisonment. In addition, the costs associated with responding to a government investigation and remediating any violations can be substantial. Accordingly, violations could adversely affect, among other things, our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur aircraft, engines or parts could cause bodily injury or property damage, exposing us to liability claims.\nWe are exposed to potential liability claims if the use of our aircraft, engines or parts is alleged to have caused bodily injury or property damage. Our leases require our lessees to indemnify us against these claims and to carry insurance customary in the air transportation industry, including liability, property damage and hull all risks insurance on our engines and on our aircraft at agreed upon levels. We can give no assurance that one or more catastrophic events will not exceed insurance coverage limits or that lessees\u2019 insurance will cover all claims that may be asserted against us. Any insurance coverage deficiency or default by lessees under their indemnification or insurance obligations may reduce our recovery of losses upon an event of loss.\nOur financial reporting for lease revenue may be adversely impacted by the new model for lease accounting, as well as any future change to current tax laws or accounting principles pertaining to operating or other lease financing.\nOur lessees enjoy favorable accounting and tax treatment generally by using operating leases. Changes in tax laws or accounting principles that make operating leases less attractive to our lessees could have a material adverse effect on demand for our leases and on our business.\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d). If there are future changes in GAAP with regard to how we and our customers must account for leases, it could change the way we and our customers conduct our businesses and, therefore, could have the potential to have an adverse effect on our business.\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standard Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2016-02, \u201cLeases (Topic 842)\u201d (\u201cASU 2016-02\u201d). The FASB issued ASU 2016-02 to increase transparency and comparability among organizations recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. Under ASU 2016-02, lessors will account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing GAAP for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases. Unlike current guidance, however, a lease with collectability uncertainties may be classified as a sales-type lease. If collectability of lease payments, plus any amount necessary to satisfy a lessee residual value guarantee, is not probable, lease payments received will be recognized as a deposit liability and the underlying assets will not be derecognized until collectability of the remaining amounts becomes probable. The amendments in this accounting standard update are effective for the Company on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company has adopted this accounting standard update effective January 1, 2019. The Company has adopted the standard using the optional transition method with no restatement of comparative periods and a cumulative effect adjustment, if any, recognized as of the date of adoption.\nWe may not be adequately covered by insurance.\nBy virtue of holding title to engines and aircraft, parties suffering damage as a result of malfunction of an engine or aircraft may assert that lessors are strictly liable for losses resulting from the operation of the engines and aircraft. Such liability may be asserted even under circumstances in which the lessor is not directly controlling the operation of the relevant aircraft. While we maintain contingent insurance covering losses not covered by our lessees\u2019 insurance, such coverage may not be available in circumstances where the lessees\u2019 insurance coverage is insufficient. In addition, if a lessee is not obligated to maintain sufficient insurance, we may incur the costs of additional insurance coverage during the related lease. We are required under certain of our debt facilities to obtain political risk insurance for leases to lessees in specified jurisdictions. We can give no assurance that such insurance will be available at commercially reasonable rates, if at all.\nWe and our lenders generally are named as additional insureds on liability insurance policies carried by our lessees and are usually the loss payees for damage to our engines and aircraft. However, an uninsured or partially insured claim, or a claim for which third-party indemnification is not available, could have a material adverse effect upon us. A loss of an aircraft where we lease the airframe, an engine or other leased equipment could result in significant monetary claims for which there may not be sufficient insurance coverage.\nNatural disasters, public health emergencies, such as the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus, and other business disruptions could cause significant harm to our customer base, which may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur business could be adversely impacted by the effects of public health emergencies such as the recent coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in Asia, which has spread to other parts of the world, including North America and Europe, and has already significantly impacted the airline industry. The current concerns related to COVID-19 have resulted in a number of countries imposing travel restrictions and mandatory quarantine periods for people traveling from affected regions, causing significant economic disruption, a reduction in commercial airline traffic and flight cancellations. The continuing spread of the virus to other countries and regions may result in the imposition of additional restrictions, increased flight cancellations and greater reluctance to travel, all of which may lead to greater economic disruption and a broader adverse impact on air travel and the aviation industry, resulting in lower demand for leases of our aircraft and engines and possibly impacting the ability of our lessees to satisfy their payment obligations to us. The International Air Transport Association recently estimated that the airline industry may lose up to $113 billion in sales due to reductions in air travel and flight cancellations as a result of the coronavirus.\nOur U.S. and international operations and warehouse facilities are also susceptible to losses and interruptions caused by floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, typhoons, and similar natural disasters, as well as power outages, telecommunications failures, and similar events.\nA decrease in air travel, lack of demand for air travel or downturn in the aviation industry caused by public health emergencies or natural disasters could result in lower utilization of our engine and aircraft assets, which could in turn materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the occurrence of natural disasters and health emergency or similar events in any of the regions in which we operate could disrupt the operations of our business.\nRisks Related to Our Aviation Assets\nThe value and lease rates of our engines and aircraft could decline.\nThe value of a particular model of engine depends heavily on the types of aircraft on which it may be installed and the supply of available engines. We believe values of engines tend to be relatively stable so long as there is sufficient demand for the host aircraft, and the demand for aircraft depend on numerous factors, including age, technology, and customer preference. We believe the value of an engine begins to decline rapidly once the host aircraft begins to be retired from service and/or used for spare parts in significant numbers. Certain types of engines and aircraft may be used in significant numbers by commercial aircraft operators that are currently experiencing financial difficulties. If such operators were to go into liquidation or similar proceedings, the resulting over-supply of engines and aircraft from these operators could have an adverse effect on the demand for the affected engine and aircraft types and the values of such aviation equipment.\nUpon termination of a lease, we may be unable to enter into new leases or sell the affected aviation equipment on acceptable terms.\nWe directly or indirectly own the aviation equipment that we lease to customers and bear the risk of not recovering our entire investment through leasing and selling the applicable aircraft and engines. Upon termination of a lease, we seek to enter a new lease or to sell or part-out the applicable aviation equipment. We also selectively sell aviation equipment on an opportunistic basis. We cannot give assurance that we will be able to find, in a timely manner, a lessee or a buyer for aviation equipment coming off-lease or for the associated parts. If we do find a lessee, we may not be able to obtain satisfactory lease rates and terms (including maintenance and redelivery conditions) or rates and terms comparable to our current leases, and we can give no assurance that the creditworthiness of any future lessee will be equal to or better than that of the existing lessees of our engines. For engine leases with terms of 12 months or less, which as of December 31, 2019 constituted approximately 52.3% of our leased engines, we may frequently need to remarket such engines. We face the risk that we may not be able to keep our engines on lease consistently.\nAlthough leases of engines account for most of our revenue, leases of aircraft expose us to greater risks than leases of engines and these risks could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to a number of risks related to our aircraft leasing activities. For example, leases of aircraft subject us to greater maintenance risks because the maintenance fees we charge may not cover aircraft maintenance costs that may be higher than anticipated. In addition, we face greater credit risk from lessees in this business as our aircraft lessees may file for bankruptcy which could result in us incurring greater losses with respect to aircraft than with respect to engines. Moreover, aircraft technology is constantly improving and, as a result, aircraft of a particular model and type tend to become obsolete and less in demand over time, when newer, more advanced\nand efficient aircraft become available. Consequently, we may experience difficulty in leasing or selling aircraft. Any of these risks could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe carry the risk of maintenance for our leased assets. Our maintenance reserves may be inadequate or lessees may default on their obligations to perform maintenance, which could increase our expenses.\nUnder most of our engine and aircraft leases, the lessee makes monthly maintenance reserve payments to us based on the asset\u2019s usage and management\u2019s estimate of maintenance costs. A certain level of maintenance reserve payments on the WEST II, WEST III and WEST IV engines are held in related engine reserve restricted cash accounts. Generally, the lessee under long term leases is responsible for all scheduled maintenance costs, even if they exceed the amounts of maintenance reserves paid. Ninety of our leases comprising approximately 23.8% of the net book value of our on-lease assets at December 31, 2019 do not provide for any monthly maintenance reserve payments to be made by lessees, and we can give no assurance that future leases of our engines or aircraft will require maintenance reserves. In some cases, including engine and aircraft repossessions, we may decide to pay for refurbishments or repairs if the accumulated use fees are inadequate.\nWe can give no assurance that our operating cash flows and available liquidity reserves, including the amounts held in the reserve restricted cash accounts, will be sufficient to fund necessary engine and aircraft maintenance. Actual maintenance reserve payments by lessees and other cash that we receive may be significantly less than projected as a result of numerous factors, including defaults by lessees. Furthermore, we can provide no assurance that lessees will meet their obligations to make maintenance reserve payments or perform required scheduled maintenance or, to the extent that maintenance reserve payments are insufficient, to cover the cost of refurbishments or repairs.\nFailures by lessees to meet their maintenance and recordkeeping obligations under our leases could adversely affect the value of our leased engines and aircraft and our ability to lease the engines and aircraft in a timely manner following termination of the leases.\nThe value and income producing potential of an engine or aircraft depends heavily on it being maintained in accordance with an approved maintenance system and complying with all applicable governmental directives and manufacturer requirements. In addition, for an engine or aircraft to be available for service, all records, logs, licenses and documentation relating to maintenance and operations of the engine or aircraft must be maintained in accordance with governmental and manufacturer specifications.\nOur leases make the lessees primarily responsible for maintaining the engines or aircraft, keeping related records and complying with governmental directives and manufacturer requirements. Over time, certain lessees have experienced, and may experience in the future, difficulties in meeting their maintenance and recordkeeping obligations as specified by the terms of our leases.\nOur ability to determine the condition of the engines or aircraft and whether the lessees are properly maintaining our assets is generally limited to the lessees\u2019 reporting of monthly usage and any maintenance performed, confirmed by periodic inspections performed by us and third-parties. A lessee\u2019s failure to meet its maintenance or recordkeeping obligations under a lease could result in:\n\u2022\na grounding of the related engine or aircraft;\n\u2022\na repossession that would likely cause us to incur additional and potentially substantial expenditures in restoring the engine or aircraft to an acceptable maintenance condition;\n\u2022\na need to incur additional costs and devote resources to recreate the records prior to the sale or lease of the engine or aircraft;\n\u2022\nloss of lease revenue while we perform refurbishments or repairs and recreate records; and\n\u2022\na lower lease rate and/or shorter lease term under a new lease entered into by us following repossession of the engine or aircraft.\nAny of these events may adversely affect the value of the engine or aircraft, unless and until remedied, and reduce our revenues and increase our expenses. If aviation equipment is damaged during a lease and we are unable to recover from the lessee or though insurance, we may incur a loss.\nThe advent of superior engine and aircraft technology and higher production levels could cause our existing portfolio of aviation equipment to become outdated and therefore less desirable.\nAs manufacturers introduce technological innovations and new types of engines and aircraft, certain engines and aircraft in our existing portfolio of aviation equipment may become less desirable to potential lessees or purchasers. This next generation of engines and aircraft is expected to deliver improved fuel consumption and reduced noise and emissions with lower operating costs compared to current-technology aircraft.\nThe introduction of new models of engines and aircraft and the potential resulting overcapacity in supply, could adversely affect the residual values and the lease rates for our engines and aircraft, our ability to lease or sell our engines and aircraft on favorable terms, or at all, or result in us recording future impairment charges.\nOur customers face intense competition and some carriers are in troubled financial condition.\nAs a general matter, commercial aircraft operators with weak capital structures are more likely than well-capitalized operators to seek operating leases, and, at any point in time, investors should expect a varying number of lessees and sub-lessees to experience payment difficulties. As a result of such commercial aircraft operators\u2019 weak financial condition and lack of liquidity, a portion of lessees over time may be significantly in arrears in their rental or maintenance payments and may default on their lease obligations. Given the size of our portfolio of engines and aircraft, we expect that from time to time some lessees will be slow in making, or will fail to make, their payments in full under their leases. As of December 31, 2019, we had an aggregate of approximately $2.7 million in lease rent and $3.8 million in maintenance reserve payments more than 30 days past due. Our inability to collect receivables or to repossess engines, aircraft or other leased equipment in the event of a default by a lessee could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe may not correctly assess the credit risk of each lessee or may not be in a position to charge risk-adjusted lease rates, and lessees may not be able to continue to perform their financial and other obligations under our leases in the future. A delayed, reduced or missed rental payment from a lessee decreases our revenues and cash flow and may adversely affect our ability to make payments on our indebtedness or to comply with financial covenants in our loan documents (see \u201cOur Financing Facilities Impose Restrictions on our Operations\u201d). While we typically experience some level of delinquency under our leases, default levels may increase over time, particularly as our portfolio of engines and aircraft ages and if economic conditions deteriorate.\nVarious airlines have filed for bankruptcy in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, with some seeking to restructure their operations and others ceasing operations entirely. In the case of airlines that are restructuring, such airlines often reduce their flights or eliminate the use of certain types of aircraft and the related engine types. Applicable bankruptcy laws often allow these airlines to terminate leases early and to return our engines or aircraft without meeting the contractual return conditions. In that case, we may not be paid the full amount, or any part, of our claims for these lease terminations. Alternatively, we might negotiate agreements with those airlines under which the airline continues to lease the engine or aircraft, but under modified lease terms. If requests for payment restructuring or rescheduling are made and granted, reduced or deferred rental payments may be payable over all or some part of the remaining term of the lease, although the terms of any revised payment schedules may be unfavorable and such payments may not be made. In the case of an airline which has ceased operations entirely, in addition to the risk of nonpayment, we face the enhanced risk of deterioration or total loss of an engine or aircraft while it is under uncertain custody and control. In that case, we may be required to take legal action to secure the return of the engine or aircraft and its records or, alternatively, to negotiate a settlement under which we can immediately recover the engine or aircraft and its records in exchange for waiving subsequent legal claims.\nWe may not be able to repossess an engine or aircraft when the lessee defaults, and even if we are able to repossess the engine or aircraft, we may have to expend significant funds in the repossession, remarketing and leasing of the asset.\nWhen a lessee defaults and such default is not cured in a timely manner we typically seek to terminate the lease and repossess the engine or aircraft. If a defaulting lessee contests the termination and repossession or is under court protection, enforcement of our rights under the lease may be difficult, expensive and time-consuming. We may not realize any practical benefits from our legal rights and we may need to obtain consents to export the engine or aircraft. As a result, the relevant asset may be off-lease or not producing revenue for a prolonged period. In addition, we will incur direct costs associated with repossessing our engine or aircraft. These costs may include legal and similar costs, the direct costs of transporting, storing and insuring the engine or aircraft, and costs associated with necessary maintenance and recordkeeping to make the asset available for lease or sale. During this time, we will realize no revenue from the leased engine or aircraft, and we will continue to be obligated to pay any debt financing applicable to the asset. If an engine is installed on an airframe, the airframe may be owned by an aircraft lessor or other third party. Our ability to recover engines installed on airframes may depend on the cooperation of the airframe owner.\nRisks Related to Our Orders of New Engines\nWe have committed to purchase new engines in 2020 with an aggregate value of up to $104.4 million. Our ability to lease these assets on favorable terms, if at all, may be adversely affected by risks to the commercial airline industry generally. If we are unable to obtain commitments for the remaining deliveries or otherwise satisfy our contractual obligations to the engine manufacturers, we will be subject to several potential risks, including:\n\u2022\nforfeiting advance deposits, as well as incurring certain significant costs related to these commitments such as contractual damages and legal, accounting and financial advisory expenses;\n\u2022\ndefaulting on any future lease commitments we may have entered into with respect to these engines, which could result in monetary damages and strained relationships with lessees;\n\u2022\nfailing to realize the benefits of purchasing and leasing the engines; and\n\u2022\nrisking harm to our business reputation, which would make it more difficult to purchase and lease engines in the future on agreeable terms, if at all.\nRisks Relating to Our Capital Structure\nOur future growth and profitability will depend on our ability to acquire aviation equipment and make other strategic investments. As a result, our inability to obtain sufficient capital to finance these acquisitions would constrain our ability to grow our portfolio and to increase our revenues.\nOur business is capital intensive and highly leveraged. Accordingly, our ability to successfully execute our business strategy and maintain our operations depends on the availability and cost of debt and equity capital. Additionally, our ability to borrow against our portfolio of engines, aircraft and strategic investments is dependent, in part, on the appraised value of such engines, aircraft and investments. If the appraised value of our portfolio declines, we may be required to either refrain from borrowings or reduce the principal outstanding under certain of our debt facilities.\nA significant increase in our cost to acquire engines and aircraft, or in our cost of strategic investments, due to increased interest expense or cost of capital will make it more difficult for us to make accretive acquisitions. The disruptions may also adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our continued growth. Although we have adequate debt commitments from our lenders, assuming they are willing and able to meet their contractual obligation to lend to us, market disruptions may adversely affect our ability to raise additional equity capital to fund future growth, requiring us to rely on internally generated funds. This would lower our rate of capital investment.\nWe can give no assurance that the capital we need will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. Our inability to obtain sufficient capital, or to renew or expand our credit facilities, could result in increased funding costs and would limit our ability to:\n\u2022\nmeet the terms and maturities of our existing and future debt facilities;\n\u2022\nadd new equipment to our portfolio;\n\u2022\nfund our working capital needs and maintain adequate liquidity; and\n\u2022\nfinance other growth initiatives.\nOur financing facilities impose restrictions on our operations.\nWe have, and expect to continue to have, various credit and financing arrangements with third parties. These financing arrangements are secured by all or substantially all of our assets. Our existing credit and financing arrangements require us to meet certain financial condition tests. Our revolving credit facility prohibits our purchasing or redeeming stock, or declaring or paying dividends on shares of any class or series of our common or preferred stock if an event of default under such facility has or will occur and remains uncured. The agreements governing our debt, including the issuance of notes by WEST II, WEST III and WEST IV, also include restrictive financial covenants. A breach of those and other covenants could, unless waived or amended by our creditors, result in a cross-default to other indebtedness and an acceleration of all or substantially all of our debt. We have obtained such waivers and amendments to our financing agreements in the past, but we cannot provide any assurance that we will receive such waivers or amendments in the future if we require them. If our outstanding debt is accelerated at any time, we likely would have little or no cash or other assets available after payment of our debts, which could cause the value or market price of our outstanding equity securities to decline significantly and we would have few, if any, assets available for distributions to our equity holders in liquidation.\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk on our leases, which could have a negative impact on our margins.\nWe are affected by fluctuations in interest rates. Our lease rates are generally fixed, and a portion of our debt bears variable rate interest based on one-month London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), so changes in interest rates directly affect our lease margins. From time to time, we seek to reduce our interest rate volatility and uncertainty through hedging with interest rate derivative contracts with respect to a portion of our debt. Our lease margins, as well as our earnings and cash flows may be adversely affected by increases in interest rates. To the extent we do not have hedges or other derivatives in place or if our hedges or other derivatives do not mitigate our interest rate exposure from an economic standpoint, we would be adversely affected by increasing interest rates. As reported by Intercontinental Exchange, the one-month LIBOR was approximately 1.76% and 2.50% on December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.\nChanges in the method of determining LIBOR, or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect interest rates on our current or future indebtedness and may otherwise adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain of our indebtedness is made at variable interest rates that use LIBOR (or metrics derived from or related to LIBOR), as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. These reforms may cause LIBOR to cease to exist, new methods of calculating LIBOR to be established, or alternative reference rates to be established. The potential consequences cannot be fully predicted and could have an adverse impact on the market value for or value of LIBOR-linked securities, loans, and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us. Changes in market interest rates may influence our financing costs, returns on financial investments and the valuation of derivative contracts and could reduce our earnings and cash flows. In addition, any transition process may involve, among other things, increased volatility or illiquidity in markets for instruments that rely on LIBOR, reductions in the value of certain instruments or the effectiveness of related transactions such as hedges, increased borrowing costs, uncertainty under applicable documentation, or difficult and costly consent processes. This could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity. We cannot predict the effect of the potential changes to LIBOR or the establishment and use of alternative rates or benchmarks.\nAn increase in interest rates or in our borrowing margin would increase the cost of servicing our debt and could reduce our profitability.\nA significant portion of our outstanding debt bears interest at floating rates. As a result, to the extent we have not hedged against rising interest rates, an increase in the applicable benchmark interest rates would increase our cost of servicing our debt and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nIn addition, we regularly refinance our indebtedness. If interest rates or our borrowing margins increase between the time an existing financing arrangement was consummated and the time such financing arrangement is refinanced, the cost of servicing our debt would increase and our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have risks in managing our portfolio of engines to meet customer needs.\nThe relatively long life cycles of aircraft and jet engines can be shortened by world events, government regulation or customer preferences. We seek to manage these risks by trying to anticipate demand for particular engine and aircraft types, maintaining a portfolio mix of engines that we believe is diversified and that will have long-term value and will be sought by lessees in the global market for jet engines, and by selling engines and aircraft that we expect will experience obsolescence or declining usefulness in the foreseeable future.\nThe WEST II securitization facility includes restrictions and limitations on the sale of engines in that facility including, among others, that (i) the net proceeds from any individual engine sale must be at least 105% of the debt allocated under the facility to that engine, and (ii) the aggregate appraised value of the facility\u2019s engines sold through September 2019 cannot exceed 20% of the total appraised value of the facility\u2019s engines at the inception of the facility plus the value of capitalized modifications to the engines since then, and cannot exceed 30% thereafter. We can give no assurance that we can successfully manage our engine portfolio to reduce these risks.\nThe WEST III securitization facility includes restrictions and limitations on the sale of assets in that facility including, with respect to pro forma limitations on assets subject to part-out agreements, a 15% limitation on sales prior to August 2019 and 20% thereafter, and also, in certain situations, with respect to a 25% limit on assets sold below a specific dollar threshold.\nThe WEST IV securitization facility includes restrictions and limitations on the sale of assets in that facility including, with respect to pro forma limitations on assets subject to part-out agreements, a 15% limitation on sales prior to August 2020 and 20% thereafter, and also, in certain situations, with respect to a 25% limit on assets sold below a specific dollar threshold.\nOur inability to maintain sufficient liquidity could limit our operational flexibility and also impact our ability to make payments on our obligations as they come due.\nIn addition to being capital intensive and highly leveraged, our business also requires that we maintain sufficient liquidity to enable us to contribute the non-financed portion of engine and aircraft purchases as well as to service our payment obligations to our creditors as they become due, despite the fact that the timing and amounts of payments under our leases do not match the timing under our debt service obligations. Our restricted cash is unavailable for general corporate purposes. Accordingly, our ability to successfully execute our business strategy and maintain our operations depends on our ability to continue to maintain sufficient liquidity, cash and available credit under our credit facilities. Our liquidity could be adversely impacted if we are subjected to one or more of the following: a significant decline in lease revenues, a material increase in interest expense that is not matched by a corresponding increase in lease rates, a significant increase in operating expenses, or a reduction in our available credit under our credit facilities. If we do not maintain sufficient liquidity, our ability to meet our payment obligations to creditors or to borrow additional funds could become impaired as could our ability to make dividend payments or other distributions to our equity holders. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nRISKS RELATING TO THE COMMON STOCK TRADING PRICE\nThe Company\u2019s Common Stock trading price may be affected by numerous factors that may impose a financial risk on the Company\u2019s stockholders.\nThe trading price of our common stock may fluctuate due to many factors, including:\n\u2022\nrisks relating to our business described in this Annual Report;\n\u2022\nsales of our securities by a few stockholders or even a single significant stockholder;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting mandated under GAAP;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nour financial condition, performance and prospects;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates by us;\n\u2022\nthe level, direction and volatility of interest rates and expectations of changes in rates;\n\u2022\nthe market for securities similar to our common stock; and\n\u2022\nchanges in our capital structure, including additional issuances by us of debt or equity securities.\nIn addition, the U.S. stock markets have experienced price and volume volatility that has affected many companies\u2019 stock prices, often for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of those companies.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS\nA substantial portion of our lease revenue comes from foreign customers, subjecting us to divergent regulatory requirements.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, 79% of our lease revenue was generated by leases to foreign customers. Such international leases present risks to us because certain foreign laws, regulations and judicial procedures may not be as protective of lessor rights as those which apply in the United States. We are also subject to risks of foreign laws that affect the timing and access to courts and may limit our remedies when collecting lease payments and recovering assets. None of our leased engines have been expropriated; however, we can give no assurance that political instability abroad and changes in the policies of foreign nations will not present expropriation risks in the future that are not covered by insurance.\nSubstantially all of our leases require payments in U.S. dollars but many of our customers operate in other currencies; if foreign currencies devalue against the U.S. dollar, our lessees may be unable to make their payments to us.\nSubstantially all of our current leases require that payments be made in U.S. dollars. If the currency that our lessees typically use in operating their businesses devalues against the U.S. dollar, those lessees could encounter difficulties in making payments in U.S. dollars. Furthermore, many foreign countries have currency and exchange laws regulating international payments that may impede or prevent payments from being paid to us in U.S. dollars. Future leases may provide for payments to be made in euros or other foreign currencies. Any change in the currency exchange rate that reduces the amount of U.S. dollars obtained by us upon conversion of future lease payments denominated in euros or other foreign currencies, may, if not appropriately hedged by us, have a material adverse effect on us and increase the volatility of our earnings. If payments on our leases are made in foreign currency, our risks and hedging costs will increase.\nWe operate globally and are affected by our customers\u2019 local and regional economic and other risks.\nWe believe that our customers\u2019 growth and financial condition are driven by economic growth in their service areas. The largest portion of our lease revenues comes from Europe. European airline operations are among the most heavily regulated in the world. At the same time, low-cost carriers have exerted substantial competitive and financial pressure on major European airlines. Low-cost carriers are having similar effects in North America and elsewhere.\nOur operations may also be affected by political or economic instability in the areas where we have customers.\nWe may not be able to enforce our rights as a creditor if a lessee files for bankruptcy outside of the United States.\nWhen a debtor seeks protection under the United States Bankruptcy Code, creditors are automatically stayed from enforcing their rights. In the case of United States-certificated airlines, Section 1110 of the Bankruptcy Code provides certain relief to lessors of aircraft equipment. Section 1110 has been the subject of significant litigation and we can give no assurance that Section 1110 will protect our investment in aircraft or engines in the event of a lessee\u2019s bankruptcy. In addition, Section 1110 does not apply to lessees located outside of the United States and applicable foreign laws may not provide comparable protection.\nLiens on our engines or aircraft could exceed the value of such assets, which could negatively affect our ability to repossess, lease or sell a particular engine or aircraft.\nLiens that secure the payment of repairers\u2019 charges or other liens may, depending on the jurisdiction, attach to engines and aircraft. Engines also may be installed on airframes to which liens unrelated to the engines have attached. These liens may secure substantial sums that may, in certain jurisdictions or for limited types of liens, exceed the value of the particular engine or aircraft to which the liens have attached. In some jurisdictions, a lien may give the holder the right to detain or, in limited cases, sell or cause the forfeiture of the engine or aircraft. Such liens may have priority over our interest as well as our creditors\u2019 interest in the engines or aircraft, either because they have such priority under applicable local law or because our creditors\u2019 security interests are not filed in jurisdictions outside the United States. These liens and lien holders could impair our ability to repossess and lease or sell the engines or aircraft. We cannot give assurance that our lessees will comply with their obligations to discharge third-party liens on our assets. If they do not, we may, in the future, find it necessary to pay the claims secured by such liens to repossess such assets.\nIn certain countries, an engine affixed to an aircraft may become an accession to the aircraft and we may not be able to exercise our ownership rights over the engine.\nIn some jurisdictions, an engine affixed to an aircraft may become an accession to the aircraft, so that the ownership rights of the owner of the aircraft supersede the ownership rights of the owner of the engine. If an aircraft is security for the owner\u2019s obligations to a third-party, the security interest in the aircraft may supersede our rights as owner of the engine. This legal principle could limit our ability to repossess an engine in the event of a lessee bankruptcy or lease default while the aircraft with the engine installed remains in such a jurisdiction. We may suffer a loss if we are not able to repossess engines leased to lessees in these jurisdictions.\nChanges to trade policy, tariff, sanction and import/export regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in U.S. or international, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade and investment in the territories or countries where we currently conduct our business, could adversely affect our business. The executive branch of the United States government has instituted or proposed changes in trade policies that include the negotiation or termination of trade agreements, the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the U.S., economic sanctions on corporations or countries, and other government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries that will affect the manner in which we conduct our business. Trading partners of the United States have also implemented and threatened to implement retaliatory tariffs and/or other impediments to trade.\nAs a result of new or threatened tariffs, sanctions and/or impediments to trade, both from the United States and other countries, there may be greater restrictions and economic disincentives on international trade. The new or threatened tariffs, sanctions and other changes in trade policy could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, and certain foreign governments have instituted or are considering imposing tariffs and/or economic sanctions on certain U.S. goods. We do a significant amount of business that would be impacted by changes to the trade policies of the U.S. and foreign countries (including governmental action related to tariffs, international trade agreements, or economic sanctions). Such changes have the potential to adversely impact the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof, our industry and the global demand for our products and services, and as a result, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe effects of the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d), including trade agreements, are not yet known and the uncertainty creates challenges and risks which may adversely affect our business.\nOn June 23, 2016, the UK voted in favor of a referendum to leave the European Union, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d and the UK ceased to be a member of the European Union on January 31, 2020. A transition period through December 31, 2020 has been established to allow the UK and the European Union to negotiate the terms of the UK\u2019s withdrawal. However, there is continued uncertainty surrounding the future relationship between the UK and European, including any trade agreements between them, which could adversely affect European and worldwide economic and market conditions, and contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the United Kingdom determines which European Laws to replace or replicate. The ultimate effects of Brexit will depend on the specific terms of any agreement the UK and the European Union reach to provide access to each other\u2019s respective markets.\nWe have a presence in certain European Union countries, including Ireland, England, Wales and France. During 2019, we derived approximately 79% of our core leasing revenue from international business. The consequences of Brexit could introduce significant uncertainties into global financial markets and adversely impact the markets in which we and our customers operate.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR SMALL SIZE AND CORPORATE STRUCTURE\nIntense competition in our industry, particularly with major companies with substantially greater financial, personnel, marketing and other resources, could cause our revenues and business to suffer.\nThe engine and aircraft leasing industry is highly competitive and global. Our primary competitors include GE Capital Aviation Services, Shannon Engine Support Ltd., Pratt &Whitney, Rolls-Royce Partners Finance and Engine Lease Finance Corporation.\nOur primary competitors generally have significantly greater financial, personnel and other resources, as well as a physical presence in more locations, than we do. In addition, competing engine lessors may have lower costs of capital and may provide financial or technical services or other inducements to customers, including the ability to sell or lease aircraft, offer maintenance and repair services or provide other forms of financing that we do not provide. We cannot give assurance that we will be able to compete effectively or that competitive pressures will not adversely affect us.\nThere is no organized market for the spare engines or the aircraft we purchase. Typically, we purchase engines and aircraft from commercial aircraft operators, engine manufacturers, MROs and other suppliers. We rely on our representatives, advertisements and reputation to generate opportunities to purchase and sell engines and aircraft. The market for purchasing engine and aircraft portfolios is highly competitive, generally involving an auction bidding process. We can give no assurance that engines and aircraft will continue to be available to us on acceptable terms and in the types and quantities we seek consistent with the diversification requirements of our debt facilities and our portfolio diversification goals.\nSubstantially all of our assets are pledged to our creditors.\nSubstantially all of our assets are pledged to secure our obligations to creditors. Our revolving credit banks have a lien on all of our assets, including our residual interests in WEST II, WEST III and WEST IV. Due to WEST II\u2019s, WEST III\u2019s and WEST IV\u2019s bankruptcy remote structure, that interest is subject to the prior payments of WEST II\u2019s, WEST III\u2019s and WEST IV\u2019s debt and other obligations. Therefore, our rights and the rights of our creditors to participate in any distribution of the assets of WEST II, WEST III and WEST IV upon liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or winding up will be subject to the prior claims of WEST II\u2019s, WEST III\u2019s and WEST IV\u2019s creditors. Similarly, the rights of our shareholders are subject to satisfaction of the claims of our lenders and other creditors.\nWe may be unable to manage the expansion of our operations.\nWe can give no assurance that we will be able to manage effectively the current and potential expansion of our operations, or that if we are successful expanding our operations that our systems, procedures or controls will be adequate to support our operations, in which event our business, financial condition, results and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nAny acquisition or expansion involves various risks, which may include some or all of the following:\n\u2022\nincurring or assuming additional debt;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s time and attention from ongoing business operations;\n\u2022\nfuture charges to earnings related to the possible impairment of goodwill and the write down of other intangible assets;\n\u2022\nrisks of unknown or contingent liabilities;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the assimilation of operations, services, products and personnel;\n\u2022\nunanticipated costs and delays;\n\u2022\nrisk that the acquired business does not perform consistently with our growth and profitability expectations;\n\u2022\nrisk that growth will strain our infrastructure, staff, internal controls and management, which may require additional personnel, time and expenditures; and\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees and customers.\nAny of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on us.\nCompliance with the regulatory requirements imposed on us as a public company results in significant costs that may have an adverse effect on our results.\nAs a public company, we are subject to various regulatory requirements including, but not limited to, compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. Compliance with these regulations results in significant additional costs to us both directly, through increased audit and consulting fees, and indirectly, through the time required by our limited resources to address such regulations. We have complied with Section 404a of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act since December 31, 2007, completing our annual assessment of internal controls over financial reporting. We have complied with Section 404b of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act since December 31, 2009, and our independent registered public accounting firm audits our internal controls over financial reporting. Such compliance requires us to incur additional costs on audit and consulting fees and requires additional management time that may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to governmental regulation and our failure to comply with these regulations could cause the government to withdraw or revoke our authorizations and approvals to do business and could subject us to penalties and sanctions that could harm our business.\nGovernmental agencies throughout the world, including the FAA, highly regulate the manufacture, repair and operation of all aircraft operated in the United States and equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries, such as the EASA in Europe, regulate aircraft operated in those countries. We include, with the aircraft, engines and related parts that we purchase, lease and sell to our customers, documentation certifying that each part complies with applicable regulatory requirements and meets applicable standards of airworthiness established by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries. Specific regulations vary from country to country, although regulatory requirements in other countries are generally satisfied by compliance with FAA requirements. With respect to a particular engine or engine component, we utilize FAA and/or EASA certified repair stations to repair and certify engines and components to ensure marketability. The revocation or suspension of any of our material authorizations or approvals would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. New and more stringent government regulations, if adopted and enacted, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, certain product sales to foreign countries require approval or licensing from the U.S. government. Denial of export licenses could reduce our sales to those countries and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are effectively controlled by one principal stockholder, who has the power to contest the outcome of most matters submitted to the stockholders for approval and to affect our stock prices adversely if he were to sell substantial amounts of his common stock.\nCharles F. Willis, IV is the founder of WLFC, has served as Chief Executive Officer and a Director since our incorporation in 1985, served as President until July 2011, and has served as Chairman of the Board of Directors since 1996. Mr. Willis has over 45 years of experience in the aviation industry which includes serving as President of Willis Lease\u2019s predecessor, Charles F. Willis Company, which purchased, financed and sold a variety of large commercial transport aircraft and provided consulting services to the aviation industry, Assistant Vice President of Sales at Seaboard World Airlines, a freight carrier, and various positions at Alaska Airlines, including positions in the flight operations, sales and marketing departments. As our founder and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Willis brings to the Board significant senior leadership, sales and marketing, industry, technical and global experience, as well as a deep institutional knowledge of the Company, its operations and customer relations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, Mr. Willis beneficially owned or had the ability to direct the voting of 2,925,211 shares of our common stock, representing approximately 46% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. As a result, Mr. Willis effectively controls us and has the power to contest the outcome of substantially all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of our board of directors. In addition, future sales by Mr. Willis of substantial amounts of our common stock, or the potential for such sales, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nIf the negotiation over a possible \u201ctake-private\u201d transaction involving our company is not completed, our business could be harmed and our stock price could decline.\nSince June 2019, an independent committee established by our board of directors has been reviewing and negotiating proposals from our Chief Executive Officer and largest investor and our Senior Vice President, Corporate Development to acquire the Company pursuant to a merger that would result in our becoming a privately-held company, or the \u201cpotential transaction.\u201d While the parties are negotiating in good faith a potential transaction, a complete proposal has not been submitted for consideration by the independent committee, including indicative financing terms, and there can be no assurance regarding the terms and details of any transaction, that any future proposal will be made, that any proposal will be accepted by the independent committee or that any take-private transaction will ultimately be consummated. If the negotiations cease or the potential transaction is terminated, the market price of our common stock will likely decline since it may reflect the publicly disclosed prices communicated to independent committee over the course of negotiations. In addition, our stock price may decline as a result of the fact that we have incurred and will continue to incur significant expenses related to the potential transaction prior to its execution or closing that will not be recovered if the potential transaction is not completed. As a consequence of the failure of the potential transaction to be completed, as well as of some or all of these potential effects of the termination\nof the potential transaction, our business could be harmed in that concerns about our viability are likely to increase, making it more difficult to retain employees and existing customers and to generate new business.\nThe possibility of an imminent \u201ctake-private\u201d transaction could harm our business, revenue and results of operations.\nWhile negotiations with the independent committee are continuing and potential transaction appears to be imminent, it creates uncertainty about our future. As a result of this uncertainty, customers may decide to delay, defer, or cancel purchases of our products pending completion of the potential transaction or termination of the potential transaction. If these decisions represent a significant portion of our anticipated revenue, our results of operations and quarterly revenues could be substantially below the expectations of investors.\nIn addition, while negotiations are ongoing and the potential transaction appears to be imminent, we are subject to a number of risks that may harm our business, revenue and results of operations, including:\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management and employee attention and the unavoidable disruption to our relationships with customers and vendors may detract from our ability to grow revenues and minimize costs;\n\u2022\nwe have and will continue to incur significant expenses related to the potential transaction prior to its completion; and\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to respond effectively to competitive pressures, industry developments and future opportunities.\nOur business might suffer if we were to lose the services of certain key employees.\nOur business operations depend upon our key employees, including our executive officers. Loss of any of these employees, particularly our Chief Executive Officer, could have a material adverse effect on our business as our key employees have knowledge of our industry and customers and would be difficult to replace.\nWe are the servicer and administrative agent for the WEST II, WEST III and WEST IV facilities and our cash flows would be materially and adversely affected if we were removed from these positions.\nWe are the servicer and administrative agent with respect to engines in the WEST II, WEST III and WEST IV facilities. We receive monthly fees of 11.5% as servicer (3.5% of which is subordinated in the cases of WEST III and WEST IV) and 2.0% as administrative agent of the aggregate net rents actually received by WEST II, WEST III and WEST IV on their engines. We may be removed as servicer and or administrative agent of our WEST II, WEST III and WEST IV facilities by an affirmative vote of a requisite number of the WEST II, WEST III and WEST IV note holders. Such vote could happen upon the occurrence of certain specified events as outlined in the WEST II, WEST III and WEST IV servicing and administrative agency agreements.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with the financial covenants set forth in the WEST II, WEST III and WEST IV servicing and administrative agency agreements. There can be no assurance that we will be in compliance with these covenants in the future or will not otherwise be terminated as servicer or administrative agent for the WEST II, WEST III and WEST IV facilities. If we are removed from such role with those facilities, our expenses would increase as our consolidated variable interest entities (\u201cVIE\u2019s\u201d) WEST II, WEST III and WEST IV, would have to hire an outside provider to replace the servicer and administrative agent functions, and we would be materially and adversely affected. Consequently, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely affected.\nProvisions in Delaware law and our charter and bylaws might prevent or delay a change of control.\nCertain provisions of law, our amended certificate of incorporation, bylaws and amended rights agreement could make the following more difficult: (1) an acquisition of us by means of a tender offer, a proxy contest or otherwise, and (2) the removal of incumbent officers and directors.\nOur board of directors has authorized the issuance of shares of 6.5% Series A Preferred Stock and 6.5% Series A-2 Preferred Stock, by us and to Development Bank of Japan Inc. (\u201cDBJ\u201d) with American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, serving as rights agent. The rights agreement could make it more difficult to proceed with and tends to discourage a merger, tender offer or proxy contest. Our amended certificate of incorporation also provides that stockholder action can be taken only at an annual or special meeting of stockholders and may not be taken by written consent and, in certain circumstances relating to acquisitions or other changes in control, requires an 80% super majority vote of all outstanding shares of our common stock. Our bylaws also limit the ability of stockholders to raise matters at a meeting of stockholders without giving advance notice.", "PERMNO": 83969, "SIC": 7359, "TIC": "WLFC"}
