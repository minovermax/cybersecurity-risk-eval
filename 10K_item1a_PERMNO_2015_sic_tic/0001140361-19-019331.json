Risk Factors\nIn addition to other information referenced in this report, we are subject to a number of specific risks, which are outlined below. If any of these events occur, our business, financial condition, profitability and the market price of our Class A Common Stock could be materially affected.\nRisk Factors Related to the Pending Merger\nOur business may be subject to uncertainties and other operating restrictions until completion of the Merger.\nIn connection with the pending Merger with WSP, our business may experience disruptions as customers, suppliers, and others may attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with other parties. Additionally, the Merger Agreement requires us to operate our business in the ordinary course pending consummation of the Merger and restricts us, subject to certain exceptions, including with WSP\u2019s consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), from taking certain specified actions until the Merger is completed. These restrictions may affect our ability to execute our business strategies and attain our financial and other goals and may impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may have difficulty attracting, motivating and retaining key employees during the pendency of the Merger.\nIn connection with the pending Merger, current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us following the Merger, which may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel while the Merger is pending. Key employees may depart because of the uncertainty or potential difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the combined company following the Merger.\nAlthough we are targeting completing the Merger in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2019, the expected timing for completion of the Merger could change and is uncertain.\nWe are targeting completing the Merger in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2019. However, the completion of the Merger remains subject to the satisfaction or waiver of specified closing conditions, including the Company Stockholder Approval and applicable regulatory approvals. In addition, certain other events that we do not have the ability to control, such as legal actions taken by or on behalf of our shareholders, may also affect the timing and/or likelihood of closing. While we believe we will receive the requisite approvals, there can be no assurance that these and other conditions to closing will be satisfied on the proposed terms and schedules as contemplated by the parties or at all. These and other conditions to the completion of the Merger may delay or preclude our ability to consummate the Merger. As a result, the Merger may not be completed until after that time, or at all, and the effect of the risks and constraints relating to the pending Merger may be increased if the timing for the completion of the Merger is extended or becomes more uncertain.\nIf the Merger is not completed, the Company will have incurred substantial costs that will adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results and operations.\nThe Company has incurred and will continue to incur substantial costs in connection with the Merger. The Company could be subject to litigation related to the Merger, which could result in significant costs and expenses. In addition to litigation-related expenses, the Company has incurred and will continue to incur costs and fees for professional services rendered in connection with the Merger. In addition, the Company has diverted significant management resources in an effort to complete the Merger and continues to do so. The Company is also subject to restrictions contained in the Merger Agreement on the conduct of the Company\u2019s business during the pendency of the Merger. If the Merger is not completed, the Company will have received little or no benefit with respect to such costs incurred and the restrictions on the Company\u2019s conduct during the pendency of the Merger. Moreover, the views of clients, vendors, employees and the financial markets as to the Company\u2019s business and prospects may be adversely impacted if the Merger is not completed, even if the reason for the failure of the Merger to be completed did not relate to the Company\u2019s business and prospects. Finally, matters relating to the pending Merger will require substantial commitment of time and resources by our management, which would otherwise have been devoted to day-to-day operations and developing opportunities that may have been beneficial to us as an independent company.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated, we may, under certain circumstances, be obligated to pay a termination fee to WSP.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated in certain circumstances, we may be required to pay WSP a termination fee of $4.0 million or reimburse WSP for certain expenses of up to $1.75 million. If the Merger Agreement is terminated, we may decide to pay the termination fee or the expense reimbursement from available cash that we would have otherwise used for general corporate purposes. For these and other reasons, a failed Merger could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows, or the price per share of our Class A Common Stock.\nRisk Factors Related to Our Markets and Clients\nChanges in environmental laws and regulations, or fundamental changes in the operations of government agencies, could reduce demand or impact the timing for our services.\nMost of our business is driven by laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment. The current U.S. government administration has declined to enforce some environmental laws and has repealed certain regulations, adversely impacting our ability to generate revenue. Any further relaxation or repeal of these laws, or changes in governmental policies regarding the funding or enforcement of these laws, may have additional adverse impacts on our revenue. Fundamental changes in the operations of government agencies (i.e., significant agency staff reductions, changes or delays in processes for awarding contracts, and decisions to shutdown portions of the U.S. federal government) also could impact the amount or timing of our revenue. Also, reduced spending by governmental agencies may increase competition within our industry which may directly affect future revenue and profits.\nAs a federal government contractor, we are subject to a number of procurement laws and regulations and government agency audits. Any violation of these laws could result in economic harm to our operations.\nRevenue from U.S. government contracts represented 16%, 17% and 23% of total revenue for fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nWe must comply with federal laws relating to the procurement and administration of government contracts. Federal laws include the Federal Acquisition Regulation (\u201cFAR\u201d), the Truth in Negotiations Act, the Cost Accounting Standards (\u201cCAS\u201d), and the Service Contract Act. These laws impact how we do business with government clients and can increase the cost of doing business. In addition, in recent years, government agencies have mandated that their primary contractors utilize a higher portion of small and disadvantaged businesses as subcontractors.\nCertain federal government agencies, such as EPA and the Defense Contract Audit Agency (\u201cDCAA\u201d), as well as numerous state agencies, routinely audit government contractors and their performance under specific contracts to determine if a contractor\u2019s cost structure is compliant with applicable laws and regulations. They may question the incurrence of certain costs based on the FAR and CAS and disallow those costs on their contracts. These audits may occur several years after payment for services has been received. Historically, we have been able to successfully defend against the disallowance of any significant costs. However, future audits may uncover instances of noncompliance and result in material disallowances for costs previously incurred. Such material disallowances could negatively affect revenue, profits and cash flow.\nWe depend on municipal, state and federal government work for a significant portion of our revenue. Inability to win or renew government contracts during procurement cycles could significantly reduce our revenue and profits.\nGovernment contracts are typically awarded through a highly regulated procurement process. Some government contracts are awarded to multiple competitors, causing increased competition and downward pricing pressure. Inability to win or renew government contracts could adversely affect our operations and significantly reduce our revenue and profits. In addition, if we cannot reduce or control costs associated with these contracts, we may not be able to bid competitively, or unexpected losses on these contracts may occur.\nOur commercial clients may be acquired by other entities or may elect to sell their interest in ongoing projects to other entities. These transactions would subject us to increased risk of contract terminations or renegotiations.\nIf our commercial clients sell their interest in ongoing projects or are acquired by other entities, we may not be able to control or influence decisions made by the acquiring company regarding the ongoing contractual relationships of our client, including decisions to modify contracts to mitigate conflict of interest, terminate existing contracts or to award future contracts. Such decisions by acquiring companies to terminate existing contracts, or to exclude us when awarding future contracts, could have an adverse impact on our revenues and results of operations. Additionally, poor global and domestic economic conditions could impact the availability of funding for certain private environmental projects causing significant delay or cancellation of projects.\nFailure to retain or renew significant contracts with certain government and key commercial clients.\nSeveral factors can impact our ability to retain or renew significant contracts, including completion of projects in the normal course of business, transfers of ownership of our clients or their projects and client acceptance of novation of our contracts if we are acquired by, or merged with, another company. Our failure to maintain contracts that contribute a material amount to our annual revenue could significantly reduce our income and profits if we are unable to enter into more or other contracts with new clients for similar values within the fiscal year.\nRisk Factors Related to Our Operations\nOur South American operations are subject to a number of risks.\nGross revenue from our South American operations represented 20%, 21% and 16% of consolidated gross revenue for fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Compared with our U.S. operations, our South American operations are subject to a number of heightened risks, including:\n\u2022\nforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\nexposure to liability and sanctions under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u2022\nexposure to liability and sanctions under laws and regulations established by foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business; and\n\u2022\nvolatility in economic and political conditions.\nFailure to manage these risks effectively may result in a negative impact on our future revenue, earnings, financial position and liquidity.\nFailure to attract and retain key employees due to our current corporate reorganization and to our planned Merger with WSP could impair our ability to provide quality service to our clients.\nWe provide professional and technical services that depend on our ability to attract, retain and train our professional employees to conduct our business and perform our obligations to ensure success. Impacts from the Staff Reduction Programs (as defined in Item 7 of this Annual Report) and from our planned Merger with WSP may result in our senior management team and other key employees that are essential to our profitability and success leaving the Company, leaving us with insufficient experienced personnel to service our clients and run our operations. Failure to effectively develop staff and complete succession planning for key senior management roles could adversely affect customer relationships, the quality of work that we complete for our clients and business development efforts.\nFailure to appoint a permanent chief executive officer in a timely manner could have a detrimental impact on our corporate strategy and success.\nFailure to appoint a permanent chief executive officer with the desired level of experience and expertise, versus an executive chairman and operating committee leading the Company, in a timely manner may impact employee, client and shareholder confidence in the Company\u2019s ability to have and implement a consistent strategic plan to perform and prosper, which could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nExtraordinary events, including natural disasters and terrorist actions, could negatively impact the economies in which we operate or disrupt our operations.\nThe geographic areas of our operations include regions that have experienced hurricanes, earthquakes and forest fires. The occurrence of extraordinary events such as these, as well as other natural disasters or terrorist actions, could cause the delay or cancellation of projects, closure of offices, and the evacuation or loss of personnel. Such events could limit or disrupt markets and our operations, which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations or cash flows.\nFailure to establish and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting has resulted in, and may in the future result in, material misstatements in our financial statements.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting. Management concluded that our controls over financial reporting were not effective as of July 31, 2018 due to material weaknesses related to the Company\u2019s accounting for its majority investment in GAC, income taxes and the financial statement close process. Although we believe that we effectively remediated these material weaknesses during fiscal year 2019, implementation of measures to remediate these material weaknesses may prove to be ineffective or inadequate and the Company may still be exposed to risk of misstatements in its financial statements. Investors and other users of the Company\u2019s financial statements could lose confidence in the reliability of the Company\u2019s financial information. The Company could be obligated to incur additional costs to improve the Company\u2019s internal controls, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation and its operating prospects. Further, if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal controls are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material errors and misstatements, and we could be required to restate financial results reported in prior periods.\nInternal information technology systems or service failures could disrupt our business and impair our ability to effectively provide our services and products to our clients, which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our revenue, profitability and operating results.\nOur information technology systems are subject to potential failures, including network, software or hardware failures, whether caused by us, third-party service providers, intruders or hackers, computer viruses, natural disasters, power shortages or terrorist attacks. Any such failures could cause loss of data and interruptions or delays in our business, cause us to incur remediation costs, subject us to claims and damage our reputation. Failure or disruption of our communications or utilities could cause us to interrupt or suspend our operations or otherwise adversely affect our business. Any system or service disruptions if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated could have a material adverse effect on our business including, among other things, an adverse effect on our ability to bill our clients for work performed on our contracts, collect the amounts that have been billed and produce accurate financial statements in a timely manner. Our property and business interruption insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur as a result of any system or operational failure or disruption and, as a result, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We have invested and will continue to pursue further investments in systems that will allow us to achieve and remain in compliance with the regulations governing our business; however, there can be no assurance that such systems will be effective at achieving and maintaining compliance or that we will not incur additional costs in order to make such systems effective.\nRisk Factors Related to Ownership and Corporate Governance\nVoting rights of certain directors could block or discourage a change in control.\nTwo of EEI\u2019s current directors owned or controlled approximately 41% of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock as of October 4, 2019. Each share of EEI\u2019s outstanding Class B Common Stock has one vote, while each share of Class A Common Stock is equivalent to one-tenth of a vote. In addition, since the Company qualifies for the Nasdaq \u201ccontrolled company exception,\u201d there exists a group of holders of Class B Common Stock, composed principally of certain of the Company\u2019s current directors and executive officers and members of their families (the \u201cCCE Group\u201d), that controls greater than 50% of the votes that may be cast for any proposal at a shareholders meeting. This concentration of voting control by the CCE Group may effectively prevent any influence by other holders of Class A or Class B Common Stock over matters submitted to a vote by all shareholders.\nAs a result, the CCE Group has effective control over the outcome of votes on all matters requiring approval by a majority of the outstanding shares of stock held by our shareholders, including significant corporate transactions such as mergers, tender offers and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets. The interests of the CCE Group could conflict with or differ from the Company\u2019s interests or the interests of other shareholders. For example, the concentration of ownership held by the CCE Group could discourage, delay, defer or prevent a change of control of the Company or impede a merger, takeover or other business combination which may otherwise be favorable for us or the Company\u2019s other shareholders.", "PERMNO": 71837, "SIC": 8711, "TIC": "EEI"}
