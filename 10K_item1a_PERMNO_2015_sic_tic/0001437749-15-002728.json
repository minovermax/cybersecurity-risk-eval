{"cik": "1030749", "company": "GULFMARK OFFSHORE INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-17", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nWe rely on the oil and natural gas industry, and volatile oil and natural gas prices impact demand for our services.\nDemand for our services depends on activity in offshore oil and natural gas exploration, development and production. The level of exploration, development and production activity is affected by factors such as:\n\u25cf\nprevailing oil and natural gas prices;\n\u25cf\nexpectations about future prices and price volatility;\n\u25cf\ncost of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf\nsale and expiration dates of available offshore leases;\n\u25cf\ndemand for petroleum products;\n\u25cf\ncurrent availability of oil and natural gas resources;\n\u25cf\nrate of discovery of new oil and natural gas reserves in offshore areas;\n\u25cf\nlocal and international political, environmental and economic conditions;\n\u25cf\nchanges in laws and regulations;\n\u25cf\ntechnological advances; and\n\u25cf\nability of oil and natural gas companies to obtain leases and permits, or obtain funds for capital.\nThe level of offshore exploration, development and production activity has historically been characterized by volatility. A decline in exploration and development of offshore areas may result in a decline in the demand for our offshore marine services. Any such decrease in activity is likely to reduce our day rates and our utilization rates and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe volatility in oil and gas prices and disruptions in the credit markets and general economy may adversely impact our business.\nAs a result of volatility in oil and natural gas prices and ongoing uncertainty of the global economic environment, we are unable to determine whether customers will reduce spending on exploration and development drilling or whether customers and/or vendors and suppliers will be able to access financing necessary to sustain their current level of operations, fulfill their commitments and/or fund future operations and obligations. The current global economic environment may impact industry fundamentals and impact our customers\u2019 abilities to pay for the services of our vessels. The potential resulting decrease in demand for offshore services could cause the industry to cycle into a prolonged downturn. These conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe recent decline in the price of oil has impacted the operational plans for many of the major oil companies and consequently has affected the drilling and support services sector. If rig contracts are delayed or suspended in any of the regions where we operate, it will directly impact vessel demand in the region. In early 2015, we have experienced a negative impact on day rates and utilization, but cannot predict the length or severity of the decline.\nAn increase in the supply of offshore supply vessels would likely have a negative effect on charter rates for our vessels, which could reduce our earnings.\nCharter rates for marine supply vessels depend in part on the supply of the vessels. We could experience a reduction in demand as a result of an increased supply of vessels. Excess vessel capacity in the industry or a particular offshore market may result from:\n\u25cf\nconstructing new vessels;\n\u25cf\nmoving vessels from one offshore market area to another;\n\u25cf\nconverting vessels formerly dedicated to services other than offshore marine services; or\n\u25cf\ndeclining offshore oil and gas drilling production activities.\nIn the last ten years, construction of vessels of the types we operate has increased. Significant new OSV construction and upgrades of existing OSVs could intensify price competition. The resulting increases in OSV supply could be sufficient to depress OSV utilization and intensify price competition from both existing competitors, as well as new entrants into the offshore vessel supply market. As of the date of this report, not all of the vessels currently under construction have been contracted for future work, which may further intensify price competition as scheduled delivery dates occur. Such price competition could reduce day rates, utilization rates and operating margins, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nGovernment regulation and environmental risks can reduce our business opportunities, increase our costs, and adversely affect the manner or feasibility of doing business.\nWe and our customers are subject to extensive governmental regulation in the form of international conventions, federal, state and local laws and laws and regulations in jurisdictions where our vessels operate and are registered. The risks of incurring substantial compliance costs, liabilities and penalties for noncompliance are inherent in offshore marine services operations. Compliance with the Jones Act, as well as with environmental, occupational, health and safety, and vessel and port security laws can reduce our business opportunities and increase our costs of doing business. Additionally, these laws change frequently. Therefore, we are unable to predict with certainty the future costs or other future impact of these laws on our operations and our customers. We could also incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines, civil or criminal sanctions and third party claims for property damage or personal injury as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws and regulations. In addition, there can be no assurance that we can avoid significant costs, liabilities and penalties imposed on us as a result of government regulation in the future.\nFailure to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws may have an adverse effect on us.\nOur international operations require us to comply with a number of U.S. and international laws and regulations, including those involving anti-bribery and anti-corruption. We do business and may do additional business in the future in countries and regions where strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may not be customary. In order to effectively operate in certain foreign jurisdictions, circumstances may require that we establish joint ventures with local operators or find strategic partners. As a U.S. corporation, we are subject to the regulations imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or obtaining an improper business benefit. We have an ongoing program of proactive procedures to promote compliance with the FCPA and other similar anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, but we may be held liable for actions taken by our strategic or local partners or agents even though these partners or agents may not themselves be subjected to the FCPA or other similar laws. Our personnel and intermediaries, including our local operators and strategic partners, may face, directly or indirectly, corrupt demands by government officials, political parties and officials, tribal or insurgent organizations, or private entities in the countries in which we operate or may operate in the future. As a result, we face the risk that an unauthorized payment or offer of payment could be made by one of our employees or intermediaries, even if such parties are not always subject to our control or are not themselves subject to the FCPA or other similar laws to which we may be subject. Any allegation that we have violated the FCPA or other similar laws or any determination that we have violated the FCPA or other similar laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe are subject to hazards customary for the operation of vessels that could adversely affect our financial performance if we are not adequately insured or indemnified.\nOur operations are subject to various operating hazards and risks, including:\n\u25cf\ncatastrophic marine disaster;\n\u25cf\nadverse sea and weather conditions;\n\u25cf\nmechanical failure;\n\u25cf\nnavigation errors;\n\u25cf\ncollision;\n\u25cf\noil and hazardous substance spills, containment and clean up;\n\u25cf\nlabor shortages and strikes;\n\u25cf\ndamage to and loss of drilling rigs and production facilities; and\n\u25cf\nwar, sabotage, piracy , cyber-attack and terrorism risks.\nThese risks present a threat to the safety of our personnel and to our vessels, cargo, equipment under tow and other property, as well as the environment. We could be required to suspend our operations or request that others suspend their operations as a result of these hazards. In such event, we would experience loss of revenue and possibly property damage, and additionally, third parties may have significant claims against us for damages due to personal injury, death, property damage, pollution and loss of business.\nWe maintain insurance coverage against substantially all of the casualty and liability risks listed above, subject to deductibles and certain exclusions. We have renewed our primary insurance program for the insurance year 2014-2015. We can provide no assurance, however, that our insurance coverage will be available beyond the renewal periods, or that it will be adequate to cover future claims that may arise.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, including the notes, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could:\n\u25cf\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u25cf\nlimit our ability to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, research and development costs and other general corporate financing needs;\n\u25cf\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, dividend payments, stock repurchases, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes;\n\u25cf\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u25cf\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u25cf\nlimit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds or dispose of assets.\nWe may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. If our capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, discontinue dividend payments and/or stock repurchase plans, or sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. Our facilities agreements and the indenture governing our 6.375% senior notes due 2022 restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from the disposition. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations.\nChanges in market conditions may impact any stock repurchases.\nTo the extent we engage in stock repurchases, such activity is subject to market conditions, such as the trading prices for our stock, as well as the terms of any stock repurchase plans intended to comply with Rule 10b5-1 or Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. Management, in its discretion, may engage in or discontinue stock repurchases at any time.\nA substantial portion of our revenue is derived from our international operations and those operations are subject to foreign government regulation and operating risks.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenue from foreign sources. We therefore face risks inherent in conducting business internationally, such as:\n\u25cf\nforeign currency exchange fluctuations;\n\u25cf\nlegal and governmental regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations;\n\u25cf\nlanguage and cultural differences;\n\u25cf\npotential vessel seizure or nationalization of assets;\n\u25cf\nimport-export quotas or other trade barriers;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods;\n\u25cf\npolitical and economic instability;\n\u25cf\nchanges to shipping tax regimes;\n\u25cf\nrisk arising from counterparty conduct:\n\u25cf\nimposition of currency exchange controls; and\n\u25cf\npotentially adverse tax consequences.\nWe cannot predict whether any such conditions or events might develop in the future or whether they might have a material effect on our operations. Also, our subsidiary structure and our operations are in part based on certain assumptions about various foreign and domestic tax laws, currency exchange requirements and capital repatriation laws. While we believe our assumptions are correct, there can be no assurance that taxing or other authorities will reach the same conclusions. If our assumptions are incorrect or if the relevant countries change or modify such laws or the current interpretation of such laws, we may suffer adverse tax and financial consequences, including the reduction of cash flow available to meet required debt service and other obligations.\nDue to the continuous evolution of laws and regulations in the various markets in which we operate, we may be restricted or even lose the right to operate in certain international markets where we currently have a presence.\nMany of the countries in which we operate have laws, regulations and enforcement systems that are largely undeveloped, and the requirements of these systems are not always readily discernible even to experienced operators. Further, these laws, regulations and enforcement systems can be subject to frequent change or reinterpretation, sometimes with retroactive effect, and taxes, fees, fines or penalties may be sought from us based on that reinterpretation or retroactive effect. While we endeavor to comply with applicable laws and regulations, our compliance efforts might not always be wholly successful, and failure to comply may result in administrative and civil penalties, criminal sanctions, imposition of remedial obligations or the suspension or termination of our operations in the jurisdiction. In addition, laws and regulations could be changed or be interpreted in new, unexpected ways that substantially increase our costs which we may not be able to pass through to our customers. Any changes in laws, regulations or standards that would impose additional requirements or restrictions could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur tax expense and effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings could be higher should there be changes in tax legislation in countries where we operate, should we lose our tonnage tax qualifications or tax exemptions, should we increase our operations in high tax jurisdictions where we operate, should there be changes in the mix of income and losses we recognize in tax jurisdictions and/or should we elect to repatriate cash from our foreign operations in amounts higher than recent years.\nOur worldwide operations are conducted through our various domestic and foreign subsidiaries and as a result we are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Any material changes in tax law and related regulations, tax treaties or their interpretations where we have significant operations could result in a higher effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings and a materially higher tax expense.\nFor example, our North Sea operations based in the U.K. and Norway have special tax incentives for qualified shipping operations, commonly referred to as tonnage tax, which provides for a tax based on the net tonnage capacity of qualified vessels, resulting in significantly lower taxes than those that would apply if we were not a qualified shipping company in those jurisdictions. There is no guarantee that current tonnage tax regimes will not be changed or modified which could, along with any of the above mentioned factors, materially adversely affect our international operations and, consequently, our business, operating results and financial condition. Our U.K. and Norway tonnage tax companies are subject to specific disqualification triggers, which, if we fail to manage them, could jeopardize our qualified tonnage tax status in those countries. Certain of the disqualification events or actions are coupled with one or more opportunities to cure or otherwise maintain the tonnage tax qualification but not all are curable. Our qualified Singapore based vessels are exempt from Singapore taxation through December 2017 with extensions available in certain circumstances beyond 2017, but there is no guarantee that extensions will be granted. The qualified Singapore vessels are also subject to specific qualification requirements which if not met could jeopardize our qualified status in Singapore.\nIn addition, our worldwide operations may change in the future such that the mix of our income and losses recognized in the various jurisdictions could change. Any such changes could reduce our ability to utilize tax benefits, such as foreign tax credits, and could result in an increase in our effective tax rate and tax expense.\nOur reported tax expense reflects our intention to permanently reinvest earnings from our foreign operations and therefore those earnings are not subject to U.S. taxation. In the future, we may elect to decrease the portion of annual foreign earnings we intend to permanently reinvest, and, if so, this would increase our overall effective tax rate upwards towards the U.S. federal statutory rate, which is currently 35%. Although we have neither the need nor the inclination to change our current intention, if we should change our intention with regard to our prior years accumulated unremitted foreign earnings, we would recognize a charge to current earnings to reflect the effect of U.S. taxation on those prior years\u2019 unremitted foreign earnings and that charge could be significant and material.\nOur income tax expense, or benefit, and effective tax rate are impacted by inclusion of related U.S. earnings, or losses, taxed at the combined U.S. federal and state tax rates which are subject to tax law changes. In addition, our tax returns are subject to examination and review by the tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate.\nOur international operations and new vessel construction programs are vulnerable to currency exchange rate fluctuations and exchange rate risks.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and exchange rate risks as a result of our foreign operations and when we construct vessels abroad. To minimize the financial impact of these risks, we attempt to match the currency of our debt and operating costs with the currency of the revenue streams. We occasionally enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge specific exposures, which include exposures related to firm contractual commitments in the form of future vessel payments, but we do not speculate in foreign currencies. Because we conduct a large portion of our operations in foreign currencies, any increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar in relation to the value of applicable foreign currencies could potentially adversely affect our operating revenue or construction costs when translated into U.S Dollars.\nDoing business through joint venture operations.\nWe operate in several foreign areas through joint ventures with local companies, in some cases as a result of local laws requiring local company ownership. While the joint venture partner may provide local knowledge and experience, entering into joint ventures often requires us to surrender a measure of control over the assets and operations devoted to the joint venture, and occasions may arise when we do not agree with the business goals and objectives of our partner, or other factors may arise that make the continuation of the relationship unwise or untenable. Any such disagreements or discontinuation of the relationship could disrupt our operations, put assets dedicated to the joint venture at risk, or affect the continuity of our business. If we are unable to resolve issues with a joint venture partner, we may decide to terminate the joint venture and either locate a different partner and continue to work in the area or seek opportunities for our assets in another market. The unwinding of an existing joint venture could prove to be difficult or time-consuming, and the loss of revenue related to the termination or unwinding of a joint venture and costs related to the sourcing of a new partner or the mobilization of assets to another market could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nVessel construction, enhancement, repair and drydock projects are subject to risks, including delays, cost overruns, and ship yard insolvencies which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nOur vessel construction, enhancement, repair and drydock projects are subject to risks, including delay and cost overruns, inherent in any large construction project, including:\n\u25cf\nshortages of equipment;\n\u25cf\nunforeseen engineering problems;\n\u25cf\nwork stoppages;\n\u25cf\nlack of shipyard availability;\n\u25cf\nweather interference;\n\u25cf\nunanticipated cost increases;\n\u25cf\nshortages of materials or skilled labor; and\n\u25cf\ninsolvency of the ship repairer or ship builder.\nSignificant cost overruns or delays in connection with our vessel construction, enhancement, repair and drydock projects could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Significant delays could also result, under certain circumstances, in penalties under, or the termination of, long-term contracts under which our vessels operate. The demand for vessels we construct may diminish from anticipated levels, or we may experience difficulty in acquiring new vessels or obtaining equipment to fix our older vessels due to high demand, both circumstances which may have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability. Recent global economic issues may increase the risk of insolvency of ship builders and ship repairers, which could adversely affect the cost of new construction and the vessel repairs and could result, under certain circumstances, in penalties under, or termination of, long-term contracts relating to vessels under construction.\nMaintaining our current fleet size and configuration and acquiring vessels required for additional future growth require significant capital.\nExpenditures required for the repair, certification and maintenance of a vessel typically increase with vessel age. These expenditures may increase to a level at which they are not economically justifiable and, therefore, to maintain our current fleet size we may seek to construct or acquire additional vessels. Also, customers may prefer modern vessels over older vessels, especially in weaker markets. The cost of adding a new vessel to our fleet ranges from under $10 million to $100 million and potentially higher.\nWhile we expect our cash on hand, cash flow from operations and available borrowings under our credit facilities to be adequate to fund our existing commitments, including our new-build vessel construction program, our ability to pay these amounts is dependent upon the success of our operations. To date, we have been able to obtain adequate financing to fund all of our commitments. See \u201cLong Term Debt\u201d and \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d in our Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\u201cMD&A\u201d) included in Part II, Item 7. We can give no assurance that we will have sufficient capital resources to build or acquire the vessels required to expand or to maintain our current fleet size and vessel configuration.\nWe have high levels of fixed costs that will be incurred regardless of our level of business activity.\nOur business has high fixed costs. Downtime or low productivity due to reduced demand, weather interruptions or other causes can have a significant negative effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nGrowth through acquisitions and investment could result in operating difficulties, dilution and other harmful consequences that may adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nWe regularly evaluate potential acquisitions of single vessels, vessel fleets and businesses, and we expect to continue to enter into discussions regarding a wide array of potential strategic transactions. The process of integrating an acquisition could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. The areas where we face risks include:\n\u25cf\ndiversion of management time and focus away from operating our business to integrating the business;\n\u25cf\nintegration of the acquired company\u2019s accounting, human resources and other administrative systems and the coordination of various business functions;\n\u25cf\nimplementation of, and changes to, controls, procedures and policies at the acquired company;\n\u25cf\ntransition of customers into our operations;\n\u25cf\nin the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries or regions;\n\u25cf\ncultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization, and retention of employees from the businesses we acquire;\n\u25cf\nliability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities; and\n\u25cf\nlitigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties.\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions or investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments, incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business in general.\nFuture acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt or contingent liabilities, an increase in amortization expenses or write-offs of goodwill, any of which could harm our financial condition.\nWe can give no assurances that we will be able to identify desirable acquisition candidates or that we will be successful in entering into definitive agreements or closing such acquisitions on satisfactory terms. An inability to acquire additional vessels or businesses may limit our growth potential.\nOur industry is highly competitive, which could depress vessel prices and utilization and adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe operate in a competitive industry. The principal competitive factors in the marine support and transportation services industry include:\n\u25cf\nprice, service and reputation of vessel operations and crews;\n\u25cf\nnational flag preference;\n\u25cf\noperating conditions;\n\u25cf\nsuitability of vessel types;\n\u25cf\nvessel availability;\n\u25cf\ntechnical capabilities of equipment and personnel;\n\u25cf\nsafety and efficiency;\n\u25cf\ncomplexity of maintaining logistical support; and\n\u25cf\ncost of moving equipment from one market to another.\nIn addition, an expansion in the supply of vessels in the regions in which we compete, whether through new vessel construction, the refurbishment of older vessels, or the conversion of vessels, could lower charter rates, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we have. Competitive bidding and downward pressures on profits and pricing margins could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe operations of our fleet may be subject to seasonal factors.\nOperations in the North Sea are generally at their highest levels during the months from April through August and at their lowest levels from December through February primarily due to lower construction activity and harsh weather conditions affecting the movement of drilling rigs. Vessels operating offshore Southeast Asia are generally at their lowest utilization rates during the monsoon season, which moves across the Asian continent between September and early March. The monsoon season for a specific Southeast Asian location is generally about two months. Activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, like the North Sea, is often slower during the winter months when construction projects and other specialized jobs are most difficult, and during the hurricane season from June through November, although following a hurricane, activity may increase as there may be a greater demand for vessel services as repair and remediation activities take place. Operations in any market may be affected by seasonality often related to unusually long or short construction seasons due to, among other things, abnormal weather conditions, as well as market demand associated with increased drilling and development activities.\nWe are subject to war, sabotage, piracy, cyber-attacks and terrorism risk.\nWar, sabotage, pirate, cyber and terrorist attacks or any similar risk may affect our operations in unpredictable ways, including changes in the insurance markets, disruptions of fuel supplies and markets, particularly oil, and the possibility that infrastructure facilities, including pipelines, production facilities, refineries, electric generation, transmission and distribution facilities, offshore rigs and vessels, and communications infrastructures, could be direct targets of, or indirect casualties of, a cyber-attack or an act of piracy or terror. War or risk of war may also have an adverse effect on the economy. Insurance coverage can be difficult to obtain in areas of pirate and terrorist attacks resulting in increased costs that could continue to increase. We continually evaluate the need to maintain this insurance coverage as it applies to our fleet. Instability in the financial markets as a result of war, sabotage, piracy, cyber-attacks or terrorism could also affect our ability to raise capital and could also adversely affect the oil, natural gas and power industries and restrict their future growth.\nA failure in our operational systems or cyber security attacks on any of our facilities, or those of third parties, may adversely affect our financial results.\nOur business is dependent upon our operational systems to process a large amount of data and complex transactions. If any of our financial, operational, or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings, our financial results could be adversely affected. Our financial results could also be adversely affected if an employee causes our operational systems to fail, either as a result of inadvertent error or by deliberately tampering with or manipulating our operational systems. In addition, dependence upon automated systems may further increase the risk operational system flaws, employee tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect.\nDue to increased technology advances, we have become more reliant on technology to help increase efficiency in our business. We use computer programs to help run our financial and operations sectors, and this may subject our business to increased risks. Any cyber security attacks that affect our facilities, our customers and any financial data could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, cyber-attacks on our customer and employee data may result in a financial loss and may negatively impact our reputation. Third-party systems on which we rely could also suffer operational system failure. Any of these occurrences could disrupt our business, result in potential liability or reputational damage or otherwise have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nOur U.S. flagged vessels may be requisitioned or purchased by the United States in case of national emergency or a threat to security.\nWe are subject to the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, which provides that, upon proclamation by the President of a national emergency or a threat to the security of the national defense, the Secretary of Transportation may requisition or purchase any vessel or other watercraft owned by United States citizens (which includes United States corporations), including vessels under construction in the United States. If our vessels were purchased or requisitioned by the federal government, we would be entitled to be paid the fair market value of the vessel in the case of a purchase or, in the case of a requisition, the fair market value of charter hire, but we would not be entitled to be compensated for any consequential damages we suffer. The purchase or the requisition for an extended period of time of one or more of our vessels could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Maritime Restrictions established to comply with the Jones Act may have an adverse effect on us and our stockholders.\nOur Class A common stock is subject to certain transfer and ownership restrictions designed to protect our eligibility to engage in Coastwise Trade, including restrictions that limit the maximum permitted percentage of outstanding shares of Class A common stock that may be owned or controlled in the aggregate by non-U.S. citizens to a maximum of 22 percent (collectively, the \u201cMaritime Restrictions\u201d). These Maritime Restrictions:\n\u25cf\nmay cause the market price of our Class A common stock to be lower than the market price of our competitors who may not impose similar restrictions;\n\u25cf\nmay result in transfers to non-U.S. citizens being void and ineffective and, thus, may impede or limit the ability of our stockholders to transfer or purchase shares of our Class A common stock;\n\u25cf\nprovide for the automatic transfer of shares in excess of the maximum permitted percentage (\u201cExcess Shares\u201d) to a trust for sale and may result in non-U.S. citizens suffering losses from the sale of Excess Shares;\n\u25cf\npermit us to redeem Excess Shares, which may result in stockholders who are non-U.S. citizens being required to sell their Excess Shares of Class A common stock at an undesirable time or price or on unfavorable terms;\n\u25cf\nmay adversely affect our financial condition if we must redeem Excess Shares or if we do not have the funds or ability to redeem the Excess Shares; and\n\u25cf\nmay impede or discourage efforts by a third party to acquire the Company, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders.\nOur business could be adversely affected if we do not comply with the Jones Act.\nWe are subject to the Jones Act, which requires that vessels carrying passengers or cargo between U.S. ports in Coastwise Trade be owned and managed by U.S. citizens, and be built in and registered under the laws of the United States. Violations of the Jones Act would result in our becoming ineligible to engage in Coastwise Trade, the imposition of substantial penalties against us, including seizure or forfeiture of our vessels, and/or the inability to register our vessels in the United States, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Currently, we believe we meet the requirements to engage in Coastwise Trade, and the Maritime Restrictions imposed as part of the Reorganization were designed to assist us in complying with these requirements, but there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance with the Jones Act in the future.\nCircumvention or repeal of the Jones Act may have an adverse impact on us.\nThe Jones Act\u2019s provisions restricting Coastwise Trade to vessels controlled by U.S. citizens may from time to time be circumvented by foreign interests that seek to engage in trade reserved for vessels controlled by U.S. citizens and otherwise qualifying for Coastwise Trade. Legal challenges against such actions are difficult, costly to pursue and are of uncertain outcome. There have also been attempts to repeal or amend the Jones Act, and these attempts are expected to continue. In addition, the Secretary of Homeland Security may suspend the citizenship requirements of the Jones Act in the interest of national defense. To the extent foreign competition is permitted from vessels built in lower-cost shipyards and crewed by non-U.S. citizens with favorable tax regimes and with lower wages and benefits, such competition could have a material adverse effect on domestic companies in the offshore service vessel industry subject to the Jones Act such as us.\nWe depend on key personnel, and our U.S. citizen requirements may limit our ability to recruit and retain qualified directors and executive officers.\nWe depend to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and other key management personnel. There is no assurance that these individuals will continue in such capacity for any particular period of time. The loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers or key management personnel could adversely affect our operations.\nAs long as shares of our Class A common stock remain outstanding, our chairman of the board and chief executive officer, by whatever title, must be U.S. citizens. In addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws specify that not more than a minority of directors comprising the minimum number of members of the Board of Directors necessary to constitute a quorum of the Board of Directors (or such other portion as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to comply with applicable law) may be non-U.S. citizens so long as shares of our Class A common stock remain outstanding. Our bylaws provide for similar citizenship requirements with regard to committees of the Board of Directors. As a result, we may be unable to allow a non-U.S. citizen, who would otherwise be qualified, to serve as a director or as our chairman of the board or chief executive officer.\nWe may be unable to attract and retain qualified, skilled employees necessary to operate our business.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel. Our inability to hire, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees could impair our ability to manage, maintain and grow our business.\nIn crewing our vessels, we require skilled employees who can perform physically demanding work, often in harsh or challenging environments for extended periods of time. As a result of the volatility of the oil and gas industry and the demanding nature of the work, potential vessel employees may choose to pursue employment in fields that offer a more desirable work environment at wage rates that are competitive with ours. Further, we face strong competition within the broader oilfield industry for potential employees, including competition from drilling rig operators, for our fleet personnel. As vessels under our new vessel construction program are placed in service, we may not be able to hire a sufficient number of employees. It is possible that we will have to raise wage rates to attract workers and to retain our current employees. If we are not able to increase our charges to our customers to compensate for wage increases, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. If we are unable to recruit qualified personnel we may not be able to operate our vessels at full utilization, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nClimate change, climate change regulations and greenhouse gas effects may adversely impact our operations and markets.\nThere is a concern that emissions of greenhouse gases (\u201cGHG\u201d), such as carbon dioxide and methane, alter the composition of the global atmosphere in ways that affect the global climate. Climate change, including the impact of global warming, may create physical and financial risk for organizations whose operations are affected by the climate. Some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFinancial risks relating to climate change are likely to arise from increasing regulation of GHG emissions, as compliance with any new rules could be difficult and costly. For example, from time to time legislation has been proposed in the U.S. Congress to reduce GHG emissions. In addition, in the absence of federal GHG legislation, the EPA has taken several recent steps to regulate GHG emissions. Depending on the outcome of these or other regulatory initiatives, increased energy, environmental and other costs and capital expenditures could be necessary to comply with the relevant limitations. Our vessels also operate in foreign jurisdictions that are addressing climate changes by legislation or regulation. Unless and until legislation or regulations are enacted and their terms are finalized, we cannot reasonably or reliably estimate its impact on our financial condition, operating performance or ability to compete. In addition, any GHG related legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil and gas produced by our customers. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of GHGs could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPrior events in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico have adversely impacted and are likely to continue to adversely impact our operations and financial condition.\nIn the aftermath of the Macondo Incident, a rig explosion and fire and subsequent oil spill, in the Gulf of Mexico in April 2010, regulatory agencies with jurisdiction over oil and gas exploration adopted numerous new regulations and operating procedures. If the new regulations, operating procedures and possibility of increased legal liability are viewed by our current or future customers as a significant increased financial burden on the drilling projects in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, drillships and other floating rigs could depart the U.S. Gulf of Mexico for other potentially more profitable regions, which would likely affect the demand for our equipment and services. In addition, government agencies could issue new safety and environmental guidelines or regulations for drilling in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico that could disrupt or delay drilling operations, increase the cost of drilling operations or reduce the area of operations available for drilling. All of these uncertainties, including such announced and potential changes in laws and regulations, the cost or availability of insurance and the decisions by customers, governmental agencies or other industry participants could result in a reduced demand for our equipment and services or increase our cost of operations, which could have an adverse effect on our business. We cannot reasonably or reliably estimate to what extent any of the foregoing changes will occur, when they will occur, or how severely they will impact us.\nThe early termination of contracts on our vessels could have an adverse effect on our operations and our backlog may not be converted to actual operating results for any future period.\nSome of the long-term contracts for our vessels and all contracts with governmental entities and national oil companies contain early termination options in favor of the customer; however, some have early termination remedies or other provisions designed to discourage the customers from exercising such options. We cannot assure that our customers would not choose to exercise their termination rights in spite of such remedies or the threat of litigation with us. Until replacement of such business with other customers, any termination could temporarily disrupt our business or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We might not be able to replace such business on economically equivalent terms. In those circumstances, the amount of backlog could be reduced and the conversion of backlog into revenue could be impaired.\nWe may be unable to collect amounts owed to us by our customers.\nWe typically grant our customers credit on a short-term basis. Related credit risks are inherent as we do not typically collateralize receivables due from customers. We provide estimates for uncollectible accounts based primarily on our judgment using historical losses, current economic conditions and individual evaluations of each customer as evidence supporting the receivables valuations stated on our financial statements. However, our receivables valuation estimates may not be accurate and receivables due from customers reflected in our financial statements may not be collectible.\nAdverse results of legal proceedings could materially adversely affect us.\nWe are subject to and may in the future be subject to a variety of legal proceedings and claims that arise out of the ordinary conduct of our business. Results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Irrespective of its merits, litigation may be both lengthy and disruptive to our operations and may cause significant expenditure and diversion of management attention. We may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that could materially adversely affect a portion of our business operations or materially and adversely affect our financial position and our results of operations should we fail to prevail in certain matters.\nA decrease in our customer base could adversely affect demand for our services and reduce our revenues.\nWe derive a significant amount of our revenue from a small number of offshore energy companies. Our loss of one of these significant clients, if not offset by sales to new or other existing clients, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, in recent years, oil and natural gas companies, energy companies and drilling contractors have undergone substantial consolidation and additional consolidation is possible. Consolidation results in fewer companies to charter or contract for our services. Also, merger activity among both major and independent oil and natural gas companies affects exploration, development and production activity as the consolidated companies integrate operations to increase efficiency and reduce costs. Less promising exploration and development projects of a combined company may be dropped or delayed. Such activity may result in an exploration and development budget for a combined company that is lower than the total budget of both companies before consolidation, which could adversely affect demand for our vessels and thereby reduce our revenues.", "PERMNO": 84808, "SIC": 4412, "TIC": "GLF"}
