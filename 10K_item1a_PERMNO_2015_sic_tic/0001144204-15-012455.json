{"cik": "946647", "company": "FIRST DEFIANCE FINANCIAL CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe risks listed below present risks that could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, or business. The risks and uncertainties described below are the not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair the Company\u2019s business operations.\nEconomic and financial market conditions may adversely affect First Defiance\u2019s operations and financial condition.\nIn recent years, economic growth and business activity across a wide range of industries and regions in the U.S. has been slow and uneven. Furthermore, there are continuing concerns related to the level of United States government debt and fiscal actions that may be taken to address that debt. There can be no assurance that economic conditions will continue to improve, and these conditions could worsen. In addition, ongoing federal budget negotiations, the implementation of the employer mandate under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the level of United States debt may have a destabilizing effect on financial markets.\nFirst Defiance\u2019s financial performance generally, and in particular the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans, as well as demand for loans and other products and services First Defiance offers, is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where the Company operates, mainly in the State of Ohio and in the Great Lake Region. A favorable business environment is generally characterized by, among other factors, economic growth, efficient capital markets, low inflation, low unemployment, high business and investor confidence, and strong business earnings. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital; increases in inflation or interest rates; high unemployment, natural disasters; or a combination of these or other factors.\nOverall, during recent years, the business environment has been adverse for many households and businesses in the United States and globally. While economic conditions in the State of Ohio, the United States and worldwide have shown signs of improvement, there can be no assurance that this improvement will continue. Economic pressure on consumers and uncertainty regarding continuing economic improvement may result in changes in consumer and business spending, borrowing and savings habits. Such conditions could have a material adverse effect on the credit quality of the Company\u2019s loans and First Defiance\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nFirst Defiance\u2019s loan portfolio includes a concentration of commercial real estate loans and commercial loans, which involve risks specific to real estate value and the successful operations of these businesses.\nAt December 31, 2014, First Federal\u2019s portfolio of commercial real estate loans totaled $840.5 million, or approximately 49.8% of total loans. First Federal\u2019s commercial real estate loans typically have higher principal amounts than residential real estate loans, and many of our commercial real estate borrowers have more than one loan outstanding. As a result, an adverse development on one loan can expose First Defiance to greater risk of loss on other loans. Additionally, repayment of the loans is generally dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the properties securing the loans to cover operating expenses and debt service. Economic conditions and events outside of the control of the borrower or lender could negatively impact the future cash flow and market values of the affected properties.\n- 25 -\nAt December 31, 2014, First Federal\u2019s portfolio of commercial loans totaled $399.7 million, or approximately 23.7% of total loans. Commercial loans generally expose First Defiance to a greater risk of nonpayment and loss than commercial real estate or residential real estate loans since repayment of such loans often depends on the successful operations and income stream of the borrowers. First Federal\u2019s commercial loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower such as accounts receivable, inventory, machinery or real estate. In the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers. The collateral securing other loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business. Credit support provided by the borrower for most of these loans and the probability of repayment is based on the liquidation of the pledged collateral and enforcement of a personal guarantee, if any exists.\nFirst Defiance targets its business lending towards small and medium-sized businesses, many of which have fewer financial resources than larger companies and may be more susceptible to economic downturns. If general economic conditions negatively impact these businesses, First Defiance\u2019s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nIncreases to the allowance for loan losses may cause First Defiance\u2019s earnings to decrease.\nFirst Federal makes a number of assumptions and judgments about the collectability of its loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, First Federal relies on loan quality reviews, past loss experience, and an evaluation of economic conditions, among other factors. If its assumptions prove to be incorrect, First Federal\u2019s allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual losses, resulting in additions to the allowance. In addition, bank regulators periodically review First Federal\u2019s allowance and may require First Federal to increase its allowance. Material additions to the allowance and any loan losses that exceed First Federal\u2019s reserves would materially adversely affect First Defiance\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in interest rates can adversely affect First Defiance\u2019s profitability\nFirst Defiance\u2019s earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon its net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond First Defiance\u2019s control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Federal Open Market Committee. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest First Defiance receives on loans and securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect (i) First Defiance\u2019s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, (ii) the fair value of First Defiance\u2019s financial assets and liabilities, and (iii) the average duration of certain assets and liabilities. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, First Defiance\u2019s net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. Any substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on First Defiance\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nFirst Federal originates a significant amount of residential mortgage loans that it sells in the secondary market. The origination of residential mortgage loans is highly dependent on the local real estate market and the current interest rates. Increasing interest rates tend to reduce the origination of loans for sale and consequently fee income, which First Defiance reports as mortgage banking income. Conversely, decreasing interest rates have the effect of causing clients to refinance mortgage loans faster than anticipated. This causes the value of mortgage servicing rights on the loans sold to be lower than originally anticipated. If this happens, First Defiance may be required to write down the value of its mortgage servicing rights faster than anticipated, which will increase expense and lower earnings. Accelerated repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities could result in the reinvestment of funds at lower rates than the loans or securities were paying.\n- 26 -\nLaws and regulations may affect First Defiance\u2019s results of operations.\nThe earnings of financial institutions are affected by the regulations and policies of various regulatory authorities, including the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the FDIC and the CFPB. The Federal Reserve has extensive supervisory authority over the Company, affecting a comprehensive range of matters relating to ownership and control of First Defiance\u2019s shares, First Defiance\u2019s acquisition of other companies and businesses, permissible activities for the Company to engage in, maintenance of adequate capital levels and other aspects of operations. These supervisory and regulatory powers are intended primarily for the protection for First Defiance\u2019s depositors and borrowers and the deposit insurance fund, rather than First Defiance\u2019s shareholders.\nComprehensive revisions to the regulatory capital framework were finalized by the FRB, the OCC, and the FDIC in 2013 and 2014. The revised regulations change what qualifies as regulatory capital, raises minimum requirements and introduces the concept of additional capital buffers. The need to maintain more and higher quality capital as well as greater liquidity going forward could limit our business activities, including lending, and our ability to expand, either organically or through acquisitions. In addition, the new liquidity standards could require us to increase our holdings of highly liquid short-term investments, thereby reducing our ability to invest in longer-term assets even if more desirable from a balance sheet management perspective.\nThe laws and regulations applicable to the banking industry could change at any time. As a result of ongoing challenges facing the U.S. economy in particular, the potential exists for new laws and regulations, and bank regulatory agencies are expected to be active in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations. Increased regulation could increase First Defiance\u2019s cost of compliance and reduce its income to the extent that they limit the manner in which First Defiance may conduct business, including its ability to offer new products, charge fees for specific products and services, obtain financing, attract deposits, make loans and achieve satisfactory interest spreads.\nFirst Defiance\u2019s ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost may adversely affect net income.\nFirst Defiance\u2019s principal sources of liquidity are local deposits and wholesale funding sources such as FHLB advances, Federal Funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, and brokered or other out-of-market certificate of deposit purchases. Also, First Defiance maintains a portfolio of securities that can be used as a secondary source of liquidity. First Defiance\u2019s access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize its activities or on terms that are acceptable could be impaired by factors that affect First Defiance directly or the financial services industry or economy in general, such as further disruptions in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry.\nOther possible sources of liquidity include the sale or securitization of loans, the issuance of additional collateralized borrowings beyond those currently utilized with the FHLB, the issuance of debt securities and the issuance of preferred or common securities in public or private transactions, or borrowings from a commercial bank. First Defiance does not currently have any borrowings from a commercial bank, but it has used them in the past.\nAny decline in available funding could adversely impact our ability to originate loans, invest in securities, meet our expenses, pay dividends to First Defiance\u2019s shareholders, or fulfill obligations such as repaying First Defiance\u2019s borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, business, results of operations and financial condition.\n- 27 -\nCompetition affects First Defiance\u2019s earnings.\nFirst Defiance\u2019s continued profitability depends on its ability to continue to effectively compete to originate loans and attract and retain deposits. Competition for both loans and deposits is intense in the financial services industry. The Company competes in its market area by offering superior service and competitive rates and products. The type of institutions First Defiance competes with include large regional commercial banks, smaller community banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking firms, credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance agencies and mutual funds. As a result of their size and ability to achieve economies of scale, certain of First Defiance\u2019s competitors can offer a broader range of products and services than the Company can offer. To stay competitive in its market area, First Defiance may need to adjust the interest rates on its products to match rates of its competition, which could have a negative impact on net interest margin.\nThe increasing complexity of First Defiance\u2019s operations presents varied risks that could affect its earnings and financial condition.\nFirst Defiance processes a large volume of transactions on a daily basis and is exposed to numerous types of risks related to internal processes, people and systems. These risks include, but are not limited to, the risk of fraud by persons inside or outside the Company, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and systems, breaches of data security and our internal control system and compliance with a complex array of consumer and safety and soundness regulations. First Defiance could also experience additional loss as a result of potential legal actions that could arise as a result of operational deficiencies or as a result of noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations.\nFirst Defiance has established and maintains a system of internal controls that provides management with information on a timely basis and allows for the monitoring of compliance with operational standards. These systems have been designed to manage operational risks at an appropriate, cost effective level. Procedures exist that are designed to ensure that policies relating to conduct, ethics, and business practices are followed. Losses from operational risks may still occur, however, including losses from the effects of operational errors.\nUnauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or customer information, whether through a breach of the Company\u2019s computer systems or otherwise, could severely harm its business.\nPotential misuse of funds or information by First Defiance\u2019s employees or by third parties could result in damage to First Defiance\u2019s customers for which First Defiance could be held liable, subject First Defiance to regulatory sanctions and otherwise adversely affect First Defiance\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nFirst Defiance\u2019s employees handle a significant amount of funds, as well as financial and personal information. Although First Defiance has implemented systems to minimize the risk of fraudulent taking or misuse of funds or information, there can be no assurance that such systems will be adequate or that a taking or misuse of funds or information by employees, by third parties who have authorized access to funds or information, or by third parties who are able to access funds or information without authorization will never occur. First Defiance could be held liable for such an event and could also be subject to regulatory sanctions. First Defiance could also incur the expense of developing additional controls to prevent future such occurrences. Although First Defiance has insurance to cover such potential losses, First Defiance cannot provide assurance that such insurance will be adequate to meet any liability. In addition, any loss of trust or confidence placed in First Defiance by our clients could result in a loss of business, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n- 28 -\nFirst Defiance could suffer a material adverse impact from interruptions in the effective operation of, or security breaches affecting, First Defiance\u2019s computer systems.\nFirst Defiance relies heavily on information systems to conduct our business and to process, record, and monitor transactions. Risks to the system result from a variety of factors, including the potential for bad acts on the part of hackers, criminals, employees and others. As one example, in recent years, some banks have experienced denial of service attacks in which individuals or organizations flood the bank\u2019s website with extraordinarily high volumes of traffic, with the goal and effect of disrupting the ability of the bank to process transactions. First Defiance is also at risk for the impact of natural disasters, terrorism and international hostilities on its systems or for the effects of outages or other failures involving power or communications systems operated by others. These risks also arise from the same types of threats to businesses with which First Defiance deals.\nPotential adverse consequences of attacks on First Defiance\u2019s computer systems or other threats include damage to First Defiance\u2019s reputation, loss of customer business, litigation and increased regulatory scrutiny, which might also result in financial loss and require additional efforts and expense to attempt to prevent such adverse consequences in the future.\nIf First Defiance forecloses on collateral property and owns the underlying real estate, First Defiance may be subject to the increased costs associated with the ownership of real property, resulting in reduced income.\nA significant portion of First Defiance\u2019s loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, First Defiance may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, First Defiance may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage.\nIn addition, when First Defiance forecloses on real property, the amount First Defiance realizes after a default is dependent upon factors outside of First Defiance\u2019s control, including, but not limited to, economic conditions, neighborhood real estate values, interest rates, real estate taxes, operating expenses of the mortgaged properties, zoning laws, governmental rules, regulations and fiscal policies, and acts of God. Certain expenditures associated with the ownership of real estate, principally real estate taxes and maintenance costs, may adversely affect the income from the real estate. Therefore, the cost of operating real property may exceed the rental income earned from such property, and First Defiance may have to sell the property at a loss. The foregoing expenditures could adversely affect First Defiance\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nFirst Defiance\u2019s business strategy includes planned growth. First Defiance\u2019s financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if First Defiance fails to grow or fails to manage its growth effectively.\nFirst Defiance\u2019s ability to grow successfully will depend on a variety of factors, including the continued availability of desirable business opportunities, its ability to integrate acquisitions and manage growth and First Defiance\u2019s ability to raise capital. There can be no assurance that growth opportunities will be available.\nFirst Defiance may acquire other financial institutions or parts of institutions in the future, open new branches, and consider new lines of business and new products or services. Expansions of its business would involve a number of expenses and risks, including:\n\u00b7 the time and costs associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions or expansions into new markets;\n- 29 -\n\u00b7 the potential inaccuracy of estimates and judgments used to evaluate the business and risks with respect to target institutions;\n\u00b7 the time and costs of hiring local management and opening new offices;\n\u00b7 the delay between commencing making acquisitions or engaging in new activities and the generation of profits from the expansion;\n\u00b7 First Defiance\u2019s ability to finance an expansion and the possible dilution to existing shareholders;\n\u00b7 the diversion of management\u2019s attention to the expansion;\n\u00b7 management\u2019s lack of familiarity with new market areas;\n\u00b7 the integration of new products and services and new personnel into First Defiance\u2019s existing business;\n\u00b7 the incurrence and possible impairment of goodwill associated with an acquisition and effects on First Defiance\u2019s results of operations; and\n\u00b7 the risk of loss of key employees and customers.\nFailure to manage First Defiance\u2019s growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on its business, future prospects, financial condition or results of operations and could adversely affect First Defiance\u2019s ability to successfully implement its business strategy.\nFirst Defiance\u2019s ability to pay dividends is subject to regulatory limitations which, to the extent First Defiance requires such dividends in the future, may affect its ability to pay dividends or repurchase its stock.\nAs a savings and loan holding company, First Defiance is a separate legal entity from First Federal and does not have significant operations of its own. Dividends from First Federal provide a significant source of capital for First Defiance. The availability of dividends from First Federal is limited by various statutes and regulations. The federal banking regulators require that insured financial institutions and their holding companies should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings. It is possible, depending upon the financial condition of First Federal and other factors, that the OCC, as First Federal\u2019s primary regulator, could assert that the payment of dividends or other payments by First Federal are an unsafe or unsound practice. In the event First Federal is unable to pay dividends to First Defiance, First Defiance may not be able to pay its obligations as they become due, repurchase its stock, or pay dividends on its common stock. Consequently, the potential inability to receive dividends from First Defiance could adversely affect First Defiance\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\n- 30 -", "PERMNO": 79382, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "PFC"}
