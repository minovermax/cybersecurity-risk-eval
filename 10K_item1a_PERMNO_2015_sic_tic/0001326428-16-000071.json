{"cik": "1326428", "company": "LINN ENERGY, LLC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business has many risks. Factors that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results or liquidity and the trading price of our units are described below. This information should be considered carefully, together with other information in this report and other reports and materials we file with the SEC.\nIf we are unable to repay or refinance our existing and future debt as it becomes due, whether at maturity or as a result of acceleration, we may be unable to continue as a going concern.\nWe have significant indebtedness under our May 2019 senior notes, November 2019 senior notes, April 2020 senior notes, Berry November 2020 senior notes, December 2020 senior secured second lien notes, February 2021 senior notes, September 2021 senior notes and Berry September 2022 senior notes (collectively, \u201cNotes\u201d) and our Credit Facilities. As of February 29, 2016, we had an aggregate amount of approximately $9.3 billion outstanding under our Notes and our Credit Facilities (with additional borrowing capacity of less than $1 million). As a result of our indebtedness, we use a significant portion of our cash flow to pay interest and principal (when due) on our Notes and Credit Facilities, which reduces the cash available to finance our operations and other business activities and limits our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate.\nBased on our current estimates and expectations for commodity prices in 2016, we do not expect to remain in compliance with all of the restrictive covenants contained in our Credit Facilities throughout 2016 unless those requirements are waived or amended. Additionally, the borrowing bases under our Credit Facilities are subject to redeterminations in April 2016. Because the Credit Facilities are effectively fully drawn, any reduction in the borrowing bases would require us to make mandatory prepayments to the extent existing indebtedness exceeds the new borrowing bases. We also have substantial interest payments due during the next twelve months on our Notes and our Credit Facilities. If we fail to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness or fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in our Credit Facilities or the indentures governing our Notes, an Event of Default (as defined in the applicable agreements) could result, which would permit acceleration of the indebtedness under certain circumstances and could result in an Event of Default and acceleration of our other debt and permit our secured lenders to foreclose on any of our assets securing such debt. Any accelerated debt would become immediately due and payable.\nWhile we will attempt to take appropriate mitigating actions to refinance any indebtedness prior to its maturity or otherwise extend the maturity dates, and to cure any potential defaults, there is no assurance that any particular actions with respect to refinancing existing indebtedness, extending the maturity of existing indebtedness or curing potential defaults in our existing and future debt agreements will be sufficient. The uncertainty associated with our ability to meet our obligations as they become due raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The report of the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm that accompanies its audited consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains an explanatory paragraph regarding the substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe are currently in default under the LINN Credit Facility and the Second Lien Indenture.\nUnder the LINN Credit Facility, we are required to deliver audited consolidated financial statements without a going concern or like qualification or explanation. Because the audit report prepared by our auditors with respect to the consolidated financial statements includes such going concern explanation, we are currently in default under the LINN Credit Facility.\nIf we are unable to obtain a waiver or other suitable relief from the lenders under the LINN Credit Facility prior to the expiration of the 30 day grace period, an Event of Default will result and the lenders holding a majority of the commitments under the LINN Credit Facility could accelerate the outstanding indebtedness, which would make it immediately due and payable. If we are unable to obtain a waiver from or otherwise reach an agreement with the lenders under the LINN Credit Facility and the indebtedness under the LINN Credit Facility is accelerated, then an Event of Default under LINN Energy\u2019s senior notes and second lien notes would occur, which, if it continues beyond any applicable cure periods, would, to the extent the applicable lenders so elect, result in the acceleration of those obligations. Furthermore, an Event of Default under\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\nthe LINN Credit Facility will also result in an Event of Default under the Berry Credit Facility, which in the absence of a waiver or other suitable relief and upon the election of the agent or lenders holding a majority of commitments under the Berry Credit Facility would result in the acceleration of indebtedness under the Berry Credit Facility. Such Event of Default would trigger an Event of Default under the Berry senior notes. If such Event of Default continues beyond any applicable cure periods, such Event of Default would result in an acceleration of the Berry senior notes.\nAdditionally, the Second Lien Indenture required us to deliver mortgages by February 18, 2016, subject to a 45 day grace period. We elected to exercise our right to the grace period and not deliver the mortgages, and as a result, we are currently in default under the Second Lien Indenture. If we do not deliver the mortgages within the 45 day grace period or is otherwise unable to obtain a waiver or other suitable relief from the holders under the Second Lien Indenture prior to the expiration of the 45 day grace period, an Event of Default (as defined in the Second Lien Indenture) will result and if the trustee or noteholders holding at least 25% in the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the second lien notes so elect would accelerate the second lien notes causing them to be immediately due and payable.\nAn Event of Default under the Second Lien Indenture triggers a cross-default under the LINN Credit Facility and Berry Credit Facility and, as discussed above, if the applicable lenders so elect would result in acceleration under the LINN Credit Facility and Berry Credit Facility. In addition, as discussed above, an acceleration of the obligations under the Second Lien Indenture or LINN Credit Facility would trigger a cross-default to LINN Energy\u2019s senior notes and if the applicable lenders so elect would result in a cross-acceleration under LINN Energy\u2019s senior notes, and an acceleration of the Berry Credit Facility if the applicable lenders so elect would result in cross-acceleration under the Berry senior notes.\nIf lenders, and subsequently noteholders, accelerate our outstanding indebtedness, it will become immediately due and payable and we will not have sufficient liquidity to repay those amounts. We are currently in discussions with various stakeholders and are pursuing or considering a number of actions, but there can be no assurance that sufficient liquidity can be obtained from one or more of these actions or that these actions can be consummated within the period needed to meet certain obligations, and we could be required to immediately file for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\nIn addition, we expect the audit report Berry will receive with respect to its financial statements to contain an explanatory paragraph expressing uncertainty as to its ability to continue as a going concern, which would constitute a default under the Berry Credit Facility. If Berry does not obtain a waiver or other suitable relief from the lenders under the Berry Credit Facility before the expiration of the 30 day grace period, there will be an Event of Default under the Berry Credit Facility. If an Event of Default occurs under the Berry Credit Facility, the lenders holding a majority of the commitments could accelerate the loans outstanding under the Berry Credit Facility, which would in turn trigger cross-acceleration rights under the LINN Credit Facility and the indentures governing the Notes.\nWe may seek the protection of the United States Bankruptcy Court (\u201cBankruptcy Court\u201d) which may harm our business and place equity holders at significant risk of losing all of their investment in us.\nWe have engaged financial and legal advisors to assist us in, among other things, analyzing various strategic alternatives to address our liquidity and capital structure, including strategic and refinancing alternatives through a private restructuring. However, a filing under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (\u201cChapter 11\u201d) may be unavoidable. Seeking Bankruptcy Court protection could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. As long as a Chapter 11 proceeding continues, our senior management would be required to spend a significant amount of time and effort dealing with the reorganization instead of focusing exclusively on our business operations. Bankruptcy Court protection also might make it more difficult to retain management and other key personnel necessary to the success and growth of our business. Also during the Chapter 11 proceedings, our ability to enter into new commodity derivatives covering additional estimated future production would be dependent upon either entering into unsecured hedges or obtaining Bankruptcy Court approval to enter into secured hedges. Furthermore, counterparties under our existing hedge transactions may elect to terminate those transactions in connection with a bankruptcy filing without our consent.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness that is senior to our units in our capital structure. As a result, we believe that seeking Bankruptcy Court protection under a Chapter 11 proceeding could cause our units to be canceled, result in a limited recovery for unitholders, if any, and place current equity holders at significant risk of losing all of their investment in us.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\nAny reduction of the borrowing bases under our Credit Facilities will require us to repay that portion of indebtedness that exceeds the new borrowing bases under our Credit Facilities earlier than anticipated, which will adversely impact our liquidity.\nAs of February 29, 2016, total borrowings (including outstanding letters of credit) under the LINN Credit Facility were $3.6 billion with no remaining availability. Total borrowings under the Berry Credit Facility were approximately $899 million with less than $1 million available. Each of our Credit Facilities is subject to scheduled redeterminations of its borrowing base, semi-annually in April and October, based primarily on reserve reports using lender commodity price expectations at such time. Additionally, the lenders under the LINN Credit Facility have the ability to request an interim redetermination of the borrowing base once per calendar year and the lenders under the Berry Credit Facility have the ability to request an interim redetermination of the borrowing base once between scheduled redeterminations. Continued low commodity prices, reductions in our capital budget and the resulting reserve write-downs, along with the maturity schedule of our hedges, are expected to adversely impact future redeterminations.\nBecause the Credit Facilities are effectively fully drawn, any reduction in the Credit Facilities\u2019 borrowing bases will require us or Berry to make mandatory prepayments under the Credit Facilities to the extent existing indebtedness under the Credit Facilities exceeds the new borrowing bases. Although we are not required to, we may choose to contribute or otherwise provide cash to Berry or post restricted cash on Berry\u2019s behalf, which would reduce our liquidity position. We may have insufficient cash on hand to be able to make mandatory prepayments under the Credit Facilities. Any failure to repay indebtedness in excess of our borrowing bases in accordance with the terms of the Credit Facilities would constitute an Event of Default under the Credit Facilities. Such Event of Default would permit our lenders to accelerate the debt, which, if actually accelerated, would become immediately due and payable and could result in a cross-default and cross-acceleration under our other outstanding indebtedness, and could permit our secured lenders to foreclose on any of our assets securing such indebtedness.\nOur ability to comply with financial covenants and ratios in our Credit Facilities and the indentures governing the Notes is affected by events beyond our control, including, among other things, continued low commodity prices. Absent a waiver or amendment, failure to meet these covenants and ratios could result in a default and potentially an acceleration of our existing indebtedness.\nThe Credit Facilities require us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests. Based on current estimates and expectations for commodity prices in 2016, we do not expect to remain in compliance with all of the financial covenants and ratios throughout 2016 unless those requirements are waived or amended. Our inability to comply with the required financial ratios will, if not amended or waived, result in a default under the Credit Facilities.\nIn addition, the LINN Credit Facility requires delivery of audited consolidated financial statements without a going concern or like qualification or explanation to the lenders no later than 90 days after the end of our fiscal year. Due to delivery of the audit report with such going concern explanation, we are in default under the LINN Credit Facility. While the audit opinion is as of December 31, 2015, the default under the LINN Credit Facility does not occur until we have failed to deliver an audit opinion without a going concern or like qualification or explanation, which is the filing date.\nA default under the Credit Facilities, if not cured or waived, could result in an Event of Default which permits the acceleration of all indebtedness outstanding thereunder. The accelerated debt would become immediately due and payable, which would in turn trigger cross-acceleration under our other debt. In addition, if an Event of Default under the Credit Facilities occurs, the lenders could foreclose on the collateral and compel us to apply all of our available cash to repay our borrowings or they could prevent us from making payments on our Notes. If the amounts outstanding under the Credit Facilities, our Notes or any of our other indebtedness were to be accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full the money owed to the lenders or to our other debt holders and we may be unable to borrow sufficient funds to refinance our debt. Even if new financing were available, any such financing may not be on terms that are acceptable to us and may impose financial restrictions and other covenants on us that may be more restrictive than the Credit Facilities or the indentures governing our Notes.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\nRestrictive covenants in the Credit Facilities and in the indentures governing the Notes could limit our growth and our ability to finance our operations, fund our capital needs, respond to changing conditions and engage in other business activities that may be in our best interests.\nRestrictive covenants in the Credit Facilities and in the indentures governing the Notes impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions limit our ability and that of our restricted subsidiaries to, among other things:\n\u2022\nmake distributions to our unitholders or make other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nrefinance certain indebtedness;\n\u2022\ncreate or incur liens;\n\u2022\nengage in certain mergers or consolidations or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments or acquisitions;\n\u2022\nmake certain sales, dispositions or transfers of assets;\n\u2022\nengage in specified transactions with subsidiaries and affiliates;\n\u2022\nrepurchase, redeem or retire our units or Notes; and\n\u2022\npursue other corporate activities.\nWe may be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us by the restrictive covenants in the Credit Facilities and in the indentures governing the Notes. The restrictions contained in the Credit Facilities and those indentures could:\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to plan for, or react to, market conditions, to meet capital needs or otherwise to restrict our activities or business plan; and\n\u2022\nadversely affect our ability to finance our operations, enter into acquisitions or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest.\nWe have a significant level of debt, which could have significant consequences for our business and future prospects.\nAs of February 29, 2016, we had an aggregate amount of approximately $9.3 billion outstanding under our Notes and our Credit Facilities (with additional borrowing capacity of less than $1 million). Our debt and the limitations imposed on us by our existing or future debt agreements could have significant consequences for our business and future prospects, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe will be required to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow to payments of interest and principal on our Credit Facilities and Notes when due;\n\u2022\nwe may be limited in our flexibility to plan for or react to changes in our business and industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to finance our operations and other business activities; and\n\u2022\nwe may have a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors that have less debt.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including our Credit Facilities and Notes, and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash flow in the future. We expect our earnings and cash flow to vary significantly from year to year due to the cyclical nature of our industry. As a result, the amount of debt that we can manage in some periods may not be appropriate for us in other periods. A range of economic, competitive, business and industry factors will affect our future financial performance, and, as a result, our ability to generate cash flow from operations and to pay our debt. Many of these factors, such as oil, natural gas and NGL prices, economic and financial conditions in our industry and the global economy, the impact of legislative or regulatory actions on how we conduct our business or competitive initiatives of our competitors, are beyond our control. Consequently, our future cash flow may be insufficient to meet our debt obligations and commitments. Any cash flow insufficiency could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. To the extent we are unable to make scheduled interest payments or repay our indebtedness as it becomes due or at maturity with cash on hand, we will need to refinance our debt, sell assets or seek additional debt or equity financing. Additional indebtedness and debt or equity financing may not be available to us in the future for the refinancing or repayment of existing indebtedness, and we may not be able to complete asset sales in a timely manner sufficient to make such repayments.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\nDespite our and our subsidiaries\u2019 current level of indebtedness, we may still be able to incur more debt. This could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future. Although the credit agreements governing our Credit Facilities and the indentures that govern our Notes contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Moreover, these restrictions will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness, as defined in the applicable agreements governing our existing indebtedness.\nIf new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face could intensify. Our level of indebtedness could, for instance, prevent us from engaging in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us or from making desirable capital expenditures. This could put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other less leveraged competitors that have more cash flow to devote to their operations. In addition, the incurrence of additional indebtedness could make it more difficult to satisfy our existing financial obligations.\nOur debt rating has been downgraded and liquidity concerns could result in a further downgrade in our debt ratings which could restrict our access to, and negatively impact the terms of, current or future financings or trade credit.\nOur ability to obtain financings and trade credit and the terms of any financings or trade credit are, in part, dependent on the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies. We cannot provide assurance that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. Factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, product mix and commodity pricing levels. Further ratings downgrades could adversely impact our ability to access financings or trade credit, increase our borrowing costs and potentially require us to post letters of credit or other credit support for certain obligations.\nOur substantial indebtedness, liquidity concerns and potential restructuring transactions may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nOur substantial indebtedness, liquidity concerns and potential restructuring transactions may result in uncertainty about our business and cause, among other things:\n\u2022\nour suppliers, vendors, derivatives counterparties and service providers to renegotiate the terms of our agreements, terminate their relationship with us or require financial assurances from us;\n\u2022\nthird parties to lose confidence in our ability to produce oil, natural gas and NGL, resulting in a significant decline in our revenues, profitability and cash flow;\n\u2022\ndifficulty retaining, attracting or replacing key employees; and\n\u2022\nemployees to be distracted from performance of their duties or more easily attracted to other career opportunities.\nThese events, among others, may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nFailure to maintain the continued listing standards of the NASDAQ Global Select Market could result in delisting of our common units, which could negatively impact the market price and liquidity of our common units and our ability to access the capital markets.\nOur common units are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d) and the continued listing of our common units on NASDAQ is subject to our ability to comply with NASDAQ\u2019s continued listing requirements, including, among other things, a minimum closing bid price requirement of $1.00 per common unit. If we fail to satisfy such requirement for a period of 30 consecutive business days, NASDAQ will send us a deficiency notice indicating that we have a compliance period of 180 calendar days from such notice to cure the deficiency by satisfying the minimum bid requirement for a minimum of ten consecutive business days. Failure to regain compliance with the minimum closing bid price requirement could result in delisting of our common units from NASDAQ.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\nTo date in 2016, the bid price of our common units closed below the $1.00 per unit minimum bid price on several occasions. Any delisting from NASDAQ could have a negative impact on the market price and liquidity of our common units. In addition, delisting could harm our ability to access the capital markets and result in the potential loss of confidence by investors, increased employee turnover and fewer business development opportunities.\nDisruptions in the capital and credit markets, continued low commodity prices, our debt level and other factors may restrict our ability to raise capital on favorable terms, or at all.\nDisruptions in the capital and credit markets, in particular with respect to companies in the energy sector, could limit our ability to access these markets or may significantly increase our cost to borrow. Continued low commodity prices, among other factors, have caused some lenders to increase interest rates, enact tighter lending standards which we may not satisfy as a result of our debt level or otherwise, refuse to refinance existing debt at maturity on favorable terms, or at all, and in certain instances have reduced or ceased to provide funding to borrowers. If we are unable to access the capital and credit markets on favorable terms or at all, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Board of Directors has the ability to reserve any or all of our cash on hand at the end of a quarter for purposes other than distribution to unitholders, including reduction of indebtedness.\nAlthough we may have generated sufficient net cash provided by operating activities during any particular quarter, our Board of Directors has the ability under our limited liability company agreement to establish a cash reserve, which could encompass all of the cash otherwise available for distribution, to provide for the proper conduct of our business in both the short and long term. To provide for the proper conduct of our business, the Board of Directors can determine to reserve cash to reduce indebtedness, among other things. For example, in October 2015, our Board of Directors approved a suspension of our distribution. Our decision to reserve all of our cash on hand for such allowed purposes and not distribute it may significantly impact our unitholders, as well as our business and operations. The market value of our units may remain depressed or further decrease unless and until we resume a distribution. In addition, refinancing or restructuring of our debt may require us to accept covenants that further restrict our ability to reinstate the distribution to our unitholders. External perceptions of the health of our business and our liquidity may also be impacted, which could further limit our ability to access capital markets, cause our vendors to tighten our credit terms and cause a strain in our relationship with landowners and other business partners.\nCommodity prices are volatile, and prolonged depressed prices or a further decline in prices would reduce our revenues, net cash provided by operating activities and profitability and would significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur revenues, profitability, cash flow and the carrying value of our properties depend on the prices of and demand for oil, natural gas and NGL. Historically, the oil, natural gas and NGL markets have been very volatile and are expected to continue to be volatile in the future, and prolonged depressed prices or a further decline in prices will significantly affect our financial results and impede our growth. Changes in oil, natural gas and NGL prices have a significant impact on the value of our reserves and on our net cash provided by operating activities. In addition, revenues from certain wells may exceed production costs and nevertheless not generate sufficient return on capital. Prices for these commodities may fluctuate widely in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for them, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control, such as:\n\u2022\nthe domestic and foreign supply of and demand for oil, natural gas and NGL;\n\u2022\nthe price and level of foreign imports;\n\u2022\nthe level of consumer product demand;\n\u2022\nweather conditions;\n\u2022\noverall domestic and global economic conditions;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic conditions in oil and natural gas producing countries;\n\u2022\nthe ability of members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree to and maintain price and production controls;\n\u2022\nthe impact of the U.S. dollar exchange rates on oil, natural gas and NGL prices;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxation;\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\n\u2022\nthe impact of energy conservation efforts;\n\u2022\nthe proximity and capacity of pipelines and other transportation facilities; and\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels.\nDuring 2015, the prices of oil, natural gas and NGL were extremely volatile and declined significantly. Downward pressure on commodity prices has continued in 2016 and may continue for the foreseeable future. The speed and severity of the decline in oil prices from 2014 to 2016 has materially affected our results of operations. If commodity prices continue at current levels for a prolonged period or further decline, our net cash provided by operating activities will decline and our financial position, the quantities of oil and natural gas reserves that we can economically produce, our cash flow available for capital expenditures, our ability to service our debt obligations, our ability to generate free cash flow after capital expenditures and debt service and our ability to access funds under our Credit Facilities and through the capital markets may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe sustained oil, natural gas and NGL price declines have resulted in significant impairments of certain of our properties. Future declines in commodity prices, changes in expected capital development, increases in operating costs or adverse changes in well performance may result in additional write-downs of the carrying amounts of our assets, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in the period incurred.\nWe evaluate the impairment of our oil and natural gas properties on a field-by-field basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded noncash impairment charges (before and after tax) of approximately $5.8 billion. Future declines in oil, natural gas and NGL prices, changes in expected capital development, increases in operating costs or adverse changes in well performance, among other things, may result in us having to make additional material write-downs of the carrying amounts of our assets, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in the period incurred.\nWe may experience difficulties in fully utilizing our alliances with GSO and Quantum, which could cause us to fail to realize many of the anticipated potential benefits of those alliances.\nAs part of our plan to (i) create new sources of capital to allow us to acquire and develop assets without increasing capital intensity, (ii) enhance our long-term ability to live within cash flow and (iii) provide opportunities for dropdowns of stable production over time, we entered into strategic alliances with GSO Capital Partners LP (\u201cGSO\u201d), the credit platform of The Blackstone Group L.P., to fund oil and natural gas development (\u201cDrillCo\u201d) and Quantum Energy Partners (\u201cQuantum\u201d) to fund selected future oil and natural gas acquisitions and the development of those acquired assets through a new entity (\u201cAcqCo\u201d).\nAchieving the anticipated benefits of DrillCo will depend in part on whether we and GSO are able to agree on a drilling plan during any of the five years of the term of DrillCo, as well as our ability to execute on that drilling plan. Achieving the anticipated benefits of AcqCo will depend in part on whether we are able to come to an agreement with Quantum and AcqCo regarding identification and acquisition of suitable assets for AcqCo, whether we are able to fund the acquisition of our required minimum working interest in such assets and ultimately whether we are able to purchase back assets from AcqCo after they have matured into conventional MLP assets. An inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of these alliances may affect our ability to accomplish the objectives identified above.\nIf we are unable to replace declines in production, proved developed producing reserves and cash flow, our net cash provided by operating activities could be reduced, which could adversely affect our ability to service debt or to resume payment of distributions to our unitholders.\nIn determining the amount of cash that we distribute to unitholders, if any, our Board of Directors establishes at the end of each year an amount of capital expenditures for the next year (which we refer to as discretionary reductions for a portion of oil and natural gas development costs) with the objective of replacing proved developed producing reserves, current production and cash flow, taking into consideration our overall commodity mix. Management evaluates all of these objectives as part of the decision-making process to determine the discretionary reductions for a portion of oil and natural gas development costs for the year, although every objective may not be met in each year. Furthermore, there may be certain years in which commodity prices and other economic conditions do not merit capital spending at a level sufficient to accomplish any of these objectives.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\nIn determining this portion of oil and natural gas development costs (which may include estimated drilling and development costs associated with projects to convert a portion of non-producing reserves to producing status but does not include the historical cost of acquired properties as those amounts have already been spent in prior periods and were financed primarily with external sources of funding), management evaluates historical results of our drilling and development activities based on periodically revised and updated information from past years to assess the costs, adequacy and effectiveness of such activities and future assumptions regarding cost trends, production and decline rates and reserve recoveries. However, our management does not conduct an analysis to evaluate historical amounts of capital actually spent on such drilling and development activities. Our ability to pursue projects with the intent to replace proved developed producing reserves, current production and cash flow through drilling and development activities is limited to our inventory of development opportunities on our existing acreage position. Management\u2019s estimate of this discretionary portion of our oil and natural gas development costs does not include the historical acquisition cost of projects pursued during the year or the acquisition of new oil and natural gas reserves. Moreover, our assumptions regarding costs, production and decline rates and reserve recoveries may prove to be incorrect. After establishing the amount of discretionary reductions for a portion of oil and natural gas development costs, if we do not fully replace proved developed producing reserves, current production and cash flow, our net cash provided by operating activities could be reduced, which could adversely affect our ability to service debt or to resume payment of distributions to our unitholders. Furthermore, our existing reserves, inventory of drilling locations and production levels will decline over time as a result of development and production activities. Consequently, if we were to limit our total capital expenditures to this discretionary portion of our oil and natural gas development costs and not complete acquisitions of new reserves, total reserves would decrease over time, resulting in an inability to sustain production at current levels, which could also adversely affect our ability to service debt and to resume payment of distributions to our unitholders.\nOur commodity derivative activities could result in financial losses or could reduce our income, which may adversely affect our net cash provided by operating activities, financial condition and results of operations.\nTo achieve more predictable net cash provided by operating activities and to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in the prices of oil and natural gas, we have entered into commodity derivative contracts for a portion of our production. Commodity derivative arrangements expose us to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including situations when production is less than expected. If we experience a sustained material interruption in our production or if we are unable to perform our drilling activity as planned, we might be forced to satisfy all or a portion of our derivative obligations without the benefit of the sale of our underlying physical commodity, which may adversely affect our net cash provided by operating activities, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to hedge additional anticipated production volumes on attractive terms or at all, which would subject us to further potential commodity price uncertainty and could adversely affect our net cash provided by operating activities, financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough LINN Energy has hedged a significant portion of its natural gas production through 2017, its oil production is hedged to a lesser extent for 2016 and beyond, and its NGL production is completely unhedged. In addition, Berry\u2019s oil production is completed unhedged. Based on current expectations for continued low future commodity prices, reduced hedging market liquidity and potential reduced counterparty willingness to enter into new hedges with us, we may be unable to hedge additional anticipated production volumes on attractive terms or at all, which would subject us to further potential commodity price uncertainty and could adversely affect our net cash provided by operating activities, financial condition and results of operations.\nCounterparty failure may adversely affect our derivative positions.\nWe cannot be assured that our counterparties will be able to perform under our derivative contracts. If a counterparty fails to perform and the derivative arrangement is terminated, our net cash provided by operating activities, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nDerivatives legislation and implementing rules could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business.\nTitle VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), enacted in 2010, expands federal oversight and regulation of the derivatives market and entities, such as us, that participate in that market. Those markets involve derivative transactions, which include certain instruments, such as interest rate swaps, forward\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\ncontracts, option contracts, financial contracts and other contracts, used in our risk management activities. The Dodd-Frank Act requires that most swaps ultimately will be cleared through a registered clearing facility and that they be traded on a designated exchange or swap execution facility, with certain exceptions for entities that use swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk. The Dodd-Frank requirements relating to derivative transactions have not been fully implemented by the SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission. When fully implemented, the law and any new regulations could increase the operational and transactional cost of derivatives contracts and affect the number and/or creditworthiness of available counterparties.\nIn addition, we may transact with counterparties based in the European Union, Canada or other jurisdictions which, like the U.S., are in the process of implementing regulations to regulate derivatives transactions, some of which are currently in effect and impose operational and transactional costs on our derivatives activities.\nUnless we replace our reserves, our future reserves and production will decline, which would adversely affect our net cash provided by operating activities, financial condition and results of operations.\nProducing oil, natural gas and NGL reservoirs are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending on reservoir characteristics and other factors. The overall rate of decline for our production will change if production from our existing wells declines in a different manner than we have estimated and can change when we drill additional wells, make acquisitions and under other circumstances. Thus, our future oil, natural gas and NGL reserves and production and, therefore, our cash flow and income, are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. We may not be able to develop, find or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs, which would adversely affect our net cash provided by operating activities, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, given our significant level of indebtedness, current market conditions and restrictive covenants under our debt agreements, we may be unable to finance such potential acquisitions of reserves on terms that are acceptable to us or at all. Our ability to make the necessary capital investment to maintain or expand our asset base of oil and natural gas reserves would be impaired to the extent cash flow from operations is reduced and external sources of capital become limited or unavailable. We may not be successful in exploring for, developing or acquiring additional reserves. We also may not be successful in raising funds to acquire additional reserves.\nOur estimated reserves are based on many assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\nNo one can measure underground accumulations of oil, natural gas and NGL in an exact manner. Reserve engineering requires subjective estimates of underground accumulations of oil, natural gas and NGL and assumptions concerning future oil, natural gas and NGL prices, production levels and operating and development costs. As a result, estimated quantities of proved reserves and projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may prove to be inaccurate. An independent petroleum engineering firm prepares estimates of our proved reserves. Some of our reserve estimates are made without the benefit of a lengthy production history, which are less reliable than estimates based on a lengthy production history. Also, we make certain assumptions regarding future oil, natural gas and NGL prices, production levels and operating and development costs that may prove incorrect. Any significant variance from these assumptions by actual amounts could greatly affect our estimates of reserves, the economically recoverable quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL attributable to any particular group of properties, the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of the future net cash flows. Decreases in commodity prices can result in a reduction of our estimated reserves if development of those reserves would not be economic at those lower prices. Numerous changes over time to the assumptions on which our reserve estimates are based, as described above, often result in the actual quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL we ultimately recover being different from our reserve estimates.\nThe present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated oil, natural gas and NGL reserves. We base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on an unweighted average of the first-day-of-the month price for each month during the 12-month calendar year and year-end costs. However, actual future net cash flows from our oil and natural gas properties also will be affected by factors such as:\n\u2022\nactual prices we receive for oil, natural gas and NGL;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of actual production;\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\n\u2022\ncapital and operating expenditures;\n\u2022\nthe timing and success of development activities;\n\u2022\nsupply of and demand for oil, natural gas and NGL; and\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulations or taxation.\nIn addition, the 10% discount factor required to be used under the provisions of applicable accounting standards when calculating discounted future net cash flows, may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and natural gas industry in general.\nOur development operations require substantial capital expenditures, which will reduce our cash available to service debt. We may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, which could lead to a decline in our reserves.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive. We make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our business for the development and production of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves. These expenditures will reduce our cash available to service debt or to resume payment of distributions to our unitholders. We intend to finance our future capital expenditures primarily with net cash provided by operating activities. Our net cash provided by operating activities and access to capital are subject to a number of variables, including:\n\u2022\nour proved reserves;\n\u2022\nthe level of oil, natural gas and NGL we are able to produce from existing wells;\n\u2022\nthe prices at which we are able to sell our oil, natural gas and NGL;\n\u2022\nthe level of operating expenses; and\n\u2022\nour ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves.\nIf our net cash provided by operating activities or the borrowing bases under our Credit Facilities decrease, we may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations at current levels. In addition, as noted previously, our Credit Facilities are effectively fully drawn, precluding our ability to utilize our Credit Facilities to fund our operations. Our Credit Facilities also restrict our ability to obtain new financing. If additional capital is needed, we may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms favorable to us, or at all. If net cash provided by operating activities or cash available under our Credit Facilities is not sufficient to meet our capital requirements, the failure to obtain such additional debt or equity financing could result in a curtailment of our development operations, which in turn could lead to a decline in our reserves.\nWe may decide not to drill some of the prospects we have identified, and locations that we decide to drill may not yield oil, natural gas and NGL in commercially viable quantities.\nOur prospective drilling locations are in various stages of evaluation, ranging from a prospect that is ready to drill to a prospect that will require additional geological and engineering analysis. Based on a variety of factors, including future oil, natural gas and NGL prices, the generation of additional seismic or geological information, the current and future availability of drilling rigs and other factors, we may decide not to drill one or more of these prospects. In addition, the cost of drilling, completing and operating a well is often uncertain, and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a well. Our efforts will be uneconomic if we drill dry holes or wells that are productive but do not produce enough oil, natural gas and NGL to be commercially viable after drilling, operating and other costs. As a result, we may not be able to increase or sustain our reserves or production, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe SEC\u2019s reserve reporting rules include a general requirement that, subject to limited exceptions, proved undeveloped reserves may only be recorded if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years. As a result of the uncertainty regarding our future commitment to capital, we reclassified all of our proved undeveloped reserves to unproved as of December 31, 2015. See Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d for details regarding our going concern uncertainty.\nOur business depends on gathering and transportation facilities. Any limitation in the availability of those facilities would interfere with our ability to market the oil, natural gas and NGL we produce, and could reduce our cash available to\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\nservice debt or to resume payment of distributions to our unitholders and adversely impact expected increases in oil, natural gas and NGL production from our drilling program.\nThe marketability of our oil, natural gas and NGL production depends in part on the availability, proximity and capacity of gathering systems and pipelines. The amount of oil, natural gas and NGL that can be produced and sold is subject to limitation in certain circumstances, such as pipeline interruptions due to scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, excessive pressure, physical damage to the gathering or transportation system, or lack of contracted capacity on such systems. The curtailments arising from these and similar circumstances may last from a few days to several months. In many cases, we are provided only with limited, if any, notice as to when these circumstances will arise and their duration. In addition, some of our wells are drilled in locations that are not serviced by gathering and transportation pipelines, or the gathering and transportation pipelines in the area may not have sufficient capacity to transport additional production. As a result, we may not be able to sell the oil, natural gas and NGL production from these wells until the necessary gathering and transportation systems are constructed. Any significant curtailment in gathering system or pipeline capacity, or significant delay in the construction of necessary gathering and transportation facilities, would interfere with our ability to market the oil, natural gas and NGL we produce, and could reduce our cash available to service debt or to resume payment of distributions to our unitholders and adversely impact expected increases in oil, natural gas and NGL production from our drilling program.\nWe depend on certain key customers for sales of our oil, natural gas and NGL. To the extent these and other customers reduce the volumes they purchase from us or delay payment, our revenues and cash available to service debt or to resume payment of distributions to our unitholders could decline. Further, a general increase in nonpayment could have an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, sales of oil, natural gas and NGL to Phillips 66 accounted for approximately 12% of our sales. To the extent this and other customers reduce the volumes of oil, natural gas or NGL that they purchase from us, our revenues and cash available to service debt or to resume payment of distributions to our unitholders could decline.\nWe may be unable to retain key employees.\nOur future success will depend in part on our ability to retain key employees. Since the fourth quarter of 2014, the prices of oil, natural gas and NGL have been extremely volatile, have declined significantly and downward pressure on commodity prices may continue for the foreseeable future. Key employees may depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty during times of commodity price volatility. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that we will be able to retain key employees to the same extent as in the past.\nMany of our leases are in areas that have been partially depleted or drained by offset wells.\nMany of our leases are in areas that have already been partially depleted or drained by earlier offset drilling. This may inhibit our ability to find economically recoverable quantities of reserves in these areas. Our identified drilling location inventories are scheduled out over several years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDrilling for and producing oil, natural gas and NGL are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows and, as a result, our ability to service debt or to resume payment of distributions to our unitholders.\nOur drilling activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that we will not discover commercially productive reservoirs. Drilling for oil, natural gas and NGL can be uneconomic, not only from dry holes, but also from productive wells that do not produce sufficient revenues to be commercially viable. In addition, our drilling and producing operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of other factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe high cost, shortages or delivery delays of equipment and services;\n\u2022\nunexpected operational events;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions;\n\u2022\nfacility or equipment malfunctions;\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\n\u2022\ntitle problems;\n\u2022\npipeline ruptures or spills;\n\u2022\ncompliance with environmental and other governmental requirements;\n\u2022\nunusual or unexpected geological formations;\n\u2022\nloss of drilling fluid circulation;\n\u2022\nformations with abnormal pressures;\n\u2022\nfires;\n\u2022\nblowouts, craterings and explosions; and\n\u2022\nuncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas and NGL or well fluids.\nAny of these events can cause increased costs or restrict our ability to drill the wells and conduct the operations which we currently have planned. Any delay in the drilling program or significant increase in costs could impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flows, and as a result, our ability to service debt or to resume payment of distributions to our unitholders.\nWe have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate.\nOther companies operate some of the properties in which we have an interest. As of December 31, 2015, nonoperated wells represented approximately 28% of our owned gross wells, or approximately 11% of our owned net wells. We have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these nonoperated properties, including timing of drilling and other scheduled operations activities, compliance with environmental, safety and other regulations, or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to them. The failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations, an operator\u2019s breach of the applicable agreements or an operator\u2019s failure to act in ways that are in our best interest could reduce our production and revenues, and lead to unexpected future costs.\nBecause we handle oil, natural gas and NGL and other hydrocarbons, we may incur significant costs and liabilities in the future resulting from a failure to comply with new or existing environmental regulations or an accidental release of hazardous substances into the environment.\nThe operations of our wells, gathering systems, turbines, pipelines and other facilities are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of remedial requirements, and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations. There is an inherent risk that we may incur environmental costs and liabilities due to the nature of our business and the substances we handle. Certain environmental statutes, including the RCRA, CERCLA and analogous state laws and regulations, impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances have been disposed of or otherwise released. In addition, an accidental release from one of our wells or gathering pipelines could subject us to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup and restoration costs, claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage and fines or penalties for related violations of environmental laws or regulations.\nMoreover, the possibility exists that stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase our compliance costs and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary, and these costs may not be recoverable from insurance. For a more detailed discussion of environmental and regulatory matters impacting our business, see Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Environmental Matters and Regulation.\u201d\nWe are subject to complex federal, state, local and other laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.\nOur operations are regulated extensively at the federal, state and local levels. Environmental and other governmental laws and regulations have resulted in delays and increased the costs to plan, design, drill, install, operate and abandon oil and natural gas wells. Under these laws and regulations, we could also be liable for personal injuries, property damage and other damages. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties. Moreover, public interest in environmental protection has increased in recent years, and environmental organizations have opposed, with some success, certain drilling projects.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\nPart of the regulatory environment in which we operate includes, in some cases, legal requirements for obtaining environmental assessments, environmental impact studies and/or plans of development before commencing drilling and production activities. In addition, our activities are subject to the regulations regarding conservation practices and protection of correlative rights. These regulations affect our operations and limit the quantity of oil, natural gas and NGL we may produce and sell. A major risk inherent in our drilling plans is the need to obtain drilling permits from state and local authorities. Delays in obtaining regulatory approvals or drilling permits, the failure to obtain a drilling permit for a well or the receipt of a permit with unreasonable conditions or costs could have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop our properties. Additionally, the regulatory environment could change in ways that might substantially increase the financial and managerial costs of compliance with these laws and regulations and, consequently, adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, as well as our ability to service debt or to resume payment of distributions to our unitholders. For a description of the laws and regulations that affect us, see Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Environmental Matters and Regulation.\u201d\nLegislation and regulation of hydraulic fracturing could adversely affect our business.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight formations. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. For a description of the laws and regulations that affect us, including our hydraulic fracturing operations, see Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Environmental Matters and Regulation.\u201d If adopted, certain bills could result in additional permitting requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations as well as various restrictions on those operations. Any such added regulation could lead to operational delays, increased operating costs and additional regulatory burdens, and reduced production of oil and natural gas, which could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and net cash provided by operating activities.\nWe use a significant amount of water in our hydraulic fracturing operations. Our inability to locate sufficient amounts of water, or dispose of or recycle water used in our drilling and production operations, could adversely impact our operations. Moreover, new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of waste, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the development or production of natural gas.\nFinally, in some instances, the operation of underground injection wells has been alleged to cause earthquakes. Such issues have sometimes led to orders prohibiting continued injection in certain wells identified as possible sources of seismic activity. Such concerns also have resulted in stricter regulatory requirements in some jurisdictions relating to the location and operation of underground injection wells. Future orders or regulations addressing concerns about seismic activity from well injection could affect us, either directly or indirectly, depending on the wells affected.\nLegislation and regulation of greenhouse gases could adversely affect our business.\nIn December 2009, the Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201c) determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d (\u201cGHG\u201d) present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA has begun adopting and implementing regulations to restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act (\u201cCAA\u201d). The EPA has adopted three sets of rules regulating GHG emissions under the CAA, one that requires a reduction in emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles, a second that regulates emissions of GHGs from certain large stationary sources under the CAA\u2019s Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V permitting programs, and a third that regulates GHG emissions from fossil fuel-burning power plants. In addition, in September 2015, the EPA published a proposed rule that would update and expand the New Source Performance Standards by setting additional emissions limits for volatile organic compounds and regulating methane emissions from new and modified sources in the oil and gas industry. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified sources in the U.S., including, among other things, certain onshore oil and natural gas production facilities, on an annual basis. In addition, in 2015, the U.S. participated in the United Nations Conference on Climate Change, which led to the creation of the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement will be open for signing on April 22, 2016, and will require countries to review and \u201crepresent a progression\u201d in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set GHG emission reduction goals, every five years beginning in 2020. Legislation has from time to time been introduced in Congress that would establish measures restricting GHG emissions in the U.S. At the state level, almost one half of the states,\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\nincluding California, have begun taking actions to control and/or reduce emissions of GHGs. For a description of the California \u201ccap and trade\u201d program, see Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Environmental Matters and Regulation.\u201d Any such added regulation could lead to operational delays, increased operating costs and additional regulatory burdens, and reduced production of oil and natural gas, which could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and net cash provided by operating activities.\nRecent regulatory changes in California have and may continue to adversely affect our production and operating costs related to our Diatomite assets.\nRecent regulatory changes in California have impacted production from our Diatomite assets. In 2010, Diatomite production decreased significantly due to the inability to drill new wells pending the receipt of permits from the California Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources (\u201cDOGGR\u201d). Berry received a new full-field development approval in late July 2011 from DOGGR, which contained stringent operating requirements. Revisions to the July 2011 project approval letter were received in February 2012. Implementation of these new operating requirements negatively impacted the pace of drilling and steam injection and increased Berry\u2019s operating costs for its Diatomite assets. The requirements continued to affect Berry\u2019s operations through 2015, and we may not be successful in streamlining the review process with DOGGR or in taking additional steps to more efficiently manage our operations to avoid additional delays. In addition, DOGGR may impose additional operational restrictions or requirements. For example, currently DOGGR is developing new regulations for shallow, thermal Diatomite. In such case, we may experience additional delays in production and increased operating costs related to our Diatomite assets, which could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and net cash provided by operating activities.\nWe may issue additional units without unitholder approval, which would dilute existing ownership interests.\nWe may issue an unlimited number of limited liability company interests of any type, including units, without the approval of our unitholders.\nThe issuance of additional units or other equity securities may have the following effects:\n\u2022\nan individual unitholder\u2019s proportionate ownership interest in us may decrease;\n\u2022\nthe relative voting strength of each previously outstanding unit may be reduced;\n\u2022\nthe amount of cash available for distribution per unit may decrease; and\n\u2022\nthe market price of the units may decline.\nOur management may have conflicts of interest with the unitholders. Our limited liability company agreement limits the remedies available to our unitholders in the event unitholders have a claim relating to conflicts of interest.\nConflicts of interest may arise between our management on one hand, and the Company and our unitholders on the other hand, related to the divergent interests of our management. Situations in which the interests of our management may differ from interests of our nonaffiliated unitholders include, among others, the following situations:\n\u2022\nour limited liability company agreement gives our Board of Directors broad discretion in establishing cash reserves for the proper conduct of our business, which will affect the amount of cash available for distributions to our unitholders. For example, our management will use its reasonable discretion to establish and maintain cash reserves sufficient to fund our drilling program, and may also determine to reduce indebtedness;\n\u2022\nour management team, subject to oversight from our Board of Directors, determines the timing and extent of our drilling program and related capital expenditures, asset purchases and sales, borrowings, issuances of additional units and reserve adjustments, all of which will affect the amount of cash available to service debt or to resume payment of distributions to our unitholders; and\n\u2022\naffiliates of our directors are not prohibited from investing or engaging in other businesses or activities that compete with the Company.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\nYour units are subject to limited call rights that could result in your having to involuntarily sell your units at a time or price that may be undesirable.\nIf at any time a person owns more than 90% of our outstanding units, such person may elect to purchase all, but not less than all, of our remaining outstanding units at a price equal to the higher of the current market price (as defined in our limited liability company agreement) and the highest price paid by such person or any of its affiliates for any of our units purchased during the 90-day period preceding the date notice was mailed to the our unitholders informing them of such election. In this case, you will be required to tender all of your outstanding units and you may receive a payment that is effectively less than the price at which you would prefer to sell your units.\nUnitholders who are not \u201cEligible Holders\u201d will be subject to redemption of their units.\nIn order to comply with U.S. laws with respect to the ownership of interests in oil and natural gas leases on federal lands, we have adopted certain requirements regarding those investors who may own our units. As used herein, an Eligible Holder means a person or entity qualified to hold an interest in oil and natural gas leases on federal lands. Unitholders who are not persons or entities who meet the requirements to be an Eligible Holder will not be entitled to receive distributions in kind on their units in a liquidation and they run the risk of having their units redeemed by us at the then-current market price.\nTax Risks\nWe are exploring strategic alternatives to strengthen our balance sheet and maximize our value. We may consider alternatives that could have significant adverse tax consequences to our unitholders.\nWe are exploring strategic alternatives to strengthen our balance sheet and maximize our value. We may consider alternatives that could have significant adverse tax consequences to our unitholders. For example, we may engage in additional transactions that result in significant cancellation of debt (\u201cCOD\u201d) income to our unitholders. As described below, any COD income may cause a unitholder to be allocated income with respect to our units with no corresponding distribution of cash to fund the payment of the resulting tax liability to the unitholder. In addition, we may engage in transactions that trigger a unitholder\u2019s tax gain or loss with respect to our units. A transaction that triggers a unitholder\u2019s gain may not be accompanied by any receipt of cash to fund the payment of the resulting tax liability to the unitholder. Under certain circumstances, a unitholder\u2019s loss upon any such transaction may be permanently disallowed.\nWe urge our unitholders to consult their tax advisors regarding the potential adverse effects of the various strategic alternatives that may be available to us.\nUnitholders are required to pay taxes on their share of our taxable income, including their share of ordinary income and capital gain upon dispositions of properties by us or cancellation of debt, even if they do not receive any cash distributions from us to fund any resulting tax liability. A unitholder\u2019s share of our taxable income, gain, loss and deduction, or specific items thereof, may be substantially different than the unitholder\u2019s interest in our economic profits.\nOur unitholders are required to pay federal income taxes and, in some cases, state and local income taxes on their share of our taxable income, whether or not they receive any cash distributions from us. Even if our distributions are reinstated, our unitholders may not receive cash distributions from us equal to their share of our taxable income or even equal to the actual tax liability that results from their share of our taxable income.\nFor example, a unitholder\u2019s share of our taxable income will include any COD income recognized upon the satisfaction of our outstanding indebtedness for total consideration less than the adjusted issue price (and any accrued but unpaid interest) of such indebtedness. During 2015, we repurchased and exchanged approximately $3.0 billion of our outstanding senior notes at a significant discount, resulting in substantial COD income. We may engage in other transactions that result in COD income in the future. Depending upon the net amount of other items related to our loss (or income) allocable to a unitholder, any COD income may cause a unitholder to be allocated income with respect to our units with no corresponding distribution of cash to fund the payment of the resulting tax liability to the unitholder. Furthermore, such COD income event may not be fully offset, either now or in the future, by capital losses, which are subject to significant limitations, or other losses. Accordingly, a COD income event could cause a unitholder to realize taxable income without corresponding future economic benefits or offsetting tax deductions.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\nIn addition, we may sell a portion of our properties and use the proceeds to pay down debt or acquire other properties rather than distributing the proceeds to our unitholders, and some or all of our unitholders may be allocated substantial taxable income or loss with respect to that sale. A unitholder\u2019s share of our taxable income upon a disposition of property by us may be ordinary income or capital gain or some combination thereof. Even where we dispose of properties that are capital assets, what otherwise would be capital gains may be recharacterized as ordinary income in order to \u201crecapture\u201d ordinary deductions that were previously allocated to that unitholder related to the same properties.\nA unitholder\u2019s share of our taxable income and gain (or specific items thereof) may be substantially greater than, or our tax losses and deductions (or specific items thereof) may be substantially less than, the unitholder\u2019s interest in our economic profits. This may occur, for example, in the case of a unitholder who purchases units at a time when the value of our units or of one or more of our properties is relatively low or a unitholder who acquires units directly from us in exchange for property whose fair market value exceeds its tax basis at the time of the exchange. Cash distributions from us decrease a unitholder\u2019s tax basis in its units, and the amount, if any, of excess distributions over a unitholder\u2019s tax basis in its units will, in effect, become taxable income to the unitholder, above and beyond the unitholder\u2019s share of our taxable income and gain (or specific items thereof).\nOur tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, as well as our not being subject to a material amount of additional entity level taxation by individual states. If the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) were to treat us as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or we were to become subject to material additional entity level taxation for state tax purposes, taxes paid, if any, would reduce the amount of cash available to service debt or to resume payment of distributions to our unitholders.\nThe anticipated after-tax economic benefit of an investment in our units depends largely on us being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. We have not requested, and do not currently plan to request, a ruling from the IRS on this or any other tax matter that affects us.\nIf we were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we would pay federal income tax on our taxable income at the corporate tax rates, currently at a maximum rate of 35%. Distributions, if any, would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions, and no income, gain, loss, deduction or credit would flow through to unitholders. Because a tax may be imposed on us as a corporation, our cash available to service debt or to resume payment of distributions to our unitholders could be reduced.\nCurrent law or our business may change and cause us to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject us to entity level taxation. Any modification to current law or interpretations thereof may or may not be applied retroactively and could make it more difficult or impossible to meet the requirements for partnership status, affect or cause us to change our business activities, affect the tax considerations of an investment in us, change the character or treatment of portions of our income and adversely affect an investment in our units.\nIn addition, because of widespread state budget deficits and other reasons, several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships and limited liability companies to entity level taxation through the imposition of state income, franchise or other forms of taxation. For example, we may be required to pay Texas franchise tax on our total revenue apportioned to Texas at a maximum effective rate of approximately 0.5%. Imposition of a similar entity-level tax on our income or receipts by any other state would reduce the amount of cash available to service debt or to resume payment of distributions to our unitholders.\nA successful IRS contest of the federal income tax positions we take may adversely affect the market for our units, and the cost of an IRS contest will reduce our cash available to service debt or to resume payment of distributions to our unitholders.\nThe IRS may adopt tax positions that differ from the positions we take. It may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings to sustain some or all of the positions we take. A court may not agree with some or all of the positions we take. Any contest with the IRS may materially and adversely impact the market for our units and the price at which they trade, as well as reduce our cash available to service debt or to resume payment of distributions to our unitholders.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\nIf the IRS makes audit adjustments to our income tax returns for tax years beginning after 2017, it (and some states) may collect any resulting taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) directly from us, in which case our cash available to service debt or to pay distributions to our unitholders, if and when resumed, might be substantially reduced.\nPursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, if the IRS makes audit adjustments to our income tax returns for tax years beginning after 2017, it may collect any resulting taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) directly from us. We will generally have the ability to shift any such tax liability to our unitholders in accordance with their interests in us during the year under audit, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so (and will choose to do so) under all circumstances, or that we will be able to (or choose to) effect corresponding shifts in state income or similar tax liability resulting from the IRS adjustment in states in which we do business in the year under audit or in the adjustment year. If we make payments of taxes, penalties and interest resulting from audit adjustments, our cash available to service debt or to resume payment of distributions to our unitholders could be reduced.\nA unitholder\u2019s taxable gain or loss on the disposition of our units could be more or less than expected.\nIf unitholders sell their units, they will recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and their tax basis in those units. Prior distributions to our unitholders in excess of the total net taxable income they were allocated for a unit, which decreases their tax basis, will become taxable income to our unitholders if the unit is sold at a price greater than their tax basis in that unit, even if the price received is less than their original cost.\nA substantial portion of the amount realized, whether or not representing gain, may be ordinary income. In addition, if unitholders sell their units, they may incur a tax liability in excess of the amount of cash they receive from the sale. If the IRS successfully contests some positions we take, unitholders could recognize more gain on the sale of units than would be the case under those positions, without the benefit of decreased income in prior years.\nTax-exempt entities and non-U.S. persons face unique tax issues from owning our units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them.\nInvestment in units by tax-exempt entities, such as individual retirement accounts (known as IRAs) and other retirement plans, and non-U.S. persons raises issues unique to them. For example, virtually all of our income allocated to organizations that are exempt from federal income tax, including IRAs and other retirement plans, will be unrelated business taxable income and will be taxable to them. Distributions to non-U.S. persons will be reduced by withholding taxes at the highest applicable effective tax rate, and non-U.S. persons will be required to file U.S. federal tax returns and pay tax on their share of our taxable income.\nWe treat each purchaser of units as having the same economic and tax characteristics without regard to the units purchased. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could adversely affect the value of the units.\nBecause we cannot match transferors and transferees of units, we must maintain uniformity of the economic and tax characteristics of our units to a purchaser of units. We take depletion, depreciation and amortization and other positions that are intended to maintain such uniformity. These positions may not conform with all aspects of existing Treasury regulations and may affect the amount or timing of income, gain, loss or deduction allocable to a unitholder or the amount of gain from a unitholder\u2019s sale of units. A successful IRS challenge to those positions could also adversely affect the amount or timing of income, gain, loss or deduction allocable to a unitholder, or the amount of gain from a unitholder\u2019s sale of units and could have a negative impact on the value of our units or result in audit adjustments to unitholders tax returns.\nWe prorate our items of income, gain, loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our units each month (or in some cases for periods shorter than a month) based upon the ownership of our units on the first day of each month (or shorter period), instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss and deduction among our unitholders.\nWe prorate our items of income, gain, loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our units each month (or in some cases for periods shorter than a month) based upon the ownership of our units on the first day of each month (or shorter period), instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred. The use of this proration method may not be\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\npermitted under existing Treasury regulations. If the IRS were to challenge this method or new Treasury regulations were issued, we may be required to change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss and deduction among our unitholders.\nThe sale or exchange of 50% or more of our capital and profits interests within a 12-month period will result in the deemed termination of our tax partnership for federal income tax purposes.\nWe will be considered to have terminated for federal income tax purposes if there is a sale or exchange of 50% or more of the total interests in our capital and profits within a 12-month period. Our termination would, among other things, result in the closing of our taxable year for all unitholders and could result in a deferral of depreciation deductions allowable in computing our taxable income. If this occurs, our unitholders will be allocated an increased amount of federal taxable income for the year in which we are considered to be terminated as a percentage of the cash distributed to the unitholders with respect to that period.\nA unitholder whose units are loaned to a \u201cshort seller\u201d to cover a short sale of units may be considered as having disposed of those units. If so, the unitholder would no longer be treated for tax purposes as a partner with respect to those units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition.\nBecause a unitholder whose units are loaned to a \u201cshort seller\u201d to cover a short sale of units may be considered as having disposed of the loaned units, the unitholder may no longer be treated for tax purposes as a partner with respect to those units during the period of the loan to the short seller and the unitholder may recognize gain or loss from such disposition. Moreover, during the period of the loan to the short seller, any of our income, gain, loss, or deduction with respect to those units may not be reportable by the unitholder and any cash distributions received by the unitholder as to those units could be fully taxable as ordinary income. Unitholders desiring to assure their status as partners and avoid the risk of gain recognition from a loan to a short seller are urged to modify any applicable brokerage account agreements to prohibit their brokers from borrowing their units.\nUnitholders may be subject to state and local taxes and return filing requirements in states and jurisdictions where they do not live as a result of investing in our units.\nIn addition to federal income taxes, our unitholders will likely be subject to other taxes, including state and local taxes, unincorporated business taxes and estate, inheritance or intangible taxes that are imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we do business or own property now or in the future, even if they do not reside in any of those jurisdictions. Our unitholders will likely be required to file foreign, state and local income tax returns and pay state and local income taxes in some or all of these jurisdictions. Further, our unitholders may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with those requirements. In 2015, we have been registered to do business or have owned assets in Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, Utah and Wyoming. As we make acquisitions or expand our business, we may do business or own assets in other states in the future. It is the responsibility of each unitholder to file all U.S. federal, state and local tax returns that may be required of such unitholder.\nChanges to current federal tax laws may affect the tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships or unitholders\u2019 ability to take certain tax deductions, possibly on a retroactive basis.\nSubstantive changes to the existing federal income tax laws have been proposed that, if adopted, would affect, among other things, the ability to take certain operations-related deductions, including deductions for intangible drilling and deductions for U.S. production activities. Other proposed changes may affect our ability to remain taxable as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or tax publicly traded partnerships with qualifying income from fossil fuels activities as a corporation. Additionally, in May 2015, the IRS and the U.S. Department of the Treasury published proposed regulations that provide industry-specific guidance regarding whether income earned from certain activities will constitute qualifying income. We are unable to predict whether any changes, or other proposals to such laws, ultimately will be enacted or, if enacted, will be applied retroactively, or whether proposed regulations, once issued in final form, will materially change interpretations of the current law. Any such changes could negatively impact the value of an investment in our units.", "PERMNO": 18246, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "ROAN"}
