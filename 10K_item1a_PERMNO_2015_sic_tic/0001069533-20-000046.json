Risk Factors\nPlease carefully consider the risks described below regarding the Company. These risks are not the only ones faced by the Company. Additional risks not presently known to the Company or that the Company currently believes are immaterial may also impair business operations and financial results. If any of the following risks actually occur, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock could decline and investors could lose all or part of their investment. The risk factors below are categorized by operational, regulatory, financial and general:\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\nAvailability of sufficient and reliable pipeline capacity.\nThe Company is currently served directly by two interstate pipelines. These two pipelines carry 100% of the natural gas transported to the Company\u2019s distribution system. Depending on weather conditions and the level of customer demand, failure of one or both of these interstate transmission pipelines could have a major impact on the Company\u2019s ability to meet customer demand for natural gas and adversely affect the Company\u2019s earnings as a result of lost revenue and the cost of service restoration. Frequent or prolonged failure could lead customers to switch to alternative energy sources. Capacity limitations on existing pipeline and storage infrastructure could impact the Company\u2019s ability to obtain additional natural gas supplies, thereby limiting its ability to meet customer demand and thereby limiting future earnings potential.\nRisks associated with the operation of a natural gas distribution pipeline and LNG storage facility.\nNumerous potential risks are inherent in the operation of a natural gas distribution system and LNG storage facility, including unanticipated or unforeseen events that are beyond the control of the Company. Examples of such events include adverse weather conditions, acts of terrorism or sabotage, accidents and damage caused by third parties, equipment failure, failure of upstream pipelines and storage facilities, as well as catastrophic events such as explosions, fires, earthquakes, floods, or other similar events. These risks could result in injury or loss of life, property damage, pollution and customer service disruption resulting in potentially significant financial losses. The Company maintains insurance coverage to protect against many of these risks. However, if losses result from an event that is not fully covered by insurance, the Company\u2019s financial condition could be significantly impacted if it were unable to recover such losses from customers through the regulatory rate making process. Even if the Company did not incur a direct financial loss as a result of any of the events noted above, it could encounter significant reputational damage from a reliability, safety, integrity or similar viewpoint, potentially resulting in a longer-term negative earnings impact or decline in share price.\nSupply disruptions due to weather or other forces.\nHurricanes, floods, fires and other natural or man-made disasters could damage or inhibit production and/or pipeline transportation facilities, which could result in decreased natural gas supplies. Decreased supplies could result in an inability to meet customer demand, service new franchise areas or lead to higher prices and/or service disruptions. Disasters could increase costs to repair damaged facilities and result in delays to restore service to interrupted customers as well as lead to additional governmental regulations that may limit production activity and/or increase production and transportation costs.\nSecurity incident or cyber-attacks on the Company\u2019s computer or information technology systems.\nThe Company\u2019s business operations and information technology systems may be vulnerable to an attack by individuals or organizations intending to disrupt the operations of the Company. Such an attack or cyber-security incident on the Company\u2019s information technology systems could result in corruption of the Company\u2019s financial information; the unauthorized release of confidential customer, employee or vendor information; the interruption of natural gas deliveries to our customers; or compromise the safety of our distribution, transmission and storage systems. The Company has implemented policies, procedures and controls to prevent and detect these activities; however, there are no guarantees that Company processes will adequately protect against unauthorized access. In the event of a successful attack, the Company could be exposed to material financial and reputational risks, possible disruptions in natural gas deliveries or a compromise of the safety of the natural gas distribution system, as well as be exposed to claims by persons harmed by such an attack, all of which could materially increase the Company's costs to protect against such risks. Resources maintains cyber-insurance coverage, which does not protect the Company from cyber incidents but does provide some level of protection to mitigate the financial impacts resulting from such attacks.\nVolatility in the price and availability of natural gas.\nNatural gas purchases represent the single largest expense of the Company. Even with increasing demand from other areas, including electricity generation, natural gas prices are currently expected to remain stable in the near term, although there can be no guarantee to that effect. If demand for natural gas increases at a rate in excess of current expectations, natural gas prices could face upward pressure. Increasing natural gas prices could result in declining sales as well as increases in bad debt expense and increased competition from other energy providers.\nInability to attract and retain professional and technical employees.\nThe ability to implement the Company\u2019s business strategy and serve customers is dependent upon employing talented professionals and attracting, training, developing and retaining a skilled workforce. As the Company is facing retirements of key personnel over the next several years, the failure to transition the skills and knowledge of the\ndeparting employees to qualified existing or new employees could increase operating costs and expose the Company to other operational, reputational and financial risks.\nGeographic concentration of business activities.\nThe Company's business activities are concentrated in the Roanoke Valley and surrounding areas. Changes in the local economy, politics, regulations and weather patterns or other factors limiting demand for natural gas could negatively impact the Company's existing customer base, leading to declining usage patterns and financial condition of customers. Furthermore, these changes could also limit the Company's ability to serve its customers or add new customers within its service territory. Any of these factors could adversely affect earnings.\nInability to complete necessary or desirable pipeline expansion or infrastructure improvement projects.\nIn order to serve new customers or expand service to existing customers, the Company needs to install new pipeline and maintain, expand or upgrade its existing distribution, transmission and/or storage infrastructure. Various factors may prevent or delay the completion of such projects or make them more costly, such as the inability to obtain required approval from local, state and/or federal regulatory and governmental bodies, public opposition to the projects, inability to obtain adequate financing, competition for labor and materials, construction delays, cost overruns, and an inability to negotiate acceptable agreements relating to rights-of-way, construction or other material development components. As a result, the Company may not be able to adequately serve existing customers or expand its distribution system to support customer growth. This could include any potential customer growth or system reliability enhancement resulting from connection to the MVP. Any of these factors could negatively impact earnings.\nImpact of weather conditions and related regulatory mechanisms.\nThe Company\u2019s revenues and earnings are dependent upon weather conditions. The Company\u2019s rate structure currently has a WNA factor that results in either a recovery or refund of revenues due to any variation from the 30-year average for heating degree-days. If the provision for the WNA were removed from its rate structure, the Company would be exposed to a much greater risk related to weather variability resulting in earnings volatility. A colder than normal winter could cause the Company to incur higher than normal operating and maintenance costs without the additional revenues to offset the increased costs, as well as higher bad debt expenses, particularly in the context of the\ncurrent pandemic-related restrictions.\nCompetition from other energy providers.\nThe Company competes with other energy providers in its service territory, including those that provide electricity, propane, coal, fuel oil, wind and solar. Price is a significant competitive factor. Higher natural gas costs or decreases in the price of other energy sources may enhance competition and encourage customers to switch to alternative energy sources, thus lowering natural gas deliveries and earnings. Price considerations could also inhibit customer and revenue growth if builders and developers do not perceive natural gas to be a better value than other energy options and elect to install heating systems that use an energy source other than natural gas.\nInability to renew or obtain new franchise agreements or certificates of public convenience.\nRoanoke Gas Company holds either franchises or CPCNs to provide natural gas to customers in its service territory. The franchises are granted by the local municipalities and the CPCNs are granted by the SCC. The ability to renew such agreements is important to the long-term operations of the Company and the ability to obtain new franchises or CPCNs is fundamental to expanding the Company\u2019s service territory. Failure to renew these agreements could result in significant impact to future earnings and the inability to obtain new franchises or CPCNs for new service areas could negatively impact future earnings growth.\nREGULATORY RISKS\nEnvironmental laws or regulations associated with global warming and climate change.\nSeveral federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives have been proposed in recent years in an attempt to limit the effects of global warming and climate change, including greenhouse gas emissions such as those created by the combustion of fossil fuels such as natural gas. Passage of new environmental legislation or implementation of regulations that mandate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions or other similar restrictions could have a negative effect on the Company\u2019s core operations and its investment in the LLC. Such legislation could impose limitations on greenhouse gas emissions, require funding of new energy efficiency objectives, impose new operational requirements or lead to other additional costs to the Company. Regulations restricting or prohibiting the use of coal as a fuel for electric power generation has increased the demand for natural gas, and could at some point potentially result in natural gas supply concerns and higher costs for natural gas. Legislation or regulations could limit the exploration and development of natural gas reserves, making the price of natural gas less competitive and less attractive as a fuel source for consumers. Future legislation could also place limitations on the amount of natural gas used by businesses and homeowners to reduce the level of emissions, resulting in reduced deliveries and earnings.\nIncreased compliance and pipeline safety requirements and fines.\nThe Company is committed to the safe and reliable delivery of natural gas to its customers. Working in concert with this commitment are numerous federal and state laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in the levy of significant fines. There are inherent risks that may be beyond the Company\u2019s control, including third party actions, which could result in damage to pipeline facilities, injury and even death. Such incidents could subject the Company to lawsuits, large fines, increased scrutiny and loss of customers, all of which could have a significant effect on the Company\u2019s financial position and results of operations.\nRegulatory actions or failure to obtain timely rate relief.\nThe Company\u2019s natural gas distribution operations are regulated by the SCC. The SCC approves the rates that the Company charges its customers. If the SCC did not authorize rates that provided for the timely recovery of costs or a reasonable rate of return on investment in natural gas distribution facilities, earnings could be negatively impacted. Issuance of debt and equity by Roanoke Gas is also subject to SCC regulation and approval. Delays or lack of approvals could inhibit the ability to access capital markets and negatively impact liquidity or earnings.\nCompliance with and changes in tax laws.\nThe Company is subject to extensive tax laws and regulations. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted that could result in increased tax expenditures in the future.\nMany of these tax liabilities are subject to audits by the respective taxing authority. These audits may result in additional taxes as well as interest and penalties.\nFINANCIAL RISKS\nInvestment in Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC.\nThe success of the Company's investment in the LLC is predicated on several key factors including but not limited to the ability of all investors to meet their capital calls when due, timely state and federal approvals and completing the construction of the pipeline. Any significant delay, cost over-run or the failure to receive the requisite approvals on a timely basis, or at all, could have a significant effect on the Company's earnings and financial position.\nAlthough the LLC initially received the necessary federal and state permits to construct the pipeline, progress on the MVP has been hindered by several legal and regulatory obstacles as the Fourth Circuit, FERC and other governmental agencies have issued stays, stop orders or delayed authorizations affecting portions or all of the project pending resolution of issues or concerns raised as the project has progressed. The LLC is currently waiting on resolution of the Fourth Circuit's stay of the Nationwide Permit 12 imposed in October 2020 preventing the pipeline from crossing streams and wetlands. FERC has not yet granted a revised authorization to complete construction work in a 25 mile section of the pipeline route. The LLC also needs authorizations from the Bureau of Land Management and the United States Forest Service and resolution of challenges to the Biological Opinion and Incidental Take Statement issued by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\nSeveral of the prior issues have been resolved; however, the ongoing obstacles as discussed above continue to cause delays in construction and have resulted in significantly higher projected costs and an extended targeted in-service date for the pipeline. These cost overruns may not be approved for recovery or be recovered through other regulatory mechanisms, and the LLC could be obligated to make delay or termination payments or be responsible for other contractual damages. The LLC could also experience the loss of tax incentives, or delayed or diminished returns, and could be required to write-off all or a portion of its investment in the project. New or extended regulatory, legislative or judicial actions or challenges could lead to additional delays and even higher costs, which could affect future returns for the LLC and materially impact Resources consolidated financial position and results of operation.\nIn addition, there are numerous risks facing the LLC, which can adversely affect the Company's earnings and financial performance through its investment. The LLC's ability to retain contract crews to complete construction of the pipeline, the inability to obtain or renew ancillary licenses, rights-of-way, permits or other approvals and opposition from pipeline opponents and environmental groups could all influence the successful completion of the pipeline. Should the LLC be unable to adequately address these issues, the LLC\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected, which could materially impact the financial condition and results of operations of the Company. Any failure to negotiate successful project development agreements for new facilities with third parties could have similar results.\nOnce in operation, the LLC\u2019s gas infrastructure facilities are subject to many operational risks. Operational risks could result in, among other things, lost revenues due to prolonged outages, increased expenses due to monetary penalties or fines for compliance failures, liability to third parties for property and personal injury damage, a failure to perform under applicable sales agreements and associated loss of revenues from terminated agreements or liability for liquidated damages under continuing agreements. The consequences of these risks could have a material adverse effect on the LLC\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Uncertainties and risks inherent in operating and maintaining the LLC's facilities include, but are not limited to, risks associated with facility start-up operations, such as whether the facility will achieve projected operating performance on schedule and otherwise as planned. The LLC\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects can be materially adversely affected by weather conditions, including, but not limited to, the impact of severe weather. Threats of terrorism and catastrophic events resulting from terrorism, cyber-attacks, or individuals and/or groups attempting to disrupt the LLC\u2019s business, or the businesses of third parties, may materially adversely affect the LLC\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nPandemic Outbreak.\nA pandemic event such as COVID-19 or other similar diseases could cause a significant economic restriction or recession negatively impacting the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Depending on the duration of these impacts, the liquidity of the Company could be strained, reducing the Company\u2019s ability to complete infrastructure investments and its ability to safely and reliably serve its customers.\nImpact from commercial customers: In an effort to reduce the spread of disease, businesses, either on their own or by government mandates, may close or reduce operations to limit contact with the contagion. A reduction in business activity could result in lower natural gas consumption for both production activities as well as space heating, thereby reducing revenues and gross profit. The closing or reduction in operations by businesses, whether temporary or prolonged, could result in a permanent loss of some commercial customers.\nImpact from residential customers: The closing of businesses may result in job layoffs or other reductions in employee numbers and/or working hours, thus reducing or eliminating customers\u2019 ability to pay their utility bills and resulting in increased bad debt expense.\nImpact on suppliers: A pandemic event could reduce the ability of the Company\u2019s suppliers to supply a sufficient level of natural gas limiting our ability to meet customer demands.\nImpact to the Company's employees: Orders by government bodies could result in employees of the Company being required to limit contact with customers or work remotely, thus not allowing them to complete tasks normally requiring a physical presence. Also, if a significant number of employees were to contract the virus or be quarantined, the Company may not be able to complete key or critical tasks, not limited to, but including key financial, reporting, and operational controls.\nImpact from SCC actions: The SCC could issue orders in response to a pandemic event that result in increased regulatory oversight, operational mandates or restrictions on normal business activities. Any such action could result in increased operating costs or other financial or operational burdens that may negatively impact the Company's results of operations or financial position.\nImpact on financing capabilities: A prolonged economic shutdown due to a pandemic could stress the banking system, thereby limiting the Company\u2019s ability to obtain financing on commercially reasonable terms, which could lead to higher interest costs. Furthermore, a distressed equity market could limit the ability to raise capital through the issuance of Resources\u2019 equity instruments due to depressed prices and low trading volumes.\nAccess to capital to maintain liquidity.\nThe Company relies on a variety of capital sources to operate its business and fund capital expenditures, including internally generated cash from operations, short-term borrowings under its line-of-credit, proceeds from the issuance of additional shares of its common stock and other sources. Access to a line-of-credit is essential to provide seasonal funding of natural gas operations and provide capital budget bridge financing. Access to capital markets and other long-term funding sources is important for capital outlays and funding of the LLC investment. The ability of the Company to maintain and renew its line-of-credit and to secure longer-term financing is critical to operations. Adverse market trends, market disruptions or deterioration in the financial condition of the Company could increase the cost of borrowing, restrict the Company's ability to issue additional shares of its common stock or otherwise limit the Company\u2019s ability to secure adequate funding.\nFailure to comply with debt covenant requirements.\nThe Company's long-term debt obligations and bank line-of-credit contain financial covenants. Noncompliance with any of these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate payment on outstanding debt obligations or cause prepayment penalties. In such an event, the Company may not be able to refinance or repay all of its indebtedness, pay dividends or have sufficient liquidity to meet operating and capital expenditure requirements. Any such acceleration would cause a material adverse change in the Company's financial condition.\nPost-retirement benefits and related funding of obligations.\nThe costs of providing defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans are dependent on a number of factors such as the rates of return on plan assets, discount rates used in determining plan liabilities, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plan, future government regulation, changes in life expectancy, and required or voluntary contributions made to the plan. Changes in actuarial assumptions and differences between the assumptions and actual results, as well as a significant decline in the value of investments that fund these plans, if not offset or mitigated by a decline in plan liabilities, could increase the expense of these plans and require significant additional funding. Although the Company has soft-frozen both plans to limit future growth in each plan's liabilities, ongoing funding obligations and expenses could have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operation and cash flows.\nExposure to market risks.\nThe Company is subject to market risks that are beyond the Company\u2019s control, such as commodity price volatility and interest rate risk. The Company is generally isolated from commodity price risk through the PGA mechanism the Company has in place. With respect to interest rate risk, the Company has been operating in a relatively low interest rate environment for both short and long-term interest rates. However, increases in interest rates could adversely affect the Company\u2019s future financial results.\nGENERAL RISKS\nGeneral downturn in the economy or prolonged period of slow economic recovery.\nA weak or poorly performing economy can negatively affect the Company\u2019s profitability. An economic downturn can result in loss of commercial and industrial customers due to plant closings, a loss of residential customers as well as slow or declining growth in new customer additions, all of which would result in reduced sales volumes and lower revenues. An economic downturn could also result in rising unemployment and other factors that could lead to a loss of customers and an increase in customer delinquencies and bad debt expense.\nInsurance coverage may not be sufficient.\nThe Company currently has liability and property insurance to cover a variety of exposures and risks. The insurance policies supporting said coverages are subject to certain limits and deductibles. Insurance coverage for risks against which the Company and its industry peers typically insure may not be offered in the future or such policies may expand exclusions that limit the amount of coverage or remove certain risks completely as insured events. Furthermore, litigation awards continue to increase and the limits of insurance may not keep pace accordingly. The proceeds received from any such insurance may not be paid in a timely manner. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.", "PERMNO": 80294, "SIC": 4924, "TIC": "RGCO"}
