The economy in Florida and throughout the United States could negatively impact demand for our products as it has in the past, and macroeconomic forces such as employment rates and the availability of credit could have an adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.\nNew home construction while improving, remains below average. Also repair and remodeling markets are subject to many economic factors. Accordingly, either market could decline and lower the demand for, and the pricing of, our products, which could adversely affect our results. The window and door industry is subject to the cyclical market pressures of the larger new construction and repair and remodeling markets. In turn, these changes may be affected by adverse changes in economic conditions such as demographic trends, employment levels, interest rates, and consumer confidence. A decline in the economic environment or new home construction could negatively impact our sales and earnings.\nEconomic and credit market conditions impact our ability to collect receivables. Economic and credit conditions can negatively impact our bad debt expense, which can adversely impact our results of operations. If economic and credit conditions deteriorate, our results of operations may be adversely impacted by bad debts.\nWe are subject to fluctuations in the prices of our raw materials. We experience significant fluctuations in the cost of our raw materials, including aluminum extrusion, vinyl extrusion, polyvinyl butyral and glass. A variety of factors over which we have no control, including global demand for aluminum, fluctuations in oil prices, speculation in commodities futures and the creation of new\n- 7 -\nlaminates or other products based on new technologies impact the cost of raw materials which we purchase for the manufacture of our products. While we attempt to minimize our risk from severe price fluctuations by entering into aluminum forward contracts to hedge these fluctuations in the purchase price of aluminum extrusion we use in production, substantial, prolonged upward trends in aluminum prices could significantly increase the cost of the unhedged portions of our aluminum needs and have an adverse impact on our results of operations. We anticipate that these fluctuations will continue in the future. While we have entered into supply agreements with major producers of our primary raw materials that we believe provides us with reliable sources for certain of our raw materials with stable pricing on favorable terms, if one or both parties to the agreements do not satisfy the terms of the agreements, they may be terminated which could result in our inability to obtain certain raw materials on commercially reasonable terms having an adverse impact on our results of operations. While historically we have to some extent been able to pass on significant cost increases to our customers, our results between periods may be negatively impacted by a delay between the cost increases and price increases in our products.\nWe depend on third-party suppliers for our raw materials. Our ability to offer a wide variety of products to our customers depends on receipt of adequate material supplies from manufacturers and other suppliers. Generally, our raw materials and supplies are obtainable from various sources and in sufficient quantities. However, it is possible that our competitors or other suppliers may create laminates or products based on new technologies that are not available to us or are more effective than our products at surviving hurricane-force winds and wind-borne debris or that they may have access to products of a similar quality at lower prices. Although in many instances we have agreements with our suppliers, these agreements are generally terminable by either party on limited notice. Moreover, we do not have long-term contracts with the suppliers of all of our raw materials.\nTransportation costs represent a significant part of our cost structure. A rapid and prolonged increase in fuel prices may significantly increase our costs and have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nThe home building industry and the home repair and remodeling sector are regulated. The homebuilding industry and the home repair and remodeling sector are subject to various local, state, and federal statutes, ordinances, rules, and regulations concerning zoning, building design and safety, construction, and similar matters, including regulations that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that can be built within the boundaries of a particular area. Increased regulatory restrictions could limit demand for new homes and home repair and remodeling products and could negatively affect our sales and results of operations.\nOur operating results are substantially dependent on sales of our branded impact-resistant products. A majority of our net sales are, and are expected to continue to be, derived from the sales of our branded impact-resistant products. Accordingly, our future operating results will depend on the demand for our impact-resistant products by current and future customers, including additions to this product line that are subsequently introduced. If our competitors release new products that are superior to our impact-resistant products in performance or price, or if we fail to update our impact-resistant products with any technological advances that are developed by us or our competitors or introduce new products in a timely manner, demand for our products may decline. A decline in demand for our impact-resistant products as a result of competition, technological change or other factors could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate sales, which would negatively affect results of operations.\nIn 2015, we launched a new line of vinyl impact-resistant and non-impact energy saving windows. In January 2015, we unveiled our new Vinyl WinGuard and EnergyVue line of vinyl windows. Our intent in launching this new line of vinyl products is that it will ultimately replace various existing lines of vinyl impact-resistant and energy saving windows. We designed these products to exceed the most stringent impact-resistance and energy-saving codes in the country, and they have been well received by the industry. However, if these products fail to continue to gain acceptance with our customers as replacements of our currently successful lines of vinyl windows, we could lose market share to our competitors that produce similar products, which could have a material impact on our sales and negatively affect results of operations.\nChanges in building codes could lower the demand for our impact-resistant windows and doors. The market for our impact-resistant windows and doors depends in large part on our ability to satisfy state and local building codes that require protection from wind-borne debris. If the standards in such building codes are raised, we may not be able to meet their requirements, and demand for our products could decline. Conversely, if the standards in such building codes are lowered or are not enforced in certain areas, demand for our impact-resistant products may decrease. Further, if states and regions that are affected by hurricanes but do not currently have such building codes fail to adopt and enforce hurricane protection building codes; our ability to expand our business in such markets may be limited.\nOur industry is competitive, and competition may increase as our markets grow or as more states adopt or enforce building codes that require impact-resistant products. The window and door industry is highly competitive. We face significant competition from numerous small, regional producers, as well as certain national producers. Any of these competitors may (i) foresee the course of market development more accurately than do we, (ii) develop products that are superior to our products, (iii) have the ability to\n- 8 -\nproduce similar products at a lower cost, or (iv) adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements than do we. Additionally, new competitors may enter our industry, and larger existing competitors may increase their efforts and devote substantially more resources to expand their presence in the impact-resistant market. If we are unable to compete effectively, demand for our products may decline. In addition, while we are skilled at creating finished impact-resistant and other window and door products, the materials we use can be purchased by any existing or potential competitor. New competitors can enter our industry, and existing competitors may increase their efforts in the impact-resistant market. Furthermore, if the market for impact-resistant windows and doors continues to expand, larger competitors could enter or expand their presence in the market and may be able to compete more effectively. Finally, we may not be able to maintain our costs at a level for us to compete effectively. If we are unable to compete effectively, demand for our products and our profitability may decline.\nOur business is currently concentrated in one state. Our business is concentrated geographically in Florida. Focusing operations into manufacturing locations in Florida optimizes manufacturing efficiencies and logistics, and we believe that a focused approach to growing our share within our core wind-borne debris markets in Florida, from the Gulf Coast to the mid-Atlantic, and certain international markets, will maximize value and return. However, such a focus further concentrates our business, and another prolonged decline in the economy of the state of Florida or of certain coastal regions, a change in state and local building code requirements for hurricane protection, or any other adverse condition in the state or certain coastal regions, could cause a decline in the demand for our products, which could have an adverse impact on our sales and results of operations.\nWe have incurred additional indebtedness. We have incurred additional indebtedness under our credit facilities as a result of increasing our borrowing levels to fund acquisitions, and to provide for up to $40 million of revolving credit borrowings. We and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future to fund additional acquisitions and/or to borrow under our revolving credit facility to fund working capital needs. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, certain risks which we currently do not consider significant could intensify.\nOur debt instruments contain various covenants that limit our ability to operate our business. Our credit facility contains various provisions that limit our ability to, among other things, transfer or sell assets, including the equity interests of our subsidiaries, or use asset sale proceeds; pay dividends or distributions on our capital stock, make certain restricted payments or investments; create liens to secure debt; enter into transactions with affiliates; merge or consolidate with another company; and engage in unrelated business activities.\nIn addition, under certain circumstances and depending on the degree of borrowing we may elect to incur under the revolving credit portion of our credit facility, our credit facility requires us to maintain a net leverage ratio, as defined in our credit facility, below certain maximums which decrease over time. Our ability to comply with the requirements of this maximum net leverage ratio, as well as other provisions of our credit facility, may be affected by changes in our operating and financial performance, changes in general business and economic conditions, adverse regulatory developments, or other events beyond our control. The breach of this maximum net leverage ratio requirement, could result in a default under our indebtedness, which could cause it and other obligations to become immediately due and payable. If any of our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not be able to repay it.\nWe may be adversely affected by any disruption in our information technology systems. Our operations are dependent upon our information technology systems, which encompass all of our major business functions. A disruption in our information technology systems for any prolonged period could result in delays in receiving inventory and supplies or filling customer orders and adversely affect our customer service and relationships.\nIn order to maintain our leadership position in the market and efficiently process increased business volume, we are making a significant upgrade to our computer hardware, software and our Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) System. The ERP implementation was substantially completed by the end of 2015. Conversion to the new ERP system has caused significant inefficiencies that have adversely affected our results of operations and disrupted our manufacturing processes to varying degrees during the conversion. Additional disruptions due to the completion of the final stages of the conversion could affect our ability to maintain and grow the business, and our operations and financial results could be further adversely impacted.\nWe may be adversely affected by any disruptions to our manufacturing facilities or disruptions to our customer, supplier, or employee base. Any disruption to our facilities resulting from hurricanes and other weather-related events, fire, an act of terrorism, or any other cause could damage a significant portion of our inventory, affect our distribution of products, and materially impair our ability to distribute our products to customers. We could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our customers during the time that it takes for us to reopen or replace a damaged facility. In addition, if there are disruptions to our customer and supplier base or to our employees caused by hurricanes, our business could be temporarily adversely affected by higher costs for materials, increased shipping and storage costs, increased labor costs, increased absentee rates, and scheduling issues. Furthermore, some of our direct and indirect suppliers have unionized work forces, and strikes, work stoppages, or slowdowns experienced by these suppliers could result in slowdowns or closures of their facilities. Any interruption in the production or delivery of our supplies could reduce sales of our products and increase our costs.\n- 9 -\nThe nature of our business exposes us to product liability and warranty claims. We are, from time to time, involved in product liability and product warranty claims relating to the products we manufacture and distribute that, if adversely determined, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, we may be exposed to potential claims arising from the conduct of homebuilders and home remodelers and their sub-contractors. Although we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable and adequate insurance in excess of our self-insured amounts, we may not be able to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms or such insurance may not provide adequate protection against potential liabilities. Product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods, regardless of the ultimate outcome. Claims of this nature could also have a negative impact on customer confidence in our products and our company.\nWe are subject to potential exposure to environmental liabilities and are subject to environmental regulation. We are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental laws, ordinances, and regulations. Although we believe that our facilities are in material compliance with such laws, ordinances, and regulations, as owners and lessees of real property, we can be held liable for the investigation or remediation of contamination on such properties, in some circumstances, without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for such contamination. Remediation may be required in the future as a result of spills or releases of petroleum products or hazardous substances, the discovery of unknown environmental conditions, or more stringent standards regarding existing residual contamination. More burdensome environmental regulatory requirements may increase our general and administrative costs and may increase the risk that we may incur fines or penalties or be held liable for violations of such regulatory requirements.\nWe conduct all of our operations through our subsidiaries, and rely on payments from our subsidiaries to meet all of our obligations. We are a holding company and derive all of our operating income from our subsidiary, PGT Industries, Inc., and its subsidiaries, CGI Windows and Doors, Inc., and beginning on the acquisition date of February 16, 2016, WinDoor, Incorporated. All of our assets are held by our subsidiaries, and we rely on the earnings and cash flows of our subsidiaries to meet our obligations. The ability of our subsidiaries to make payments to us will depend on their respective operating results and may be restricted by, among other things, the laws of their jurisdictions of organization (which may limit the amount of funds available for distributions to us), the terms of existing and future indebtedness and other agreements of our subsidiaries, including our credit facilities, and the covenants of any future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur.\nWe are exposed to risks relating to evaluations of controls required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. We are required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. While we have concluded that at January 2, 2016, we have no material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we cannot assure you that we will not have a material weakness in the future. A \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. If we fail to maintain our internal control over financial reporting that meets the requirements of Section 404, we might be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities such as the SEC or by the NASDAQ Global Market LLC. Additionally, failure to comply with Section 404 or the report by us of a material weakness may cause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements and our stock price may be adversely affected. If we fail to remedy any material weakness, our financial statements may be inaccurate, we may not have access to the capital markets, and our stock price may be adversely affected.\nWe are exposed to risks relating to the continued expansion of our glass operations. We expanded our glass processing capacity with the completion of a new multi-million dollar facility, and are proceeding with the purchase of additional equipment. While the plant expansion continues to progress with no anticipated issues, there is always the potential risk of a delay in completion and of cost over-runs. Should a serious delay of this project take place, or if this project negatively impacted our operational efficiencies, this would impact the cost savings we expect to achieve during 2016 which could negatively affect our future results.\nWe may be adversely impacted by the loss of sales or market share from being unable to keep up with demand. We are currently experiencing growth through higher sales volume and growth in market share. To meet the increased demand, we have been hiring and training new employees for direct and indirect support, and adding to our glass capacity. However, should we be unable to find and retain quality employees to meet demand, or should there be disruptions to the increase in capacity, we may be unable to keep up with our higher sales demand. If our lag time on delivery falls behind, or we are unable to meet customer timing demands, we could lose market share to competitors.\nWe made significant acquisitions late in the third quarter of 2014, and again in February 2016 of companies that sell products similar to PGT\u2019s own impact-resistant line of products in PGT\u2019s primary market of Florida. Late in the third quarter of 2014, we acquired CGI Windows and Doors, Inc. CGI produces the Estate, Sentinel and Targa lines of impact-resistant branded products which are very similar to our WinGuard line of impact-resistant branded products. In February 2016, we acquired WinDoor. WinDoor\n- 10 -\nproduces impact-resistant windows and sliding glass and terrace doors, very similar to PGT and CGI. Nearly all of CGI\u2019s and WinDoor\u2019s sales are in Florida, PGT\u2019s primary market. We believe that adding CGI\u2019s and WinDoor\u2019s branded products and presence in Florida to PGT\u2019s already successful, established line of branded products in Florida will benefit PGT through higher sales and market share. However, no assurances can be given that the combination of these three lines of branded products within a single company will not result in dilution of these brands, resulting in loss of market share and demand for these products.", "PERMNO": 91363, "SIC": 3442, "TIC": "PGTI"}
