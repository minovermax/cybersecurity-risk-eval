{"cik": "1171012", "company": "Uni-Pixel", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-30", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nSet forth below are certain risks and uncertainties relating to our business.\nYou should carefully consider the following information about the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other filings with the SEC. We believe the risks described below are the risks that are material to us as of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business financial condition, operating results and future growth prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected. In these circumstances, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe are a company with a limited operating history, our future profitability is uncertain and we anticipate future losses and negative cash flow, which may limit or delay our ability to become profitable.\nWe are a company with a limited operating history and little revenues to date. We may never be able to produce material revenues or operate on a profitable basis. As a result, we have incurred losses since our inception and expect to experience operating losses and negative cash flow for the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated total deficit of $149.2 million.\nWe anticipate our losses will continue to increase from current levels because we expect to incur additional costs and expenses related to prototype development, consulting costs, laboratory development costs, marketing and other promotional activities, the addition of engineering and manufacturing personnel, and the continued development of relationships with strategic business partners. Moreover, planned products based upon our Performance Engineered Film\u2122 technology may never become commercially viable and thus may never generate any revenues. Even if we find commercially viable applications for our Performance Engineered Film\u2122 technology and materials, we may never recover our research and development expenses.\nNegative press from the SEC investigation and resulting judgment and stockholder litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nThe negative press resulting from the SEC investigation and resulting judgment and stockholder litigation matters may have harmed our reputation and could otherwise result in a loss of future business. It could also adversely affect the public\u2019s perception of us and lead to reluctance by new parties to do business with us. As a result, our business and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nWe are dependent on a limited number of customers.\nWe have only recently begun generating revenues from a limited number of customers, and our customer concentration may change significantly from period-to-period depending on a customer\u2019s product cycle and changes in our industry. The loss of a customer, a reduction in net revenues of a customer for any reason, or a failure of a customer to fulfill its financial or other obligations due to us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and future revenue stream.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control.\nAs a result of our limited operating history and the nature of the markets in which we compete, it is extremely difficult for us to forecast accurately. We base our current and future expense levels largely on our investment plans and estimates of future events, although certain of our expense levels are, to a large extent, fixed. We may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall. Accordingly, any significant shortfall in revenues relative to our planned expenditures would have an immediate adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, we are subject to the following factors, among others, that may negatively affect and cause fluctuations in our operating results:\n\u00b7\nthe timing of programs to our customers;\n\u00b7\nthe announcement or introduction of new products or technologies by our competitors;\n\u00b7\nour ability to upgrade and develop our infrastructure to accommodate growth;\n\u00b7\nour ability to attract and retain key personnel in a timely and cost effective manner;\n\u00b7\ntechnical difficulties;\n\u00b7\nthe amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the expansion of our business, operations, and infrastructure; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic conditions as well as economic conditions specific to the touchscreen industry.\nFurther, as a strategic response to changes in the competitive environment, we may from time to time make certain pricing, service, or marketing decisions that could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Due to the foregoing factors, our revenues and operating results are and will remain difficult to forecast.\nWe are exposed to industry downturns and cyclicality in our target markets than may result in fluctuations in our operating results.\nThe PC and electronics industries have experienced significant economic downturns at various times. These downturns are characterized by diminished product demand, accelerated erosion of average selling prices, and production overcapacity. In addition, the PC and electronics industries are cyclical in nature. We seek to reduce our exposure to industry downturns and cyclicality by providing design and production services for leading companies in rapidly expanding industry segments. We may, however, experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in future operating results because of general industry conditions or events occurring in the general economy.\nIf we do not keep pace with technological innovations, our products may not remain competitive and our revenue and operating results may suffer.\nWe operate in rapidly changing highly competitive markets. Technological advances, the introduction of new products and new design techniques could adversely affect our business unless we are able to adapt to changing conditions. Technological advances could render our solutions less competitive or obsolete, and we may not be able to respond effectively to the technological requirements of evolving markets. Therefore, we will be required to expend substantial funds for and commit significant resources to enhancing and developing new technology which may include purchasing advanced design tools and test equipment, hiring additional highly qualified engineering and other technical personnel, and continuing and expanding research and development activities on existing and potential human interface solutions.\nOur research and development efforts with respect to new technologies may not result in customer or market acceptance. Some or all of those technologies may not successfully make the transition from the research and development stage to cost-effective production as a result of technology problems, competitive cost issues, yield problems, and other factors. Even if we successfully complete a research and development effort with respect to a particular technology, our customers may decide not to introduce or may terminate products utilizing the technology for a variety of reasons, including difficulties with other suppliers of components for the products, superior technologies developed by our competitors and unfavorable comparisons of our solutions with these technologies, price considerations and lack of anticipated or actual market demand for the products.\nOur business could be harmed if we are unable to develop and utilize new technologies that address the needs of our customers, or our competitors or customers develop and utilize new technologies more effectively or more quickly than we can. Any investments made to enhance or develop new technologies that are not successful could have an adverse effect on our net revenue and operating results.\nThe length of a customer\u2019s product development and release cycle depends on many factors outside of our control and could cause us to incur significant expenses without offsetting revenues, or revenues that vary significantly from quarter to quarter.\nThe development and release cycle for customer products is lengthy and unpredictable. OEMS and other customers often undertake significant evaluation and design in the qualification of our products, which contributes to a lengthy product release cycle. A customer\u2019s decision to purchase our technology often requires a lengthy approval process undertaken by several decision makers at the customer. The process requires us to make significant investments of time and resources before we can be sure that we will generate any significant sales to our customers or recover our investment. There is no assurance that a customer will adopt our technology after the evaluation or design phase, and we face the risk that our technology will fail to meet our customer\u2019s technical, performance or cost requirements, or that our products will be replaced by competitive products or alternative technological solutions. Even if our product is satisfactory to our customer, the customer may delay or terminate its product development efforts. The occurrence of any of these events could cause sales to not materialize, be deferred, or be cancelled, which would adversely affect our operating results. Furthermore, the lengthy and variable development and release cycle for products may also have a negative impact on the timing of our revenues, causing our revenues and results of operations to vary significantly from quarter to quarter.\nExpansion into new markets may increase the complexity of our business, cause us to increase our research and development expenses to develop new products and technologies or cause our capital expenditures to increase, and if we are unable to successfully adapt our business processes and product offerings as required by these new markets, our ability to grow will be adversely affected.\nAs we expand our product lines to sell into new markets, such as automotive, the overall complexity of our business may increase at an accelerated rate and we may become subject to different market dynamics. These dynamics may include, among other things, different demand volume, seasonality, product requirements, sales channels, and warranty and return policies. In addition, expansion into other markets may result in increases in research and development expenses and substantial investments in manufacturing capability or technology enhancements. If we fail to successfully expand into new markets with products that we do not currently offer, we may lose business to our competitors or new entrants who offer these products.\nWe have had a history of losses and may require additional capital to fund our operations, which capital may not be available on commercially attractive terms or at all.\nWe have experienced substantial net losses in each fiscal period since our inception. These net losses resulted from a lack of substantial revenues and the significant costs incurred in the development and acceptance of our technology. We may in the future require sources of capital in addition to cash on hand to continue operations and to implement our business plan. We project that we have sufficient liquid assets to continue operating for at least the next twelve months. However, if our operations do not become cash flow positive, we may be forced to seek credit line facilities from financial institutions, equity investments, or debt arrangements. No assurances can be given that we will be successful in obtaining such additional financing on reasonable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be unable to adequately fund our business plan, which could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIf third parties infringe upon our intellectual property, we may expend significant resources enforcing our rights or suffer competitive injury.\nExisting laws, contractual provisions and remedies afford only limited protection for our intellectual property. We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights. Effective policing of the unauthorized use of our technology or intellectual property is difficult and litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights. Intellectual property litigation is not only expensive, but time-consuming, regardless of the merits of any claim, and could divert attention of our management from operating the business. Intellectual property lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties due to, among other things, the complexity of the technical issues involved, and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in asserting our intellectual property rights. Attempts may be made to copy or reverse engineer aspects of our technology or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. We may not be able to detect infringement and may lose competitive position in the market before they do so. In addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies. We cannot assure you that we will be able to protect our proprietary rights against unauthorized third party copying or use. The unauthorized use of our technology or of our proprietary information by competitors could have an adverse effect on our ability to sell our technology.\nThe laws of foreign countries may not provide protection of our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, which may make it more difficult for us to protect our intellectual property.\nAs part of our business strategy, we target customers and relationships with suppliers and original equipment manufacturers in countries with large populations and propensities for adopting new technologies. However, many of these countries do not address misappropriation of intellectual property nor deter others from developing similar, competing technologies or intellectual property. Effective protection of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries. In particular, the laws of some foreign countries in which we do business may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. As a result, we may not be able to effectively prevent competitors in these regions from infringing our intellectual property rights, which could reduce our competitive advantage and ability to compete in those regions and negatively impact our business.\nAny claims that our technologies infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties could result in significant costs and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe cannot be certain that our technologies and products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other third party proprietary rights. Any claims, with or without merit, could result in significant litigation costs and diversion of resources, including the attention of management, and could require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. There can be no assurance that such licenses could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, or that the terms of any offered licenses would be acceptable to us. We may also have to pay substantial damages to third parties, or indemnify customers or licensees for damages they suffer if the products they purchase from us or the technology they license from us violates any third party intellectual property rights. An adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding, or a failure to obtain necessary licenses to use such third-party technology could prevent us from manufacturing, using, or selling certain of our products, and there is no guarantee that we will able to develop or acquire alternate non-infringing technology.\nIn addition, we license certain technology used in and for our products from third parties. These third-party licenses are granted with restrictions, and there can be no assurances that such third-party technology will remain available to us on commercially acceptable terms.\nIf third-party technology currently utilized in our products is no longer available to us on commercially acceptable terms, or if any third party initiates litigation against us for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights, we may not be able to sell certain of our products and we could incur significant costs in defending against litigation or attempting to develop or acquire alternate non-infringing products, which would have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nRisks Related to Owning Our Common Stock\nOur common stock has experienced significant price and volume volatility, which substantially increases the risk of loss to persons owning our common stock.\nOur common stock has traded on The NASDAQ Capital Market as low as $0.48 and as high at $41.42 during the period from December 10, 2010 through December 31, 2015. In addition, the markets for high technology stocks have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of the particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of shares our common stock.\nThe value of an investment in our common stock could decline due to the impact of any of the following factors upon the market price of our common stock:\n\u00b7\nDisappointing results from our development efforts;\n\u00b7\nFailure to meet our revenue or profit goals or operating budget;\n\u00b7\nDecline in demand for our common stock;\n\u00b7\nDownward revisions in securities analysts\u2019 estimates or changes in general market conditions;\n\u00b7\nTechnological innovations by competitors or in competing technologies;\n\u00b7\nInvestor perception of our industry or our prospects;\n\u00b7\nGeneral economic trends;\n\u00b7\nVariations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u00b7\nOur inability to increase revenues:\n\u00b7\nAnnouncement of new customer relationships by our competitors;\n\u00b7\nDepartures of our executive officers;\n\u00b7\nGeneral conditions in the economy, including fluctuations in interest rates;\n\u00b7\nDevelopments in patents or other intellectual property rights and litigation;\n\u00b7\nDevelopments in our relationships with our customers and suppliers;\n\u00b7\nAny significant acts of terrorism against the United States; and\n\u00b7\nOur currently limited public float.\nWe have a significant number of outstanding warrants and options, and future sales of the underlying shares of common stock could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding warrants and options exercisable for an aggregate of 13,011,554 shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $2.33 per share. Upon exercise of these warrants or options, we would issue additional shares of our stock. As a result, our current stockholders as a group would own a substantially smaller interest in us and may have less influence on our management and policies than they now have. Furthermore, the holders may sell these shares in the public markets from time to time, without limitations on the timing, amount or method of sale. As our stock price rises, the holders may exercise more of their warrants and options and sell a large number of shares. This could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nIn addition, warrants covering 9,625,871 shares which were issued in November 2015 have an exercise price of $1.50 per share and have a term of five years from the date of issuance. The exercise price of the warrants and the number of shares for which the warrants are exercisable are subject to certain adjustments if we issue or sell additional shares of common stock or common stock equivalents at a price per share less than the exercise price then in effect, or without consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there will be no adjustment to the exercise price of these warrants or number of warrant shares issuable upon exercise in connection with the issuance of common stock upon Board of Director-approved employee benefit plans or upon the conversion, exercise or payment of certain outstanding, excluded securities.\nWe may be required to raise additional financing by issuing new securities with terms or rights superior to those of our existing stockholders, which could adversely affect the market price of our shares of common stock and our business.\nWe may require additional financing to fund future operations, including expansion in current and new markets, development and acquisition, capital costs and the costs of any necessary implementation of technological innovations or alternative technologies. We may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms, if at all. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, the percentage ownership of our current stockholders will be reduced, and the holders of the new equity securities may have rights superior to those of the holders of shares of common stock, which could adversely affect the market price and the voting power of shares of our common stock. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt securities, the holders of these debt securities would similarly have some rights senior to those of the holders of shares of common stock, and the terms of these debt securities could impose restrictions on operations and create a significant interest expense for us which could have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nOur common stock may be delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market, or NASDAQ.\nAs previously disclosed, on January 8, 2016, we received a deficiency letter from NASDAQ notifying us that, for the prior 30 consecutive business days, the bid price our common stock had closed below the minimum $1.00 per share requirement for continued inclusion on NASDAQ. If the bid price of our common stock stays below $1.00 for an extended period, or we are unable to continue to meet NASDAQ\u2019s listing maintenance standards for any other reason, our common stock could be delisted from NASDAQ. On March 15, 2016, the last reported sale price of our common stock on NASDAQ was $0.73 per share.\nIf our stock is delisted from NASDAQ, we will make every possible effort to have it listed on the Over the Counter Bulletin Board (the \u201cOTC Bulletin Board\u201d). If our common stock was to be traded on the OTC Bulletin Board, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), and related SEC rules would impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that sell our securities. These rules may adversely affect the ability of stockholders to sell our common stock and otherwise negatively affect the liquidity, trading market and price of our common stock.\nIf our common stock would not be able to be traded on the OTC Bulletin Board, we would make every effort to have it available for trading on the National Quotation Bureau\u2019s Pink Sheets, or the Pink Sheets. The Pink Sheets market consists of security firms who act as market makers in the stocks, usually, of very small companies. The bid and asked prices are not quoted electronically, but are quoted daily in \u201chard copy\u201d which is delivered to firms that subscribe. Stocks that trade in the Pink Sheets are usually not as liquid as those that trade in electronic markets and, often time, the difference between the bid and the asked prices are substantial. As a result, if our common stock were traded on the Pink Sheets, there would likely be a further negative effect on the liquidity, trading market and price of our common stock even compared to what we might suffer if we were traded on the OTC Bulletin Board.\nWe believe that the listing of our stock on a recognized national trading market, such as NASDAQ, is an important part of our business and strategy. Such a listing helps our stockholders by providing a readily available trading market with current quotations. Without such a listing, the sale or purchase of our stock would likely be made more difficult and the trading volume and liquidity of our stock would likely decline. Furthermore, a delisting from NASDAQ would result in negative publicity and would negatively impact our ability to raise capital in the future.\nShares eligible for future sale may adversely affect the market.\nFrom time to time, certain of our stockholders may be eligible to sell all or some of their shares of common stock by means of ordinary brokerage transactions in the open market pursuant to Rule 144, promulgated under the Securities Act, subject to certain limitations. In general, pursuant to Rule 144, non-affiliate stockholders may sell freely after six months subject only to the current public information requirement (which disappears after one year). Affiliates may sell after six months subject to the Rule 144 volume, manner of sale (for equity securities), current public information and notice requirements. Of the 32,170,778 shares of our common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2015, approximately 31.9 million shares are held by non- \u201caffiliates\u201d and are, or will be, freely tradable without restriction, and the remaining shares are held by our \u201caffiliates\u201d, as of such date. Any substantial sale of our common stock pursuant to Rule 144 or pursuant to any resale prospectus (including sales by investors of securities acquired in connection with this offering) may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our shares of common stock, and have no plans to do so in the foreseeable future. We intend to retain earnings, if any, to develop and expand our business operations.\nOur charter documents and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover that stockholders consider favorable.\nProvisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and applicable provisions of Delaware law may delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in our control or change in our management, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares, or transactions that our stockholders might otherwise deem to be in their best interests. These provisions:\n\u00b7\nauthorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval and to designate the rights, preferences and privileges of each class; if issued, such preferred stock would increase the number of outstanding shares of our capital stock and could include terms that may deter an acquisition of us;\n\u00b7\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations to the board of directors or for proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings;\n\u00b7\nlimit who may call stockholder meetings;\n\u00b7\ndo not provide for cumulative voting rights; and\n\u00b7\nprovide that all vacancies, including newly created directorships, may, except as otherwise required by law, be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law generally limits our ability to engage in any business combination with certain persons who own 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock or any of our associates or affiliates who at any time in the past three years have owned 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These provisions may have the effect of entrenching our management team and may deprive you of the opportunity to sell your shares to potential acquirers at a premium over prevailing prices. This potential inability to obtain a control premium could reduce the price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 12496, "SIC": 3679, "TIC": "UNXLQ"}
