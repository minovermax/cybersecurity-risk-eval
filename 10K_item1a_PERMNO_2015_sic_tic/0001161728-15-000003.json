Risk Factors.\nMGE Energy and its subsidiaries, including MGE, operate in a market environment that involves significant risks, many of which are beyond their control. The following risk factors may adversely affect their results of operations, cash flows and market price for their publicly traded securities. While MGE Energy and MGE believe they have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting their business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect their performance or financial condition in the future.\nRegulatory Risk\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation in our business, which affects our costs and responsiveness to changing events and circumstances.\nOur business is subject to regulation at the State and Federal levels. We are subject to regulation as a holding company by the PSCW. MGE is regulated by the PSCW as to its rates, terms and conditions of service; various business practices and transactions; financing; and transactions between it and its affiliates, including MGE Energy. MGE is also subject to regulation by the FERC, which regulates certain aspects of its business. The regulations adopted by the State and Federal agencies affect the manner in which we do business, our ability to undertake specified actions since pre-approval or authorization may be required, the costs of operations, and the level of rates charged to recover such costs. Our ability to attract capital is also dependent, in part, upon our ability to obtain a fair return from the PSCW.\nWe could be subject to higher costs and potential penalties resulting from mandatory reliability standards.\nMGE must adhere to mandatory reliability standards for its electric distribution system established by NERC. These standards cover areas such as critical infrastructure protection, emergency preparedness, facility design, and transmission operations, among others. The critical infrastructure protection standards focus on physical and access security of cyber assets, as well as incident response and recovery planning. MGE could be subject to higher operating costs in order to maintain compliance with the mandatory reliability standards, and any noncompliance could result in sanctions including monetary penalties.\nWe face risk for the recovery of fuel and purchased power costs.\nMGE has price risk exposure with respect to the price of natural gas, electricity, coal, emission credits, and oil. MGE burns natural gas in several of its peak electric generation facilities, and in many cases, the cost of purchased power is tied to the cost of natural gas. Under the electric fuel rules, MGE would defer electric fuel-related costs that fall outside a symmetrical cost tolerance band that is currently plus or minus 2% around the amount approved in its most recent rate order. Any over/under recovery of the actual costs is determined on an annual basis and will be adjusted in future billings to its electric retail customers. Under the electric fuel rules, MGE is required to defer the benefit of lower costs, if its actual fuel costs fall outside the lower end of the range, and would defer costs, less any excess revenues, if its actual fuel costs exceeded the upper end of the range. Excess revenues are defined as revenues in the year in question that provide MGE with a greater return on common equity than authorized by the PSCW in MGE's latest rate order. MGE assumes the risks and benefits of variances that are within the cost tolerance band.\nWe are subject to changing environmental laws and regulations that may affect our costs and business plans.\nOur subsidiaries are subject to environmental laws and regulations that affect the manner in which they conduct business, including capital expenditures, operating costs and potential liabilities. Changes and developments in these laws and regulations may alter or limit our business plans, make them more costly, or expose us to liabilities for past or current operations.\nNumerous environmental laws and regulations govern many aspects of our present and future operations, including air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges, solid waste, threatened and endangered species, and hazardous waste. These evolving regulations can introduce uncertainty with respect to capital expenditures and operational planning, and can introduce costly delays if previous decisions need to be revisited as a result of judicial mandate or regulatory change. These regulations generally require us to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental permits and approvals, and can result in increased capital, operating, and other costs and operating restrictions, particularly with regard to enforcement efforts focused on obligations under existing regulations with respect to power plant emissions and compliance costs associated with regulatory requirements. These effects can be seen not only with respect to new construction but could also require the installation of additional control equipment or other compliance measures such as altered operating conditions at existing facilities.\nIn addition, we may be a responsible party for environmental clean-up at current or future sites identified as containing hazardous materials or to which waste was sent that is subsequently determined to be hazardous. It is difficult to predict the costs potentially associated with a site clean-up due to the potential joint and several liability for all potentially responsible parties, the nature of the clean-up required, and the availability of recovery from other potentially responsible parties.\nAdditionally, depending on their form and phase-in provisions, GHG emission restrictions could have the potential for a significant financial impact on MGE, including the cost to purchase allowances or do fuel switching.\nOperating Risk\nWe are affected by weather, which affects customer demand and can affect the operation of our facilities.\nThe demand for electricity and gas is affected by weather. Very warm and very cold temperatures, especially for prolonged periods, can dramatically increase the demand for electricity and gas for cooling and heating, respectively, as opposed to the softening effect of more moderate temperatures. Our electric revenues are sensitive to the summer cooling season and, to a lesser extent, the winter heating season. Similarly, very cold temperatures can dramatically increase the demand for gas for heating. A significant portion of our gas system demand is driven by heating. Extreme summer conditions or storms may stress electric transmission and distribution systems, resulting in increased maintenance costs and limiting the ability to meet peak customer demand.\nWe could be adversely affected by changes in the development, and utilization by our customers, of power generation and storage technology.\nDevelopments in power generation and storage could affect our revenues and the timing of the recovery of our costs. Advancements in power generation technology, including commercial and residential solar generation installations and commercial micro turbine installations, are improving the cost-effectiveness of customer self-supply of electricity. Improvements in energy storage technology, including batteries and fuel cells, could also better position customers to meet their around-the-clock electricity requirements. Such developments could reduce customer purchases of electricity, but may not necessarily reduce our investment and operating requirements due to our obligation to serve customers, including those self-supply customers whose equipment has failed for any reason to provide the power they need. In addition, since a portion of our costs are recovered through charges based upon the volume of power delivered, reductions in electricity deliveries will affect the timing of our recovery of those costs and may require changes to our rate structures.\nWe are affected by economic activity within our service area.\nHigher levels of development and business activity generally increase the numbers of customers and their use of electricity and gas. Likewise, periods of recessionary economic conditions generally adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur ability to obtain an adequate supply of coal could limit our ability to operate our coal-fired facilities.\nThe availability of coal and the means to transport coal could:\n\u00b7\nAffect our operating costs due to increased costs associated with lower levels of generation or the need for alternate supply or alternate transportation,\n\u00b7\nLimit our ability to generate electricity if we are unable to arrange adequate deliveries of coal, and\n\u00b7\nResult in potentially higher costs for replacement purchased power as well as potential lost market sales opportunities.\nA significant portion of our electric generating capacity is dependent on coal. Increased oil exploration and production in the United States has increased the amount of oil being transported by railroad, which has affected the availability and scheduling of trains to transport coal. Demand for coal has also been impacted by prevailing prices for natural gas and may affect mine performance. Consequently, we are exposed to the risk that counterparties to these contracts will not be able to fulfill their obligations. Disruption in the delivery of fuel, including disruptions as a result of transportation delays, weather, labor relations, force majeure events, or environmental regulations affecting any of these fuel suppliers, could limit our ability to generate electricity at our facilities at the desired level. Should counterparties fail to perform, or other unplanned disruptions occur, we may be forced to replace the underlying commitment at higher\nprices, or we may be forced to reduce generation at our coal units and replace this lost generation through additional power purchases from third parties. These factors may also affect the terms under which any of our existing coal supply or transportation agreements are renewed or replaced upon the expiration of their current terms.\nOur ability to manage our purchased power costs is influenced by a number of uncontrollable factors.\nWe are exposed to additional purchased power costs to the extent that our power needs cannot be fully covered by the supplies available from our existing facilities and contractual arrangements. Those needs, and our costs, could be affected by:\n\u00b7\nIncreased demand due to, for example, abnormal weather, customer growth, or customer obligations,\n\u00b7\nThe inability to transmit our contracted power from its generation source to our customers due to transmission line constraints, outages, or equipment failures,\n\u00b7\nReductions in the availability of power from our owned or contracted generation sources due to equipment failures, shortages of fuel or environmental limitations on operations, and\n\u00b7\nFailure to perform on the part of any party from which we purchase capacity or energy, whether due to equipment failures or other causes.\nAn unexpected change in demand or the availability of generation or transmission facilities can expose us to increased costs of sourcing electricity in the short-term market where pricing may be more volatile.\nThe equipment and facilities in our operational system are subject to risks which may adversely affect our financial performance.\nWeather conditions, accidents, and catastrophic events, including terrorism and acts of sabotage or war, can result in damage or failures of equipment or facilities and disrupt or limit our ability to generate, transmit, transport, purchase, or distribute electricity and gas. Efforts to repair or replace equipment and facilities may take prolonged periods or may be unsuccessful, or we may be unable to make the necessary improvements to our operational system, causing service interruptions. The resulting interruption of services would result in lost revenues and additional costs. We are also exposed to the risk of accidents or other incidents that could result in damage to or destruction of our facilities or damage to persons or property. Such issues could adversely affect revenues or increase costs to repair and maintain our systems.\nWe rely on the performance of our information technology systems, the failure of which could have an adverse effect on our business and performance.\nWe operate in a highly engineered industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure to manage our finances, to operate our control facilities, to provide electric and gas service to our customers, and to enable compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. Our computer-based systems are vulnerable to interruption or failure due to the age of certain systems, the introduction of viruses, malware, security breaches, fire, power loss, system malfunction, network outages and other events, which may be beyond our control. System interruptions or failures, whether isolated or more widespread, could impact our ability to provide service to our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance.\nOur operations and confidential information are subject to the risk of cyber-attacks.\nOur operations rely on sophisticated information technology systems and networks. Cyber-attacks targeting our electronic control systems used at our generating facilities and for electric and gas distribution systems, could result in a full or partial disruption of our operations. Any disruption of these operations could result in a loss of service to customers and loss of revenue, as well as significant expense to repair system damage and remedy security breaches.\nOur business requires the collection and retention of personally identifiable information of our customers, shareholders, and employees, who expect that we will adequately protect such information. A significant theft, loss, or fraudulent use of personally identifiable information may cause our business reputation to be adversely impacted and could lead to potentially large costs to notify and protect the impacted persons. The occurrence of such an event may cause us to become subject to legal claims, fines, or penalties, any of which could adversely impact our results of operations.\nThe safeguards we have may not always be effective due to the evolving nature of cyber-attacks. We cannot guarantee that such protections will be completely successful in the event of a cyber-attack. If the technology systems were to fail or be breached by a cyber-attack, and not be recovered in a timely fashion, we may be unable to fulfill critical business functions and confidential data could be compromised, adversely impacting our financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could affect our operations.\nEvents such as an aging workforce and retirement of key employees without appropriate replacements may lead to operating challenges and increased costs. Some of the challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge, and length of time period associated with skill development. Failure to identify qualified replacement employees could result in decreased productivity and increased safety costs. If we are unable to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, our operations could be negatively affected.\nFinancial Risk\nWe are exposed to commodity price risk relating to our purchases of natural gas, electricity, coal and oil.\nWe face commodity price risk exposure with respect to our purchases of natural gas, electricity, coal and oil, SO2 allowances and risk through our use of derivatives, such as futures, forwards and swaps, to manage that commodity price risk. We could experience increased costs as a result of volatility in the market values of those commodities. We could also experience losses on our derivative contracts as a result of that market value volatility or if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract. In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these derivative contracts involves our exercise of judgment and use of estimates. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts.\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk.\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk on our variable rate financing. MGE Energy and MGE had $7.0 million of variable-rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2014. Borrowing levels under commercial paper arrangements vary from period to period depending upon capital investments and other factors. Such interest rate risk means that we are exposed to increased financing costs and associated cash payments as a result of changes in the short-term interest rates.\nInterest rate movements and market performance affects our employee benefit plan costs.\nPrevailing interest rates affect our assessment and determination of discount rates that are a key assumption in the determination of the costs and funding of our defined benefit pension plans and may impact the amount of expense and timing of contributions to those plans. The performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy the future obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans. We have significant obligations in these areas and hold significant assets in these trusts. A decline in the market value of those assets may increase our current and longer-term funding requirements for these obligations. Changes in the value of trust fund assets may affect the level of required contributions to these trusts to meet benefit obligations. Reduced benefit plan assets could result in increased benefit costs in future years and may increase the amount and accelerate the timing of required future funding contributions.\nWe are exposed to credit risk primarily through our regulated energy business.\nCredit risk is the loss that may result from counterparty nonperformance. We face credit risk primarily through MGE's regulated energy business. Failure of contractual counterparties to perform their obligations under purchase power agreements, commodity supply arrangements or other agreements may result in increased expenses for MGE as a result of being forced to cover the shortfall in the spot or short-term market, where prices may be more volatile.\nAs a holding company, we are dependent on upstream cash flows from our subsidiaries for the payment of dividends on our common stock.\nAs a holding company, we have no operations of our own, and our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is dependent on the earnings and cash flows of our operating subsidiaries and their ability to pay upstream dividends or to repay funds to us. Prior to funding us, our subsidiaries have financial obligations that must be satisfied, including among others, debt service and obligations to trade creditors, and are subject to contractual and regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends.\nDisruptions in the financial markets or changes to our credit ratings may affect our ability to finance at a reasonable cost and in accordance with our planned schedule.\nThe credit markets have experienced disruption and uncertainty in recent years. To the extent that such issues affect the ability or willingness of credit providers or investors to participate in the credit markets or particular types of investments, or affect their perception of the risk associated with particular types of investments, our cost of borrowing could be affected. We also rely on our strong credit ratings to access the credit markets. If our credit ratings are downgraded for any reason, borrowing costs could increase, potential investors could decrease, or we could be required to provide additional credit assurance, including cash collateral, to contract counterparties.\nGeneral economic conditions may affect our operating revenues and our counterparty risks.\nOperational\nMGE Energy's and MGE's operations are affected by local, national and worldwide economic conditions. The consequences of a prolonged period of reduced economic activity may include lower demand for energy, uncertainty regarding energy prices and the capital and commodity markets, and increased credit risk. A decline in energy consumption may adversely affect our revenues and future growth. Increased credit risk reflects the risk that our retail customers will not pay their bills in a timely manner or at all, which may lead to a reduction in liquidity and an eventual increase in bad debt expense.\nCounterparty creditworthiness\nCredit risk also includes the risk that trading counterparties that owe us money or product will breach their obligations. MGE's risk management policy is to limit transactions to a group of high quality counterparties. Should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, we may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements. In that event, our financial results could be adversely affected and we could incur losses.", "PERMNO": 50789, "SIC": 4931, "TIC": "MGEE"}
