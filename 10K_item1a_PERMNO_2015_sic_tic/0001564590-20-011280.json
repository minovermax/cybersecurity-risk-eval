These risks may negatively impact our existing business, future business opportunities, our financial condition or our financial results. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could also decline. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently see as immaterial, may also negatively impact our business.\nA loss of one or more of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our product sales.\nFor a majority of our sales, we are dependent upon a small number of major retail customers, including Walmart and Ulta. The easy access of consumers to our products is dependent upon these major retail stores and other retail stores carrying our products. The willingness of retail customers to carry any of our products depends on various factors, including the level of sales of the product at their stores. In addition, private label products sold by retail trade chains, which are typically sold at lower prices than branded products, are a source of competition for certain of our product lines.\nAny declines in sales of our products to consumers could result in the loss of retail customers and a corresponding decrease in the distribution of the products, as well as increased costs related to any markdown or return of our products. It is uncertain whether the consumer base served by these stores would purchase our products at other retail stores.\nA significant part of our sales of personal care products are represented by the 7th Heaven sachet products and Batiste Dry Shampoo products, both of which depend upon the continuation of our distributorship agreements with the manufacturers of these products.\nIf our distribution agreements were terminated with Montagne Jeunesse or Church & Dwight, we would no longer be able to distribute 7th Heaven products for Montagne Jeunesse or Batiste Dry Shampoo products for Church & Dwight and sales in our personal care segment would be adversely affected. Sales of our distributed products represent a significant portion of our consolidated net sales, and the loss of those products could affect our relationships with customers who purchase those products from us.\nOn August 1, 2019, we renewed our distribution agreement with Church & Dwight for one year from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020. We have been a distributor for Church & Dwight since 2009 and have renewed our distribution agreement four times. The current term of our Montagne Jeunesse distribution agreement renewed for a two-year term on September 15, 2019.\nOur international operations in China expose us to a number of risks.\nWe have limited experience with distribution in China. There is both cost and risk associated with establishing, developing, and maintaining international sales operations, and promoting our brand internationally. The PRC\u2019s economic, political, and social conditions, and its government policies, could adversely affect our business. We may be exposed to liabilities under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and any determination that we violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur international operations also subject us to changes in trade policies and agreements and other foreign or domestic legal and regulatory requirements, including those resulting in potentially adverse tax consequences or the imposition of onerous trade restrictions such as tariffs, sanctions, and price controls. Any changes in these international trade policies could adversely affect our profitability and stock price.\nA continued change in the consumer product retail market cause our sales to decline.\nOur performance depends upon the general health of the economy and of the retail environment in particular. Consumer products, such as those marketed by us, are increasingly being sold by club stores, dollar stores, mass merchandisers, e-commerce retailers and subscription services. The retail environment is changing with the growth of alternative retail channels and this could significantly change the way traditional retailers do business. If these alternative retail channels were to take significant market share away from traditional retailers or we are not successful in these alternative retail channels, our margins and results of operations may be negatively impacted.\nIn both personal care and household products, our competitors include some of the largest consumer products companies in the United States.\nThe markets in which our products compete are intensely competitive, and many of the other competitors in these markets are larger multi-national consumer products companies. These competitors have much greater financial, technical, and other resources\nthan us, and as a result, are able to regularly introduce new products and spend considerably more on advertising. The distribution and sales of our products can be adversely impacted by the actions of our competitors, and we may have little or no ability to take action to prevent or mitigate these adverse impacts.\nWe have limited resources to promote our products with advertising and marketing effectiveness.\nWe believe the growth of our net sales is dependent upon our ability to introduce our products to current and new consumers through advertising and marketing. At present, we have limited resources compared to many of our competitors to spend on advertising and marketing our products. Advertising and marketing can be important in reaching consumers, although the effectiveness of any particular advertisement and marketing cannot be predicted. Additionally, we may not be able to obtain optimal effectiveness at our current advertising and marketing budget. Our limited resources to promote our products through advertising and marketing may adversely affect our net sales and operating results.\nUnfavorable and uncertain economic conditions could adversely affect our profitability.\nUnfavorable and uncertain economic conditions in the past have adversely affected, and in the future may adversely affect, consumer demand for some of our products, resulting in reduced sales volume and a decrease in our overall profitability. Factors that can affect consumer demand for our products include rates of unemployment, consumer confidence, health care costs, fuel and other energy costs and other economic factors affecting consumer spending behavior.\nOur products are subject to trucking costs, both in delivery to us at our production facility as well as transportation to our customers. As a result, we are exposed to volatility in the freight industry that could affect our costs, including changes in regulations and labor costs. Any increases in transportation costs could adversely affect our profitability if we are not able to pass those costs on to our customers.\nSales of our existing products are affected by changing consumer preferences.\nOur primary market is retail stores in the United States which sell to consumers or end users in the mass market. Consumer preferences can change rapidly and are affected by new competitive products. This situation is true for both personal care and household products. Any changes in consumer preferences can materially affect the sales of our products and the results of our operations.\nOur future performance and growth is dependent, in part, on the introduction of new or acquired products that are successful in the marketplace.\nOur future performance and growth is partially dependent on our ability to successfully identify, develop and introduce new products and product line extensions. The successful development and introduction of new products involves substantial research, development, marketing and promotional expenditures, which we may be unable to recover if the new products do not gain widespread market acceptance.\nWe have pursued and may continue to pursue acquisitions of brands or businesses. Acquisitions involve numerous potential risks, including, among other things, the successful integration of the acquired products or brands and realization of the full extent of expected benefits or synergies. Acquisitions could also result in additional debt, exposure to liabilities, the potential impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, or transaction costs. Any of these risks, should they materialize, could adversely impact our operating results.\nWe face the risk that raw materials for our products may not be available or that costs for these materials will increase.\nWe obtain our raw materials from third party suppliers, some of which are sole source suppliers. We have no long-term contracts with our suppliers and are subject to cost increases. We may not have sufficient raw materials for production if there is a shortage in raw materials or one of our suppliers terminates our relationship. In addition, changing suppliers could involve delays that restrict our ability to manufacture or buy products in a timely manner to meet delivery requirements of our customers. Our suppliers can also be subject to the same risk with their vendors.\nChanges in the regulation of our products, including environmental regulations, could have an adverse effect on the distribution, cost or function of our products.\nRegulations affecting our products include requirements of the FDA and NMPA for cosmetic products and environmental regulations. In the past, the FDA has mentioned the treatment of products with AHAs as drugs, which could make our production and sale of certain Alpha\u00ae Skin Care products more expensive or prohibitive. Also, in the past, we have been required to change the formulation of our household products to comply with environmental regulations and may be required to do so again in the future if the applicable regulations are further amended. Most recently, in 2019, we were impacted by regulatory changes imposed on OTC products by the PRC\u2019s NMPA, which negatively impacted our sales during the year.\nLabeling practices in our industry have recently experienced an increase of warning letters admonishing cosmetics manufacturers for promotional claims on their websites and product labels deemed by the FDA to blur the line between \u201ccosmetics\u201d and \u201cdrugs.\u201d The increase of warning letters by the FDA has also triggered a wave of follow-on class action lawsuits against cosmetic manufacturers in general, including manufacturers not singled out via FDA warning letters. Any claims levied against us could have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nAny adverse developments in litigation could have a material impact on us.\nWe are subject to lawsuits from time to time in the ordinary course of business. While we expect those lawsuits not to have a material effect on us, an adverse development in any such lawsuit or the insurance coverage for a lawsuit could materially and adversely affect our operating results.\nAny loss of our key executives or other personnel could harm our business.\nOur success has depended on the experience and continued service of our executive officers and key employees. If we fail to retain these officers or key employees, our ability to continue our business and effectively compete may be substantially diminished.\nOur stock price can be volatile and can decline substantially.\nOur stock is traded on the OTC Bulletin Board. The volume of trades in our stock varies from day to day but is relatively limited. As a result, any events can result in volatile movements in the price of our stock and can result in significant declines in the market price of our stock.\nWe rely on trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws, which may not be sufficient to protect our intellectual property.\nWe rely on a combination of laws, such as copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality provisions and limited licenses, to establish and protect our intellectual property. We have registered U.S. and foreign country trademarks, and HK NFS has contractually agreed to undertake steps to prevent counterfeiting of our products and to otherwise protect our trademarks in the PRC. These forms of intellectual property protection are critically important to our ability to establish and maintain our competitive position. However, it is possible that laws, contractual restrictions, and other efforts may not be sufficient to prevent misappropriation of our property or to deter others from developing similar intellectual property.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers, and business partners on our networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen, resulting in legal claims or proceedings, which could disrupt our operations and damage our reputation, adversely affect our operating results and stock price.\nWe may from time to time expand our business through acquisitions, which could disrupt our business.\nWe have completed, and may pursue in the future, acquisitions of businesses or assets that are complementary to our business. Such acquisitions involve a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nfailure of the acquired businesses to achieve the results we expect;\n\u2022\nsubstantial cash expenditures;\n\u2022\ndiversion of capital and management attention from operational matters;\n\u2022\nour inability to retain key personnel of the acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nincurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities; and\n\u2022\nthe potential disruption and strain on our existing business and resources that could result from our planned growth and continuing integration of our acquisitions.\nIf we fail to properly evaluate acquisitions, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, we may incur costs in excess of what is anticipated, and management resources and attention may be diverted from other necessary or valuable activities. Any acquisition may not result in short-term or long-term benefits to us. If we are unable to integrate or successfully manage any business that we acquire, we may not realize anticipated cost savings, improved efficiencies or revenue growth, which may result in reduced profitability or operating losses.\nManufacturing relationships with third parties.\nWe currently outsource certain of our manufacturing to one or more third parties, which we intend to expand. Failure by one or more of these third parties to complete activities on schedule or in accordance with our expectations, meet their contractual or other obligations to us, or comply with applicable laws or regulations, or any disruption in the relationships between us and one or more of these third parties, could delay or prevent the development, approval, manufacturing, or commercialization of our products, could expose us to suboptimal quality of service delivery or deliverables, could result in repercussions such as missed deadlines or other timeliness issues, erroneous data and supply disruptions, and could also result in non-compliance with legal or regulatory requirements or industry standards or reputational harm, all with potential negative implications for our product pipeline and business.\nOur sales in China may be materially adversely impacted due to the coronavirus 2019 (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) outbreak.\nOur business could be adversely affected by the effects of a widespread outbreak of contagious disease, including the recent outbreak of respiratory illness caused by COVID-19, first identified in Wuhan, China. We have operations in China related to the sale of our products. In an effort to halt the outbreak of COVID-19, the Chinese government has placed significant restrictions on travel within China, leading to extended business closures. These travel restrictions and business closures could adversely impact our operations in China, including our ability to sell or distribute our products, as well as cause temporary closures of the facilities of our distributors or customers. Any disruption of our distributors or customers could impact our global sales and operating results. We cannot at this time accurately predict what effects these conditions will have on our operations, including due to uncertainties relating to the ultimate geographic spread of the virus, the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, and the length of the travel restrictions and business closures imposed by the Chinese government and governments of other impacted countries. In addition, a significant outbreak of contagious diseases in the human population could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our products and impact our operating results.", "PERMNO": 69471, "SIC": 2844, "TIC": "SLGD"}
