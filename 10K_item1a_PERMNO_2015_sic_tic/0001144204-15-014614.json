Risk Factors\nIn addition to the discussion and analysis set forth in \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d and the cautionary statements set forth in \u201cItem 1. Business,\u201d the following risk factors should be considered when evaluating the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, and outlook. These risk factors should also be considered when evaluating any investment decision with respect to the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s Actual Loan Losses May Exceed its Allowance for Loan Losses, Which Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company\u2019s Results of Operations\nThe Company has policies and procedures in place to manage its exposure to risk related to its lending operations. However, despite these practices, the Company\u2019s loan customers may not repay their loans according to the terms of the loans and the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance. Economic weakness, including high unemployment rates and lower values for the collateral underlying loans, may affect borrowers\u2019 ability or willingness to repay their loan obligations that could lead to increased loan losses or provisions. As a result, the Company may experience significant loan losses, including losses that may exceed the amounts established in the allowance for loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on its operating results and capital.\nDeclines in Real Estate Values Could Adversely Affect Collateral Values and the Company\u2019s Results of Operations\nFrom time-to-time the Company\u2019s market areas have experienced lower real estate values, higher levels of residential and non-residential tenant vacancies, and weakness in the market for sale of new or existing properties, for both commercial and residential real estate. Such developments could negatively affect the value of the collateral securing the Company\u2019s mortgage and related loans and could in turn lead to increased losses on loans and foreclosed real estate. Increased losses would affect the Company\u2019s loan loss allowance and may cause it to increase its provision for loan losses resulting in a charge to earnings and capital.\nA Significant Portion of the Company\u2019s Lending Activities Are Focused on Commercial Lending\nThe Company has identified multi-family, commercial real estate, commercial and industrial, and construction loans as areas for lending emphasis. In addition, the Company has employed the appropriate management, sales, and administrative personnel, as well as installed appropriate systems and procedures, to support this lending emphasis. However, these types of loans have historically carried greater risk of payment default than loans to retail borrowers. As the volume of commercial lending increases, credit risk increases. In the event of increased defaults from commercial borrowers, the Company\u2019s provision for loan losses would further increase and loans may be written off and, therefore, earnings would be reduced. In addition, costs associated with the administration of problem loans increase and, therefore, earnings would be further reduced.\nFurther, as the portion of the Company's loans secured by the assets of commercial enterprises increases, the Company becomes increasingly exposed to environmental liabilities and related compliance burdens. Even though the Company is also subject to environmental requirements in connection with residential real estate lending, the possibility of liability increases in connection with commercial lending, particularly in industries that use hazardous materials and/or generate waste or pollution or that own property that was the subject of prior contamination. If the Company does not adequately assess potential environmental risks, the value of the collateral it holds may be less than it expects; further, regulations expose the Bank to potential liability for remediation and other environmental compliance.\nRegulators Continue to be Strict, which may Affect the Company's Business and Results of Operations\nIn addition to the effect of new laws and regulations, the regulatory climate in the U.S., particularly for financial institutions, continues to be strict. As a consequence, regulatory activity affecting financial institutions relating to a wide variety of safety and soundness and compliance issues continues to be elevated. Such regulatory activity, if directed at the Company or the Bank, could have an adverse effect on the Company's or the Bank's costs of compliance and results of operations.\nThe Bank\u2019s Ability to Pay Dividends to the Company Is Subject to Limitations that May Affect the Company\u2019s Ability to Pay Dividends to its Shareholders and/or Repurchase Its Stock\nThe Company is a separate legal entity from the Bank and engages in no substantial activities other than its ownership of the common stock of the Bank. Consequently, the Company\u2019s net income and cash flows are derived primarily from the Bank\u2019s operations and capital distributions. The availability of dividends from the Bank to the Company is limited by various statutes and regulations, including those of the OCC and FRB. In addition, new requirements imposed by Basel III could limit the capital distributions of the Bank. As a result, it is possible, depending on the results of operations and the financial condition of the Bank and other factors, that the OCC and/or the FRB could restrict the payment by the Bank of dividends or other capital distributions or take other actions which could negatively affect the Bank's results and dividend capacity. The federal regulators continue to be stringent in their interpretation, application and enforcement of banks' capital requirements, which could affect the regulators\u2019 willingness to allow Bank dividends to the Company. If the Bank is required to reduce its dividends to the Company, or is unable to pay dividends at all, or the FRB separately does not allow the Company to pay dividends, the Company may not be able to pay dividends to its shareholders at existing levels or at all and/or may not be able to repurchase its common stock.\nGlobal Credit Market Volatility and Weak Economic Conditions May Significantly Affect the Company\u2019s Liquidity, Financial Condition, and Results of Operations\nGlobal financial markets continue to be unstable and unpredictable, and economic performance has been inconsistent in various countries. Developments relating to the federal budget, federal borrowing authority, and/or other political issues could also negatively impact these markets, as could global developments such as a foreign sovereign debt crisis. Volatility and/or instability in global financial markets could also affect the Company\u2019s ability to sell investment securities and other financial assets, which in turn could adversely affect the Company\u2019s liquidity and financial position. These factors could also affect the prices at which the Company could make any such sales, which could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition. Conditions could also negatively affect the Company\u2019s ability to secure funds or raise capital for acquisitions and other projects, which in turn, could cause the Company to use deposits or other funding sources for such projects.\nIn addition, the volatility of the markets and weakness of global economies could affect the strength of the Company\u2019s customers or counterparties, their willingness to do business with, and/or their ability or willingness to fulfill their obligations to the Company, which could further affect the Company\u2019s results of operations. Conditions such as high unemployment, weak corporate performance, and soft real estate markets, could negatively affect the volume of loan originations and prepayments, the value of the real estate securing the Company\u2019s mortgage loans, and borrowers\u2019 ability or willingness to repay loan obligations, all of which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nFuture Events May Result in a Valuation Allowance Against the Company\u2019s Deferred Tax Asset Which May have a Significant Effect on the Company\u2019s Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nAs of December 31, 2014, the Company\u2019s net deferred tax asset was $25.6 million. Management evaluates this asset on an on-going basis to determine if a valuation allowance is required. Management determined that no valuation allowance was required to be recorded against the Company\u2019s net deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2014. This determination required significant management judgment based on positive and negative considerations. Such considerations included recent trends in earnings, expectations for the Company\u2019s future earnings, the duration of federal and state net operating loss carryforward periods, and other factors. Future events or circumstances could result in conditions that differ significantly from management\u2019s current assessment of these positive and negative considerations, particularly as such relate to the Company\u2019s future earnings. Changes in these considerations could result in a significant valuation allowance being recorded against the Company\u2019s net deferred tax asset, which could have a significant effect on the Company\u2019s future results of operations and financial condition.\nRecent and Future Legislation and Rulemaking May Significantly Affect the Company\u2019s Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nInstability, volatility, and failures in the credit and financial institutions markets in recent years have led regulators and legislators to consider and/or adopt proposals that will significantly affect financial institutions and their holding companies, including the Company. Legislation such as the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, and the Dodd-Frank Act, were adopted. Although designed to address safety, soundness, and compliance issues in the banking system, there can be no assurance as to the ultimate impact of these actions on financial markets, which could have a material, adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, access to credit or the value of the Company\u2019s securities. Further legislative and regulatory proposals to reform the U.S. financial system would also affect the Company and the Bank.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB, which has broad rulemaking and enforcement authority with respect to entities, including financial institutions, that offer to consumers covered financial products and services. The CFPB is required to adopt rules identifying practices or acts that are unfair, deceptive or abusive relating to any customer transaction for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service. Although management does not expect rules implemented to date to have a significant adverse impact on the Company, the full scope of the impact of the CFPB\u2019s authority has not yet been determined as all related rules have not all yet been adopted. The Company cannot yet determine the costs and limitations related to these additional regulatory requirements; however, the costs of compliance and the effect on its business may have a material adverse effect on the Company's operations and results.\nThe Interest Rate Environment May Have an Adverse Impact on the Company\u2019s Net Interest Income\nVolatile interest rate environments make it difficult for the Company to coordinate the timing and amount of changes in the rates of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings with the rates of interest it earns on loans and securities. In addition, volatile interest rate environments cause corresponding volatility in the demand by individuals and businesses for the loan and deposit products offered by the Company. These factors have a direct impact on the Company\u2019s net interest income, and consequently, its net income. Future interest rates could continue to be volatile and management is unable to predict the impact such volatility would have on the net interest income and profits of the Company.\nStrong Competition Within the Company\u2019s Market Area May Affect Net Income\nThe Company encounters strong competition both in attracting deposits from customers and originating loans to commercial and retail borrowers. The Company competes with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment banking firms. The Company\u2019s market area includes branches of several commercial banks that are substantially larger than the Company in terms of deposits and loans. In addition, tax-exempt credit unions operate in most of the Company\u2019s market area and aggressively price their products and services to a large part of the population. If competitors succeed in attracting business from the Company\u2019s customers, its deposits and loans could be reduced, which would likely affect earnings.\nDevelopments in the Marketplace, Such as Alternatives to Traditional Financial Institutions, or Adverse Publicity Could Affect the Company's Ongoing Business\nChanges in the marketplace are allowing consumers to use alternative means to complete financial transactions that previously had been conducted through banks. For example, consumers can increasingly maintain funds in accounts other than bank deposits or through the internet, or complete payment transactions without the assistance of banks. Continuation or acceleration of these trends, including newly developing means of communications and technology, could cause consumers to utilize fewer of the Company's services, which could have a material adverse affect on its results.\nFinancial institutions such as the Company continue to be under a high level of governmental, media, and other scrutiny, as to the conduct of their businesses, and potential issues and adverse developments (real and perceived) often receive widespread media attention. If there were to be significant adverse publicity about the Company, that publicity could affect its reputation in the marketplace. If the Company's reputation is diminished, it could affect its business and results of operations as well as the price of the Company's common stock.\nThe Company Is Subject to Security Risks and Failures and Operational Risks Relating to the Use of Technology that Could Damage Its Reputation and Business\nThe protection of customer data from potential breaches of the Company\u2019s computer systems is an increasing concern, as is the potential for disruption of the Company\u2019s internet banking services, through which it increasingly provides services, as well as other systems through which the Company provides services. The security of company and customer data and protection against disruptions of companies\u2019 computer systems are increasing matters of industry, customer, and regulatory scrutiny given the significant potential consequences of failures in these matters and the potential negative publicity surrounding instances of cybersecurity breaches. In addition, these risks can be difficult to predict or defend against, as the persons committing such attacks often employ novel methods of accessing or disrupting the computer systems of their targets.\nSecurity breaches in the Company\u2019s internet, telephonic, or other electronic banking activities could expose it to possible liability and damage its reputation. Any compromise of the Company\u2019s security also could deter customers from using its internet or other banking services that involve the transmission and/or retention of confidential information. The Company relies on standard internet and other security systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data. These precautions may not protect the Company\u2019s systems from compromises or breaches of its security measures, which could result in damage to the Company\u2019s reputation and business and affect its results of operations.\nAdditionally, as a financial institution, the Company\u2019s business is data intensive. Beyond the inherent nature of a financial institution that requires it to process and track extremely large numbers of financial transactions and accounts, the Company is required to collect, maintain, and keep secure significant data about its customers. These operations require the Company to obtain and maintain technology and security-related systems that are mission critical to its business. The Company\u2019s failure to do so could significantly affect its ability to conduct business and its customers' confidence in it. Further, the Company outsources a large portion of its data processing to third parties. If these third party providers encounter technological or other difficulties or if they have difficulty in communicating with the Company or if there is a breach of security, it will significantly affect the Company\u2019s ability to adequately process and account for customer transactions, which would significantly affect the Company\u2019s business operations and reputation.\nFurther, the technology affecting the financial institutions industry and consumer financial transactions is rapidly changing, with the frequent introduction of new products, services, and alternatives. The future success of the Company requires that it continue to adapt to these changes in technology to address its customers' needs. Many of the Company's competitors have greater technological resources to invest in these improvements. These changes could be costly to the Company and if the Company does not continue to offer the services and technology demanded by the marketplace, this failure to keep pace with change could materially affect its business, financial condition, and results of operation.\nThe Company\u2019s Ability to Grow May Be Limited if It Cannot Make Acquisitions\nThe Company will continue to seek to expand its banking franchise by growing internally, acquiring other financial institutions or branches, acquiring other financial services providers, and opening new offices. The Company\u2019s ability to grow through selective acquisitions of other financial institutions or branches will depend on successfully identifying, acquiring, and integrating those institution or branches. The Company has not made any acquisitions in recent years, as management has not identified acquisitions for which it was able to reach an agreement on terms management believed were appropriate and/or that met its acquisition criteria. The Company cannot provide any assurance that it will be able to generate internal growth, identify attractive acquisition candidates, make acquisitions on favorable terms, or successfully integrate any acquired institutions or branches.\nThe Company Depends on Certain Key Personnel and the Company\u2019s Business Could Be Harmed by the Loss of Their Services or the Inability to Attract Other Qualified Personnel\nThe Company\u2019s success depends in large part on the continued service and availability of its management team, and on its ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel, particularly customer relationship managers. The competition for these individuals can be significant, and the loss of key personnel could harm the Company\u2019s business. The Company cannot provide assurances that it will be able to retain existing key personnel or attract additional qualified personnel.", "PERMNO": 88792, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "BKMU"}
