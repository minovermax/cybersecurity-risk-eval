RISK FACTORS\nThe factors that are discussed below, as well as the matters that are generally set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents incorporated by reference herein, could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business serves a limited number of large and sophisticated customers, and a substantial reduction in sales to one or more of these customers could adversely impact our operating results.\nA relatively limited number of customers account for a large percentage of our total net sales. Our top ten customers accounted for 56% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. Sales to Staples, our largest customer, amounted to approximately 14% of our 2016 net sales. Sales to Wal-Mart amounted to approximately 10% of our 2016 net sales.\nOur large customers may seek to leverage their size to obtain favorable pricing and other terms. In addition, they have the ability to directly source their own private label products and to create and support new and competing suppliers. The loss of, or a significant reduction in sales to, one or more of our top customers, or significant changes to the terms on which we sell our products to our top customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur historical office superstore and wholesale customers may further transform their business models, which could adversely impact our sales and margins.\nOur historical customers, especially our large office superstore and wholesale customers, have steadily consolidated over the last two decades. Following a customer consolidation, the combined company typically takes actions to harmonize pricing from its suppliers, close retail outlets, reduce inventories and rationalize its supply chain, which negatively impacts our sales and margins. Customers who have consolidated or may consolidate in the future may not continue to buy from us across our different product segments or geographic regions or at the same levels as prior to consolidation, which could adversely impact our financial results.\nHistorically, consolidation of our customers has had a material impact on our sales and margins and continues to impact our business performance.\nRecently, these same customers have sought other means to address the challenges of increased competition, seeking to transform their businesses in a variety of ways. Such actions may result in our customers changing their historical buying patterns, which may result in further reductions in our sales and margins and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSee also \"- Shifts in the channels of distribution for our products could adversely impact our business\" and \"- Challenges related to the highly competitive business environments in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our ongoing business, results of operations and financial condition\" and \"Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\"\nRisks associated with currency volatility could adversely affect our sales, profitability, cash flow and results of operations.\nWith approximately 43% of our sales for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 arising from international operations, fluctuations in currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar can have a material impact on our results of operations. Our current risk exposure is primarily related to the Brazilian real, the Canadian dollar, the Euro, the Australian dollar, the British pound, the Mexican peso and the Japanese yen. Currency fluctuations impact the financial results of our non-U.S. operations, which are reported in U.S. dollars. As a result, a strong U.S. dollar reduces the dollar-denominated financial contributions from foreign operations and a weak U.S. dollar benefits us in the form of higher reported financial results.\nAdditionally, approximately half of the products we sell are sourced from China and other Far Eastern countries. The prices for these sourced products are denominated in U.S. dollars. Accordingly, movements in the value of local currencies relative to the U.S. dollar affect the cost of goods sold by our non-U.S. businesses when they source products from Asia. A weaker dollar decreases costs of goods sold and a stronger dollar increases costs of goods sold relative to the local selling price. In response to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we typically seek to raise prices in our international markets in an effort to recover lost gross margin. Due to competitive pressures and the timing of these price increases relative to the changes in currency exchange rates, it is often difficult to increase prices fast enough to fully offset the cumulative impact of the foreign-exchange-related inflation on our cost of goods sold in these markets. Additionally, where possible, we seek to hedge our exposure to provide more time to raise prices, but this is not always possible where our competitors are not similarly affected.\nWe cannot predict the rate at which the U.S. dollar will trade against other currencies in the future. When the U.S. dollar strengthens, it makes the dollar more valuable relative to other currencies in the global market, and negatively impacts the U.S. dollar value of our international sales, profits and cash flow and adversely impacts our ability to compete or competitively price our products in those markets. Conversely, if the U.S. dollar weakens, it has the opposite effect.\nAdditionally, as we increase the size of our business in international markets, through acquisitions (including the PA and Esselte Acquisitions) or otherwise, or if we increase the amount of products we source from China and other Far Eastern countries, our exposure to the risks associated with currency volatility increases. See also \"- Growth in emerging geographies may be difficult to achieve and exposes us to risks not present or not as prevalent in more established markets, such as greater economic volatility, unstable political conditions and civil unrest.\"\nShifts in the channels of distribution for our products could adversely impact our business.\nOur customers operate in a very competitive environment. Historically, large office superstores and wholesalers have maintained a significant market share in business, academic and dated goods, but these customers are experiencing increasing competition from mass merchandisers and on-line retailers. This shift in channels may impact our sales and margins due to the more limited range of products carried in these alternate channels and their overall inventory efficiencies. Additionally, if we are unable to grow sales and gain market share with customers operating in these alternate channels of distribution or if the margins we realize in these channels are lower, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nChallenges related to the highly competitive business environments in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our ongoing business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe operate in highly competitive business environment, which presents a number of challenges, including:\n\u2022\nlow barriers to entry;\n\u2022\nsophisticated and large customers who have the ability to source their own private label products;\n\u2022\nlimited retail space which constrains our ability to offer certain products;\n\u2022\ncompetitors with strong brands;\n\u2022\nimports from a range of countries, including countries with lower production costs;\n\u2022\ncompetitors' ability to source lower cost products in local currencies; and\n\u2022\ncompetition from a range of products and services, including electronic, digital or web-based products that can replace or render obsolete or less desirable some of the products we sell.\nAs a result, our business is likely to be affected by: (1) decisions and actions of our customers to increase their purchases of private label products or otherwise change product assortments; (2) decisions of current and potential suppliers of competing products to take advantage of low entry barriers to expand their production or lower prices; and (3) decisions of end-users of our products to expand their use of lower priced, substitute or alternative products. Any such decisions could result in lower sales and margins and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nHistorically, during periods of economic weakness and uncertainty, we have seen the above trends accelerate resulting in increased competition from private label and other branded and/or generic products that compete on price and quality and changes in end-user spending. Similarly, when the U.S. dollar is strong, we face more competition from locally produced products, which are paid for in local currency. We have recently experienced these competitive pressures due to economic weakness in certain international markets in which we operate, especially Brazil. See also \"- Sales of our products may be adversely affected by issues that affect business, commercial and consumer spending decisions during periods of economic uncertainty or weakness,\" \"- Risks associated with currency volatility could adversely affect our sales, profitability, cash flow and results of operations\" and \"- Changes to current policies by the U.S. government could adversely affect our business.\"\nOur success partially depends on our ability to continue to develop and market innovative products that meet end-user demands, including price expectations.\nOur competitive position depends on continued investment in innovation and product development, manufacturing and sourcing, quality standards, marketing and customer service and support. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and offer products that appeal to the changing needs and preferences of our customers and end-users in a market where many of our product categories are affected by continuing improvements in technology and shortened product lifecycles and others are experiencing secular declines. We may not have sufficient resources to make the investments that may be necessary to anticipate\nor react to the changing needs, and we may not identify, develop and market products successfully or otherwise be able to maintain our competitive position.\nSales of our products may be adversely affected by issues that affect business, commercial and consumer spending decisions during periods of economic uncertainty or weakness.\nDemand for our products, especially business machines and other durable goods, can be very sensitive to uncertain or weak economic conditions. In addition, during periods of economic uncertainty or weakness, we tend to see the demand for our products decrease, increased competition from private label and other branded and/or generic products that compete on price and quality, and our reseller customers reduce inventories. In addition, end-users tend to purchase more lower-cost, private label or other economy brands, more readily switch to electronic, digital or web-based products serving similar functions, or forgo certain purchases altogether. As a result, adverse changes in economic conditions or sustained periods of economic uncertainty or weakness could negatively affect our earnings and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nThe economic climate in some of countries in which we operate is unstable, negatively impacting our sales, profitability and cash flow in these countries, and we expect that this situation may continue. Any economic recovery in these countries may be weak and slow to materialize.\nWe rely extensively on information technology systems to operate, transact and otherwise manage our business. Any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security breach of that technology or its supporting infrastructure could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe rely extensively on our information technology systems, many of which are outsourced to third-party service providers. We depend on these systems and our third-party service providers to effectively manage our business and execute the production, distribution and sale of our products as well as to manage and report our financial results and run other support functions. Although we have implemented service level agreements and have established monitoring controls, if our outsourcing vendors fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory levels, our business could suffer. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, or a breach in the security of these systems could disrupt service to our customers, negatively impact our ability to report our financial results in a timely and accurate manner, damage our reputation and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur information technology general controls are an important element of our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures. Failure to successfully execute our information technology general controls could adversely impact the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures and impair our ability to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner.\nIf services to our customers are negatively impacted by the failure or breach of our information systems, or if we are unable to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner or to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures are effective, investor, supplier and customer confidence in our reported financial information as well as market perception of our Company and/or the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur information technology and other systems are subject to cyber security risk, including misappropriation of customer information or other breaches of information security.\nWe rely upon sophisticated information technology networks, systems and infrastructure, some of which are managed by third-parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. Additionally, we collect and store sensitive data, including proprietary business and personal information. Despite security measures, our information technology networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attack by hackers or breaches, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, natural disasters or other catastrophic events. Likewise, data privacy or security breaches by employees and others with permitted access to our systems, including in some cases third-party service providers to which we may outsource certain business functions, may pose a risk that sensitive data, including proprietary business information, intellectual property or personal information, may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. Security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations, compromise information belonging to us and our customers and suppliers, and expose us to liability, which could adversely impact our business and/or result in the loss of critical or sensitive information, which could result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm.\nChanges to current policies by the U.S. government could adversely affect our business.\nWe anticipate possible changes to current policies by the U.S. government that could affect our business, including potentially through increased import tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade relations with other countries (e.g., Mexico and China) and/or changes to U.S. tax laws. The imposition of tariffs or other trade barriers could increase our costs in certain markets, and may cause our customers to find alternative sourcing. In addition, other countries may change their own policies on business and foreign investment in companies in their respective countries. Additionally, it is possible that U.S. policy changes and uncertainty about policy could increase the volatility of currency exchange rates, which could impact our results of operations and financial condition. Tax changes could have different impacts depending on the specific policies enacted.

Moreover, the profitable growth of our business in emerging markets, through both organic investments and through acquisitions, is a key element to our long-term growth strategy.\nEmerging markets generally involve more financial and operational risks than more mature markets. In some cases, emerging markets have greater political and economic volatility, greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions, are more susceptible to corruption, and are in locations where it may be more difficult to impose corporate standards and procedures and the extraterritorial laws of the United States. Negative or uncertain political climates and military disruptions in developing and emerging markets could also adversely affect us. Further, weak legal systems may affect our ability to protect our intellectual property, contractual and other rights.\nAs we seek to grow our business in these emerging markets, we increase our exposure to these financial and operational risks as well as legal and other risks, including currency transfer restrictions, the impact of currency fluctuations, hyperinflation or devaluation, changes in international trade policies and regulations (including import and export restrictions), the lack of well-established or reliable legal systems, corruption, adverse economic conditions, political actions or instability, terrorism and civil unrest. Likewise, our cost of doing business increases due to costs of compliance with complex and numerous foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act, and regulations on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries, which, from time to time, result in significant cash balances in foreign countries due to limitations on the repatriation of funds.

Failure to properly identify, value, manage and integrate any of the acquisitions or to expand into adjacent categories may impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOne key element of our growth strategy involves acquisitions. We are focused on acquiring companies that are either in our existing categories or geographic markets to enhance our ability to compete effectively and realize cost synergies, or that have the potential to accelerate our growth or our entry into adjacent product categories.\nWe may not be successful in identifying suitable acquisition opportunities, prevailing against competing potential acquirers, negotiating appropriate acquisition terms, obtaining financing, completing proposed acquisitions, integrating acquired businesses or expanding in new markets or product categories. In addition, an acquisition may not perform as anticipated, be accretive to earnings or prove to be beneficial to our operations and cash flow. If we fail to effectively identify, value, consummate, manage\nand integrate any acquired company we may not realize the potential growth opportunities or achieve the synergies or financial results anticipated at the time of its acquisition.\nAn acquisition could also adversely impact our operating performance as a result of the issuance of acquisition-related debt, pre-acquisition assumed liabilities, acquisition expense and the amortization of acquisition assets or possible future impairments of goodwill or intangible assets associated with the acquisition.\nTo the extent acquisitions increase our exposure to emerging markets, the risks associated with doing business in these markets will increase. See also \"- Growth in emerging geographies may be difficult to achieve and exposes us to risks not present or not as prevalent in more established markets, such as greater economic volatility, unstable political conditions and civil unrest.\"\nAdditionally, part of our strategy is to expand our product assortment into new and adjacent product categories with a higher growth profile. There can be no assurance that we will successfully execute these strategies. If we are unable to successfully increase sales by expanding our product assortment, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe may face challenges in integrating Pelikan Artline and Esselte with our operations following the PA and Esselte Acquisitions.\nIn May 2016, we completed the PA Acquisition, and the Esselte Acquisition (\u201cEsselte\u201d) was completed in January 2017.\nWe may face challenges in integrating Pelikan Artline and Esselte with our existing operations. These challenges may include, among other things, integrating Pelikan Artline and Esselte while carrying on the ongoing operations of each business; integrating the business cultures of Pelikan Artline and Esselte and ACCO; possible difficulties in retaining key employees and key customers of ACCO, Pelikan Artline and Esselte; and the difficulty of integrating the acquired business's finance, accounting and other business systems without negatively impacting our internal control over financial reporting, our disclosure controls and procedures and compliance with the regulatory requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nThe process of integrating operations also could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of one or more of our businesses, including the Pelikan Artline and Esselte businesses. Members of our senior management may need to devote considerable amounts of time to the integration process, which will decrease the time they will have to manage the businesses. If our senior management is not able to effectively manage the integration processes, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, our business and financial results could suffer.\nAdditionally, we expect that we will realize synergy savings and other financial and operating benefits from our acquisition of Pelikan Artline and Esselte. Our success in realizing these synergy savings and other financial and operating benefits, and the timing of this realization depends on the successful integration of the business operations of Pelikan Artline and Esselte with ACCO. We cannot predict with certainty if or when these synergy savings and other benefits will occur, or the extent to which they actually will be achieved.\nFinally, the integration of Pelikan Artline and Esselte will involve changes to, or implementation of critical information technology systems, modifications to our internal controls systems, processes and information technology systems, and the establishment of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting necessary to meet our obligations as a publicly traded company in the U.S. Failure to successfully complete any of these tasks could adversely affect our internal control over financial reporting, our disclosure controls and procedures and our ability to effectively and timely report our financial results. If we are unable to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner and establish internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures that are effective, our business, results of operation and financial condition, investor, supplier and customer confidence in our reported financial information, the market perception of our Company and/or the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe market for computer products is rapidly changing and highly competitive.\nWe sell computer products in a market that is characterized by rapid technological changes, short product life cycles and a dependency on the introduction by third party manufacturers of new products and devices, which drives demand for accessories sold by the Company. To compete successfully, we need to anticipate and bring to market innovative new accessories in a timely and effective way, which requires significant skills and investment. We may not have sufficient market intelligence, talent or resources to successfully meet these challenges. Additionally, the short product life cycles increase the risk that our products will become commoditized or obsolete and that we could be left with an excess of old and slow-moving inventory. Rapid changes in technology, shifting demand for personal computers, laptops, tablets and mobile devices, as well as delays in the introduction of\nnew technology and our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes and delays, could adversely affect the demand for our products and have an adverse effect on the business, results of operations and financial condition. Recently, rapid changes in technology led to the commoditization of many of our tablet accessories resulting in increased competition and a degradation in sales and margins. Ultimately, we elected to exit the commodity tablet and smartphone accessories business. See also \"Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\"\nLitigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation.\nIn connection with our May 1, 2012 acquisition of Mead Consumer and Office Products business, we assumed all of the tax liabilities for the acquired foreign operations including Tilibra Produtos de Papelaria Ltda. (\"Tilibra\"). In December of 2012, the Federal Revenue Department of the Ministry of Finance of Brazil (\"FRD\") issued a tax assessment (the \"Brazilian Tax Assessment\") against Tilibra, which challenged the tax deduction of goodwill from Tilibra's taxable income for the year 2007. A second assessment challenging the deduction of goodwill from Tilibra's taxable income for the years 2008, 2009 and 2010 was issued by FRD in October 2013.\nTilibra is disputing both of the tax assessments through established administrative procedures. We believe we have meritorious defenses and intend to vigorously contest these matters; however, there can be no assurances that we will ultimately prevail. We are still in the administrative stages of the process to challenge the FRD's tax assessments, and the ultimate outcome will not be determined until the Brazilian tax appeal process is complete, which is expected to take a number of years. In addition, Tilibra's 2011-2012 tax years remain open and subject to audit, and there can be no assurances that we will not receive additional tax assessments regarding the goodwill for one or both of those years. The time limit for issuing an assessment for 2011 expires in January 2018. If the FRD's initial position is ultimately sustained, the amount assessed would materially and adversely affect our cash flow in the year of settlement.\nBecause there is no settled legal precedent on which to base a definitive opinion as to whether we will ultimately prevail, we consider the outcome of this dispute to be uncertain. Since it is not more likely than not that we will prevail, in 2012, we recorded a reserve in the amount of $44.5 million (at December 31, 2012 exchange rates) in consideration of this contingency, of which $43.3 million was recorded as an adjustment to the purchase price and which included the 2007-2012 tax years plus penalties and interest through December 2012. Included in this reserve is an assumption of penalties at 75%, which is the standard penalty. While there is a possibility that a penalty of 150% could be imposed, based on the facts in our case and existing precedent, we believe the likelihood of a 150% penalty being imposed is not more likely than not at December 31, 2016. In the meantime, we continue to actively monitor administrative and judicial court decisions and evaluate their impact, if any, on our legal assessment of the ultimate outcome of our case. In addition, we will continue to accrue interest related to this contingency until such time as the outcome is known or until evidence is presented that we are more likely than not to prevail. During 2016, 2015 and 2014, we accrued additional interest as a charge to current tax expense of $2.8 million, $2.7 million and $3.2 million, respectively. At current exchange rates, our accrual through December 31, 2016, including tax, penalties and interest is $37.3 million.\nThere are various other claims, lawsuits and pending actions against us incidental to our operations. It is the opinion of management that (other than the Brazilian Tax Assessment) the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. However, there is no assurance that we will ultimately be successful in our defense of any of these matters or that an adverse outcome in any matter will not affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flow.\nOutsourcing the production of certain of our products, our information technology systems and other administrative functions could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe outsource certain manufacturing functions to suppliers in China, other Far Eastern countries and Eastern Europe. Outsourcing of product design and production creates a number of risks, including decreased control over the engineering and manufacturing processes resulting in unforeseen production delays or interruptions, inferior product quality, loss or misappropriation of trade secrets and other performance issues, which could result in cost overruns, delayed deliveries or shortages. Additionally, our suppliers must comply with our design and product content specifications, and all applicable laws, including product safety, security, labor and environmental laws. We also expect our suppliers to conform to our and our customers\u2019 expectations with respect to product safety, product quality and social responsibility, be responsive to our audits and otherwise be certified as meeting our and our customers\u2019 supplier codes of conduct. Failure to meet any of these requirements may result in our having to cease doing business with a supplier or cease production at a particular facility. Substitute suppliers might not be available or, if available, might be unwilling or unable to offer products on acceptable terms or in a timely manner. Any of these circumstances could result in unforeseen production delays and increased costs and negatively affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers, all of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nMoreover, if one or more of our suppliers is unable or unwilling to continue to provide products of acceptable quality, at acceptable cost or in a timely manner due to financial difficulties, insolvency or otherwise, or if customer demand for our products increases, we may be unable to secure sufficient additional capacity from our current suppliers, or others, in a timely manner or on acceptable terms. Any of these events could result in unforeseen production delays and increased costs and negatively affect our ability to deliver our products and services to our customers, all of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe also outsource important portions of our information technology infrastructure and systems support to third party service providers. Outsourcing of information technology services creates risks to our business, which are similar to those created by our product production outsourcing. If one or more of our information technology suppliers is unable or unwilling to continue to provide services at acceptable cost due to financial difficulties, insolvency or otherwise, or if our third party service providers experience a security breach or disruptions in service, our business could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, we outsource certain administrative functions, such as payroll processing, benefit plan administration and accounts payable to third party service providers and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies. If the service providers to which we outsource these functions do not perform effectively, we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings and may have to incur additional costs to correct errors they make. Depending on the function involved, such errors may lead to business disruption, processing inefficiencies or loss of, or damage to intellectual property, or harm to employee morale. See also \"- We rely extensively on information technology systems to operate, transact and otherwise manage our business. Any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security breach of that technology or its supporting infrastructure could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition,\" and \"- Our information technology and other systems are subject to cyber security risk, including misappropriation of customer information or other breaches of information security.\"\nContinued declines in the use of certain of our products, especially paper-based dated, time management and productivity tools, could adversely affect our business.\nA number of our products and brands consist of paper-based dated, time management and productivity tools that historically have tended to be higher-margin products. However, consumer preference for technology-based solutions for time management and planning continues to grow worldwide. Many consumers use or have access to electronic tools that may serve as substitutes for traditional paper-based time management and productivity tools. Accordingly, the continued introduction of new digital software applications and web-based services by companies offering time management and productivity solutions could continue to adversely impact the revenue and profitability of our largely paper-based portfolio of dated, time management and productivity products.\nAdditionally, the demand for other product categories, such as decorative calendars, ring binders and mechanical binding equipment, are also declining. A continued decline in the overall demand for any of the products we sell could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to risks associated with seasonality, which could adversely affect our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition.\nHistorically, our business has experienced higher sales and earnings in the third and fourth quarters of the calendar year. Two principal factors contribute to this seasonality: (1) we are a major supplier of products related to the \"back-to-school\" season, which occurs principally from June through September for our North American business and from November through February for our Australian and Brazilian businesses; and (2) several products we sell lend themselves to calendar year-end purchase timing, including AT-A-GLANCE\u00ae planners, paper organization and storage products (including bindery) and Kensington\u00ae computer accessories, which have higher sales in the fourth quarter driven by traditionally strong fourth-quarter sales of personal computers and tablets. As a result, we have generated, and expect to continue to generate, most of our earnings in the second half of the year and much of our cash flow in the first, third and fourth quarters as receivables are collected. If these typical seasonal increases in sales of certain products do not materialize or if sales of these product lines were to represent a larger overall percentage of our sales or profitability it may have an outsized impact on our business, which could adversely affect our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition.\nFluctuation in the costs of raw materials, labor and transportation and changes in international shipping capacity as well as issues affecting port availability and efficiency, such as labor strikes, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe primary materials used in the manufacturing of many of our products are paper, plastics, resin, polyester and polypropylene substrates, steel, wood, aluminum, melamine, zinc and cork. In general, our gross profit may be affected from time to time by fluctuations in the prices of these materials. We attempt to reduce our exposure to increases in these costs through a variety of measures, including obtaining price increases from our customers when appropriate as well as executing periodic purchases, future delivery contracts, longer-term price contracts and holding our own inventory. Likewise, we attempt to take advantage of price decreases by negotiating cost reductions with our suppliers to ensure that our customer pricing remains competitive. There can be no assurances that we will successfully negotiate price increases or decreases or that the other measures we take to manage the risk of fluctuation in raw material costs will be effective in avoiding a negative impact in our sales and profitability. See also \"Note 13. Derivative Financial Instruments\" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8. of this report.\nInflationary and other substantial increases and decreases in costs of materials, labor and transportation have occurred in the past and may recur, and raw materials may not continue to be available in adequate supply in the future. Shortages in the supply of any of the raw materials we use in our products and services, the availability of international shipping capacity or labor strife at ports we use, could result in price increases or decreases or negatively impact our ability to deliver our products to our customers, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSome of our suppliers are dependent upon other industries for raw materials as well as the other products and services necessary to produce the products they supply to us. Any adverse impacts to those industries could have a ripple effect on our suppliers, which could adversely impact their ability to supply us at levels or costs we consider necessary or appropriate for our business, or at all. Any such disruptions could negatively impact our ability to deliver products and services to our customers, which in turn could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to global environmental regulation and environmental risks, product content and product safety laws and regulations, international trade laws and regulations as well as laws, regulations and self-regulatory requirements relating to privacy and data security.\nOur business is subject to national, state, provincial and/or local environmental laws and regulations in both the United States and abroad, which govern the discharge and emission of certain materials and waste, and establish standards for their use, disposal and management. We are also subject to laws regulating the content of toxic chemicals and materials in the products we sell as well as laws, directives and self-regulatory requirements related to the safety of our products, law and regulations governing international trade as well as privacy and data security. There has also been a sharp increase in laws and regulations in Europe, the United States and elsewhere, imposing requirements on our handling of personal data, including data of employees, consumers and business contacts.\nAll of these laws, regulations and self-regulatory frameworks are complex and may change frequently. Capital and operating expenses required to comply with environmental, product content and product safety laws and regulations and information security and privacy obligations can be significant, and violations may result in substantial fines, penalties and civil damages as well as damage to our reputation. Any significant increase in our costs to comply with applicable environmental and product content and safety laws and obligations relating to privacy and data security as well as claims or liability arising from noncompliance with such laws, regulations and self-regulatory frameworks, and changes in tariffs or duties associated with the international transfer of goods could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition as well as damage to our reputation. See also, \"- Changes to current policies by the U.S. government could adversely affect our business.\"\nIn addition, as we expand our business into emerging and new markets, we increase the number of laws and regulations with which we are required to comply, which increases the complexity and costs of compliance as well as the risks of noncompliance. See also \"- Growth in emerging geographies may be difficult to achieve and exposes us to risks not present or not as prevalent in more established markets, such as greater economic volatility, unstable political conditions and civil unrest.\"\nOur pension costs and cash contributions could substantially increase as a result of volatility in the equity markets, changes in interest rates or other factors.\nOur defined benefit pension plans are not fully funded and the funding status of our plans is a significant factor in determining the net periodic benefit costs of our pension plans and the ongoing funding requirements of those plans. Changes in interest rates and the market value of plan assets impact the funded status of these plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future plan funding requirements. Our cash contributions to pension and defined benefit plans totaled $6.2 million in 2016; however\nthe exact amount of cash contributions made to pension plans in any year is dependent upon a number of factors, including the investment returns on pension plan assets and laws relating to pension funding requirements. A significant increase in our pension funding requirements could have an adverse impact on our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe also participate in a multi-employer pension plan for our union employees at our Ogdensburg, NY facility. The plan has reported significant underfunded liabilities and declared itself in critical and declining status. As a result, the trustees of the plan adopted a rehabilitation plan in an effort to forestall insolvency. Our required contributions to this plan could increase due to the shrinking contribution base resulting from the insolvency of, or withdrawal of other participating employers, from the inability or the failure of withdrawing participating employers to pay their withdrawal liability, from lower than expected returns on pension fund assets, and from other funding deficiencies. In the event that we withdraw from participation in the plan, we will be required to make withdrawal liability payments for a period of 20 years or longer in certain circumstances. The present value of our withdrawal liability payments would be recorded as an expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income and as a liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets in the first year of our withdrawal.\nIn connection with the Esselte Acquisition we have acquired substantial pension liabilities.\nSee also \"Part II, Item 7. Critical Accounting Policies - Employee Benefit Plans\" and \"Note 5. Pension and Other Retiree Benefits\" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8. of this report.\nImpairment of intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe have recorded significant amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets, which increased substantially due to acquisitions. The fair values of certain indefinite-lived trade names are not significantly above their carrying values. Recent events have significantly reduced the fair value of certain indefinite-lived trade names and future events may occur that could further adversely affect the reported value of our assets and require impairment charges, which could negatively affect our financial results. Such events may include, but are not limited to, a sustained decline in our stock price or sales of one or more of our branded product lines, or strategic decisions we make regarding how we use our brands in various global markets. As of December 31, 2016 the aggregate carrying value of indefinite-lived trade names not substantially above their fair values was $188.1 million, which relates to the following trade names, Mead\u00ae, Tilibra\u00ae and Hilroy\u00ae. See also \"Part II, Item 7. Critical Accounting Policies - Intangible Assets\", \" - Goodwill\" and \"Note 9. Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets\" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8, of this report.\nOur existing borrowing arrangements require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to debt payments and limits our ability to engage in certain activities. If we are unable to meet our obligations under these agreements or are contractually restricted from pursuing activities or transactions that we believe are in our long-term best interests, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $703.5 million of outstanding debt, which increased by approximately $326 million in early 2017 due to the borrowings to fund the Esselte Acquisition and related fees and expenses.\nOur debt service obligations require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operating activities to payments on our indebtedness, which reduces the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and product development efforts, potential acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes. Our indebtedness also may increase our vulnerability to economic downturns and changing market conditions and place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors that have less debt. In addition, as of December 31, 2016, $302.9 million of our outstanding debt is subject to floating interest rates, which increases our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.\nThe terms of our debt agreements also limit our ability to engage in certain activities and transactions that may be in our and our shareholders' long-term interest. Among other things, the covenants and financial ratios and tests contained in our debt agreements restrict or limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, incur certain liens on our assets, issue preferred stock or certain disqualified stock, make restricted payments, including investments, sell our assets or merge with other companies, and enter into certain transactions with affiliates. We are also required to maintain specified financial ratios under certain circumstances and satisfy financial condition tests. Our ability to comply with these covenants and financial ratios and tests may be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to continue to meet those covenants, ratios and tests.\nOur ability to meet our debt obligations, including our financial covenants, and to refinance our existing indebtedness upon maturity, will depend upon our future operating performance, which will be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory, business and other factors. Breach of any of the covenants, ratios and tests contained in the agreements governing our\nindebtedness, or our inability to pay interest on, or principal of, our outstanding debt as it becomes due, could result in an event of default, in which case our lenders could declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable. If our lenders accelerate our indebtedness or we are not able to refinance our debts at maturity, our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full such indebtedness and any other indebtedness that would become due as a result of such acceleration. If we then are unable to obtain replacement financing or any such replacement financing is on terms that are less favorable than the indebtedness being replaced, our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nShould any of the risks associated with our indebtedness be realized, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. See also \"Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\"\nOur failure to comply with customer contracts may lead to fines or loss of business, which could adversely impact our revenue and results of operations.\nOur contracts with our customers include specific performance requirements. In addition, some of our contracts with governmental customers are subject to various procurement regulations, contract provisions and other requirements. If we fail to comply with the specific provisions of our customer contracts or violate government contracting regulations, we could be subject to fines, suffer a loss of business or incur other penalties, which in the case of government contracts, could include suspension from further government contract opportunities. If our customer contracts are terminated, if we fail to meet our contractual obligations, are suspended or disbarred from government work, or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected, we could suffer a reduction in expected revenue and margins.\nShould one of our customers or suppliers experience financial difficulties or file for bankruptcy, our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur concentrated customer base increases our customer credit risk. Were any of our customers to face liquidity issues, become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, we could be adversely impacted due to not only a reduction in future sales but also delays in payment and/or losses associated with the inability to collect any outstanding accounts receivable from that customer. Such a result could adversely impact our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, should one of our suppliers or third party service providers experience financial difficulties our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. See also \"- Outsourcing the production of certain of our products, our information technology systems and other administrative functions could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\"\nOur inability to secure, protect and maintain rights to intellectual property could have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe own and license many patents, trademarks, brand names, trade names, and proprietary content that are, in the aggregate, important to our business. If third parties challenge the validity or enforceability of our intellectual property rights and we cannot successfully defend these challenges, or our intellectual property is invalidated or our patents expire, or if our licenses are terminated due to breach by us, or if licenses expire or are not renewed, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted. The loss, expiration or non-renewal of any individual trademark, patent or license may not be material to us, but the loss of a number of patents or trademarks, or the expiration or non-renewal of a significant number of licenses that relate to principal portions of our business, could negatively impact our competitive position in the market and have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe could also incur substantial costs to pursue legal actions relating to the unauthorized use by third parties of our intellectual property. If our brands become diluted, if our patents are infringed, or if our competitors introduce brands and products that cause confusion with our brands in the marketplace, the value of our brands may be diminished, which could adversely impact our sales and profitability.\nWe may also become involved in defending intellectual property infringement claims being asserted against us that could cause us to incur substantial costs, divert the efforts of our management and require us to pay substantial damages or require us to obtain a license, which might not be available on reasonable terms, if at all.\nProduct liability claims or regulatory actions could adversely affect our financial results or harm our reputation or the value of our end-user brands.\nClaims for losses or injuries purportedly caused by some of our products arise in the ordinary course of our business. In\naddition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments and penalties, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, product liability claims or regulatory actions, could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation in the marketplace or the value of our end-user brands. We also could be required to recall and possibly discontinue the sale of possible defective or unsafe products, which could result in adverse publicity, significant expenses and loss of revenue.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, including executive officers and other key personnel. We rely to a significant degree on compensating our executive officers and key employees with performance-based incentive awards that pay out only if specified performance goals have been met. To the extent these performance goals are not met and our incentive awards do not pay out, or pay out less than the targeted amount, it may motivate certain executive officers and key employees to seek other opportunities and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. The loss of key management personnel or other key employees or our potential inability to attract such personnel may adversely affect our ability to manage our overall operations and successfully implement our business strategy.\nOur stock price has been volatile historically and may continue to be volatile in the future.\nThe market price for our common stock has been volatile historically. Our results may be significantly affected by factors including those described elsewhere in this \"Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\" as well as the following:\n\u2022quarterly fluctuations in our operating results compared to market expectations;\n\u2022fluctuations in the stock market prices and volumes;\n\u2022changes in financial estimates by us or securities analysts and recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022actual or anticipated negative earnings or other announcements by us or our top customers;\n\u2022investors' perceptions of the office products industry; and\n\u2022the composition of our shareholders, particularly the presence of \"short sellers\" trading in our stock.\nVolatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensation to our employees or grant larger stock awards, which could hurt our operating results and reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders.\nMaterial disruptions resulting from telecommunication failures, labor strikes, power and/or water shortages, acts of God, war, terrorism, other geopolitical incidents or other circumstances outside our control could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nA disruption at one of our or at one of our suppliers' or third-party service providers' facilities (especially facilities in China and other Asia-Pacific countries as well as Latin America) or a disruption of international transportation or at ports could adversely impact production, and customer deliveries or otherwise negatively impact the operation of our business and result in increased costs. Such a disruption could occur as a result of any number of events including but not limited to a major equipment failure, labor stoppages, transportation failures affecting the supply and shipment of materials and finished goods, the unavailability of raw materials, severe weather conditions, natural disasters, civil unrest, war or terrorism and disruptions in utility and other services. Any such disruptions could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 90825, "SIC": 2780, "TIC": "ACCO"}
