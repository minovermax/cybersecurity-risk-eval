Risk Factors\nMany factors affect our business and results of operations, some of which are beyond our control. Additional risks and uncertainties we are unaware of, or we currently deem immaterial, also may become important factors that affect us. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial conditions or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our securities could decline, and our stockholders could lose all or part of their investment in our securities. This discussion contains forward-looking statements. See the section entitled FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS for a discussion of uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nAs a property and casualty insurer, we may experience significant losses and our financial results may vary from period to period due to our exposure to catastrophic events and severe weather conditions, the incidence and severity of which could be affected by climate change.\nOur property and casualty insurance operations expose us to claims arising from catastrophes. Catastrophes can be caused by various natural events, including hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, severe winter weather and fires; they can also be man-made, such as terrorist attacks (including those involving nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological events) or consequences of war or political instability. We may incur catastrophe losses that exceed the amount of:\n\u2022\ncatastrophe losses that we experienced in prior years;\n\u2022\ncatastrophe losses that, using third-party catastrophe modeling software, we projected could be incurred;\n\u2022\ncatastrophe losses that we used to develop prices for our products; or\n\u2022\nour current reinsurance coverage (which would cause us to have to pay such excess losses).\nThe incidence and severity of weather conditions are largely unpredictable, but the frequency and severity of property claims generally increase when severe weather conditions occur. A body of scientific evidence seems to indicate that climate change may be occurring. Climate change, to the extent that it may affect weather patterns, may cause an increase in the frequency and/or the severity of catastrophic events or severe weather conditions which, in addition to the attendant increase in claims-related costs, may also cause an increase in our reinsurance costs and/or negatively impact our ability to provide homeowners insurance to our policyholders in the future. Governmental entities may also respond to climate change by enacting laws and regulations that may adversely affect our cost of providing homeowners insurance in the future.\nCatastrophes may cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations during any reporting period; they may also materially harm our financial condition, which in turn may materially harm our liquidity and impair our ability to raise capital on acceptable terms or at all. In addition to catastrophes, the accumulation of losses from smaller weather-related events in any reporting period may cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity in that period.\nBecause we conduct the majority of our business in Florida, our financial results substantially depend on the regulatory, economic and weather conditions present in that state.\nAlthough we began writing policies outside of Florida in 2010, we still write approximately 74% of our premium in Florida; therefore, prevailing regulatory, legal, economic, political, demographic, competitive, weather and other conditions in Florida affect our revenues and profitability. Changes in conditions could make doing business in Florida less attractive for us and would have a more pronounced effect on us than it would on other insurance companies that are more geographically diversified.\nWe are subject to increased exposure to certain catastrophic events such as hurricanes, as well as an increased risk of losses. The occurrence of one or more catastrophic events or other conditions affecting losses in Florida may cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nUNITED INSURANCE HOLDINGS CORP.\nWe may enter new markets and there can be no assurance that our diversification strategy will be effective.\nAlthough we intend to continue focusing on Florida as a key market for our insurance products, we also may seek to take advantage of prudent opportunities to expand our core business into other states where we believe the independent agent distribution channel is strong. As a result of a number of factors, including the difficulties of finding appropriate expansion opportunities and the challenges of operating in an unfamiliar market, we may not be successful in this diversification. Additionally, in order to carry out any such strategy, we would need to obtain the appropriate licenses from the insurance regulatory authority of any such state.\nBecause we rely on insurance agents, the loss of these agent relationships or our ability to attract new agents could have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe currently market our policies to a broad range of prospective policyholders through over 4,000 independent agencies. Many of these agents are independent insurance agents that own their customer relationships, and our agency contracts with them limit our ability to directly solicit business from our existing policyholders. Independent agents most commonly represent other insurance companies and we do not control their activities. Historically, we have used marketing relationships with two well-known national insurance companies that do not write new homeowners insurance policies in Florida and two associations of independent insurance agents in Florida to attract and retain agents and agency groups. The loss of these marketing relationships could adversely impact our ability to attract new agents or retain our agency network.\nActual claims incurred may exceed our loss reserves for claims, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nLoss reserves represent our estimate of ultimate unpaid losses for claims that have been reported and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. Loss reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but instead represent our best estimate, generally utilizing actuarial expertise, historical information and projection techniques at a given reporting date.\nThe process of estimating our loss reserves involves a high degree of judgment and is subject to a number of variables. These variables can be affected by both internal and external events, such as changes in claims handling procedures, economic inflation, legal trends, legislative changes, and varying judgments and viewpoints of the individuals involved in the estimation process, among others.\nBecause of the inherent uncertainty in estimating loss reserves, including reserves for catastrophes, additional liabilities resulting from one insured event, or an accumulation of insured events, may exceed our existing loss reserves and cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition.\nOur financial results may vary from period to period based on the timing of our collection of government-levied assessments from our policyholders.\nOur insurance affiliates are subject to assessments levied by various governmental and quasi-governmental entities in the states in which we operate. While we may have the ability to recover these assessments from policyholders through policy surcharges in some states in which we operate, our payment of the assessments and our recoveries may not offset each other in the same reporting period in our financial statements and may cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a particular reporting period.\nViolation(s) of certain debt covenants related to our note payable to the Florida State Board of Administration could allow the Florida SBA to call the note, which could cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nUnited Property & Casualty Insurance Company is subject to certain debt covenants related to our note payable with the Florida SBA. As a remedy for covenant violations related to the note payable, the Florida SBA may make the note due and payable upon demand. Any demand by the Florida SBA for payment related to the note, whether immediate payment of the full balance or some other amount, is subject to approval by the insurance regulatory authority in Florida. Should the insurance regulatory authority grant approval of a demand for immediate full payment, such payment could cause a material adverse effect on our cash flows and financial condition. We were in compliance with the covenants under the note payable during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.\nUNITED INSURANCE HOLDINGS CORP.\nOur failure to implement and maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting in our business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price.\nWe have complied with the provisions regarding annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 during 2014 and 2013.\nIf we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls in accordance with applicable standards as then in effect, and as supplemented or amended from time to time, we may be unable to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404. Moreover, effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports. If we cannot produce reliable financial reports or otherwise maintain appropriate internal controls, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the market price for our stock could decline.\nIf we experience difficulties with technology, data security and/or outsourcing relationships, our ability to conduct our business could be negatively impacted.\nWhile technology can streamline many business processes and ultimately reduce the cost of operations, technology initiatives present certain risks. Our business is highly dependent upon our information technology systems and upon our contractors' and third-party administrators' ability to perform, in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion, necessary business functions such as the processing of policies and the adjusting of claims. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and often depend on these third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or a third-party system fails or experiences an interruption. If sustained or repeated, such a business interruption, system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business, provide customer service, pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions.\nDespite our implementation of security measures, our information technology systems are vulnerable to computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyber-attacks, system failures and similar disruptions. A material breach in the security of our information technology systems and data could include the theft of our confidential or proprietary information, including trade secrets and the personal information of our customers, claimants and employees. From time to time, we have experienced threats to our data and information technology systems, including malware and computer virus attacks, unauthorized access, system failures and disruptions. To the extent that any disruptions or security breaches result in a loss or damage to our data or inappropriate disclosure of proprietary or confidential information, it could cause significant damage to our reputation, adversely affect our relationships with our customers, result in litigation, increased costs and/or regulatory penalties, and ultimately harm our business. Third parties to whom we outsource certain of our functions are also subject to the risks outlined above, any one of which may result in our incurring substantial costs and other negative consequences, including a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nLoss of key vendor relationships or failure of a vendor to protect personal information of our customers, claimants or employees could affect our operations.\nWe rely on services and products provided by many vendors. These include, for example, vendors of computer hardware and software and vendors of services such as claim adjustment services and human resource benefits management services. In the event that one or more of our vendors suffers a bankruptcy or otherwise becomes unable to continue to provide products or services, or fails to protect personal information of our customers, claimants or employees, we may suffer operational impairments and financial losses.\nOur success has been and will continue to be greatly influenced by our ability to attract and retain the services of senior management.\nOur senior executive officers play an integral role in the development and management of our business. We do not maintain any key person life insurance policies on any of our officers or employees. The loss of the services of any of our senior executive officers could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or future prospects.\nUNITED INSURANCE HOLDINGS CORP.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY\nBecause we are smaller than some of our competitors, we may lack the resources to increase or maintain our market share.\nThe property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive, and we believe it will remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future. The principal competitive factors in our industry are price, service, commission structure and financial condition. We compete with other property and casualty insurers that write coverage in the same territories in which we write coverage; some of those insurers have greater financial resources and have a longer operating history than we do. In addition, our competitors may offer products for alternative forms of risk protection. Competition could limit our ability to retain existing business or to write new business at adequate rates, and such limitation may cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nState regulations limiting rate increases and requiring us to underwrite business in certain areas are beyond our control and may adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition.\nStates have from time to time passed legislation, and regulators have taken action, that has the effect of limiting the ability of insurers to manage catastrophe risk, such as legislation prohibiting insurers from reducing exposures or withdrawing from catastrophe-prone areas, or mandating that insurers participate in residual markets. In addition, following catastrophes, there are sometimes legislative initiatives and court decisions which seek to expand insurance coverage for catastrophe claims beyond the original intent of the policies. Further, our ability to increase pricing to the extent necessary to offset rising costs of catastrophes requires approval of insurance regulatory authorities.\nOne example of such legislation occurred following the 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons, when the Florida legislature required all insurers issuing replacement cost policies to pay the full replacement cost of damaged properties without depreciation whether or not the insureds repaired or replaced the damaged property. Under prior law, insurers would have paid the depreciated amount of the property until insureds commenced repairs or replacement. This law has led to an increase in disagreements regarding the scope of damage. Despite our efforts to adjust claims and promptly pay meritorious amounts, our operating results have been affected by a claims environment in Florida that produces opportunities for fraudulent or overstated claims.\nOur ability or willingness to manage our catastrophe exposure by raising prices, modifying underwriting terms or reducing exposure to certain geographies may be limited due to considerations of public policy, the evolving political environment and our ability to penetrate other geographic markets, which may cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We cannot predict whether and to what extent new legislation and regulations that would affect our ability to manage our exposure to catastrophic events will be adopted, the timing of adoption or the effects, if any, they would have on our ability to manage our exposure to catastrophic events.\nThe insurance industry is heavily regulated and further restrictive regulation may reduce our profitability and limit our growth.\nThe insurance industry is extensively regulated and supervised. Insurance regulatory authorities generally design insurance rules and regulations to protect the interests of policyholders, and not necessarily the interests of insurers, their stockholders and other investors. Regulatory systems also address authorization for lines of business, capital and surplus requirements, limitations on the types and amounts of certain investments, underwriting limitations, licensing, transactions with affiliates, dividend limitations, changes in control, premium rates and a variety of other financial and non-financial components of an insurer\u2019s business.\nIn recent years, the state insurance regulatory framework has come under increased federal scrutiny. Although the United States federal government does not directly regulate the insurance business, changes in federal legislation, regulation and/or administrative policies in several areas, including changes in financial services regulation and federal taxation, could negatively affect the insurance industry and us. In addition, Congress and some federal agencies from time to time investigate the current condition of insurance regulation in the United States to determine whether to impose federal or national regulation or to allow an optional federal charter, similar to the option available to most banks. Further, the NAIC and state insurance regulators continually reexamine existing laws and regulations, specifically focusing on modifications to holding company regulations,\nUNITED INSURANCE HOLDINGS CORP.\ninterpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws and regulations. We cannot predict what effect, if any, proposed or future legislation or NAIC initiatives may have on the manner in which we conduct our business.\nAs part of ongoing, industry-wide investigations, we may from time to time receive subpoenas and written requests for information from government agencies and authorities at the state or federal level. If we are subpoenaed for information by government agencies and authorities, potential outcomes could include enforcement proceedings or settlements resulting in fines, penalties and/or changes in business practices that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, these investigations may result in changes to laws and regulations affecting the industry.\nChanges to insurance laws or regulations, or new insurance laws and regulations, may be more restrictive than current laws or regulations and could cause material adverse effects on our results of operations and our prospects for future growth. Additionally, our failure to comply with certain provisions of applicable insurance laws and regulations may cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur inability to obtain reinsurance on acceptable terms would increase our loss exposure or limit our ability to underwrite policies.\nWe use, and we expect to continue to use, reinsurance to help manage our exposure to property and casualty risks. The availability and cost of reinsurance are each subject to prevailing market conditions beyond our control which can affect business volume and profitability. We may be unable to maintain our current reinsurance coverage, to obtain additional reinsurance coverage in the event our current reinsurance coverage is exhausted by a catastrophic event, or to obtain other reinsurance coverage in adequate amounts or at acceptable rates. Similar risks exist whether we are seeking to replace coverage terminated during the applicable coverage period or to renew or replace coverage upon its expiration. We provide no assurance that we can obtain sufficient reinsurance to cover losses resulting from one or more storms in the future, or that we can obtain such reinsurance in a timely or cost-effective manner. If we are unable to renew our expiring coverage or to obtain new reinsurance coverage, either our net exposure to risk would increase or, if we are unwilling to accept an increase in net risk exposures, we would have to reduce the amount of risk we underwrite. Either increasing our net exposure to risk or reducing the amount of risk we underwrite may cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition.\nIn each of the past ten years, a portion of our reinsurance protection has been provided by the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund (FHCF), a government sponsored entity that provides a layer of reinsurance protection at a price that is lower than otherwise available in the commercial market. The purpose of the FHCF is to protect and advance the state's interest in maintaining insurance capacity in Florida by providing reimbursements to insurers for a portion of their catastrophe hurricane losses. There is no assurance that FHCF will continue to make such reinsurance available on terms consistent with historical practice. The loss of reinsurance provided by FHCF would have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur inability to collect from our reinsurers on our reinsurance claims could cause a material adverse affect on our results of operation and financial condition.\nAlthough reinsurers are liable to us to the extent of the reinsurance coverage we purchase, we remain primarily liable as the direct insurer on all risks that we reinsure; therefore, our reinsurance agreements do not eliminate our obligation to pay claims. As a result, we are subject to risk with respect to our ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers. The risk could arise in two situations: (i) our reinsurers may dispute some of our reinsurance claims based on contract terms, and we may\nultimately receive partial or no payment, or (ii) the amount of losses that reinsurers incur related to worldwide catastrophes may materially harm the financial condition of our reinsurers and cause them to default on their obligations.\nWhile we will attempt to manage these risks through underwriting guidelines, collateral requirements and other oversight mechanisms, our efforts may not be successful. As a result, our exposure to credit risk may cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nOur investments are subject to market risks that may result in reduced returns or losses.\nWe expect investment returns to contribute to our overall profitability. Accordingly, fluctuations in interest rates or in the fixed-maturity, equity or alternative-investment markets may cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nUNITED INSURANCE HOLDINGS CORP.\nChanges in the general interest rate environment will affect our returns on, and the fair value of, our fixed maturities and short-term investments. A decline in interest rates reduces the returns available on new investments, thereby negatively impacting our net investment income. Conversely, rising interest rates reduce the fair value of existing fixed maturities. In addition, defaults under, or impairments of, any of these investments as a result of financial problems with the issuer and, where applicable, its guarantor of the investment could reduce our net investment income and net realized investment gains or result in investment losses.\nWe may decide to invest an additional portion of our assets in equity securities or other investments, which are subject to greater volatility than fixed maturities. General economic conditions, stock market conditions and many other factors beyond our control can adversely affect the fair value of our equity securities or other investments, and could adversely affect the realization of net investment income. As a result of these factors, we may not realize an adequate return on our investments, we may incur losses on sales of our investments and we may be required to write down the value of our investments, which could reduce our net investment income and net realized investment gains or result in investment losses.\nThe fair value of our investment portfolio is also subject to valuation uncertainties. The valuation of investments is more subjective when the markets are illiquid and may increase the risk that the estimated fair value of our investment portfolio is not reflective of prices at which actual transactions would occur.\nOur determination of the amount of other-than-temporary impairment to record varies by investment type and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective investment type. We revise our evaluations and assessments as conditions change and new information becomes available, and we reflect changes in other-than-temporary impairments in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. We base our assessment of whether other-than-temporary impairments have occurred on our case-by-case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in fair value. We can neither provide assurance that we have accurately assessed whether the impairment of one or more of our investments is temporary or other-than-temporary, nor that we have accurately recorded amounts for other-than-temporary impairments in our financial statements. Furthermore, historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments and additional impairments may need to be recorded in the future.\nOur portfolio may benefit from certain tax laws, including, but not limited to, those governing dividends-received deductions and tax credits. Federal and/or state tax legislation could be enacted that would lessen or eliminate some or all of these tax advantages and could adversely affect the value of our investment portfolio. This result could occur in the context of deficit reduction or various types of fundamental tax reform.\nThe property and casualty insurance industry is historically cyclical and the pricing and terms for our products may decline, which would adversely affect our profitability.\nHistorically, the financial performance of the property and casualty insurance industry has been cyclical, characterized by periods of severe price competition and excess underwriting capacity, or soft markets, followed by periods of high premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity, or hard markets. We cannot predict how long any given hard or soft market will last. Downturns in the property and casualty market may cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition.\nLosses from legal actions may be material to our operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\nTrends in the insurance industry regarding claims and coverage issues, such as increased litigation, the willingness of courts to expand covered causes of loss, and the escalation of loss severity may contribute to increased litigation costs and increase our loss exposure under the policies that we underwrite.\nAs industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. Examples of emerging claims and coverage issues include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\njudicial expansion of policy coverage and the impact of new theories of liability;\n\u2022\nplaintiffs targeting property and casualty insurers in purported class-action litigation relating to claims-handling and other practices; and\nUNITED INSURANCE HOLDINGS CORP.\n\u2022\nadverse changes in loss cost trends, including inflationary pressures in home repair costs.\nLoss severity in the property and casualty insurance industry may increase and may be driven by the effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claims and coverage issues. Multiparty or class action claims may present additional exposure to substantial economic, non-economic or punitive damage awards. The loss of even one of these claims, if it resulted in a significant award or a judicial ruling that was otherwise detrimental, could create a precedent in our industry that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. This risk of potential liability may make reasonable settlements of claims more difficult to obtain.\nWe are a defendant in a number of legal actions, including class action litigation, relating to those emerging claim and coverage issues. The propensity of policyholders and third party claimants to litigate and the willingness of courts to expand causes of loss and the size of awards may result in increased costs associated with litigation, render our loss reserves inadequate, and may be material to our operating results and cash flows for a particular quarter or annual period and to our financial condition. In addition, claims and coverage issues may not become apparent to us for some time after our issuance of the affected insurance policies. As a result, we may not know the full extent of liability under insurance policies we issue for many years after the policies are issued.\nA downgrade in our financial strength rating could adversely impact our business volume and our ability to access additional debt or equity financing.\nFinancial strength ratings have become increasingly important to an insurer\u2019s competitive position. Rating agencies review their ratings periodically, and our current ratings may not be maintained in the future. A downgrade in our rating could negatively impact our business volumes, as it is possible demand for our products in certain markets may be reduced or our ratings could fall below minimum levels required to maintain existing business. Additionally, we may find it more difficult to access the capital markets and we may incur higher borrowing costs. If significant losses, such as those resulting from one or more major catastrophes, or significant reserve additions were to cause our capital position to deteriorate significantly, or if one or more rating agencies substantially increase their capital requirements, we may need to raise equity capital in the future to maintain our ratings or limit the extent of a downgrade. For example, a trend of more frequent and severe weather-related catastrophes may lead rating agencies to substantially increase their capital requirements.\nWe cannot guarantee that our insurance affiliates, United Property & Casualty Insurance Company and Family Security Insurance Company, will maintain their current A (Exceptional) ratings by Demotech. Any downgrade of this rating could impact the acceptability of our products to mortgage lenders that require homeowners to buy insurance, reduce our ability to retain and attract policyholders and agents and damage our ability to compete, which may cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nRISKS RELATED TO AN INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMON STOCK\nFuture sales of substantial amounts of our common stock by us or our existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decrease.\nWe have registered up to $75,000,000 of our securities, which we may sell from time to time in one or more offerings. Additional equity financings or other share issuances by us could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Sales by existing stockholders of a large number of shares of our common stock in the public trading market (or in private transactions), or the perception that such additional sales could occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease.\nDividend payments on our common stock in the future is uncertain.\nWe have paid dividends on our common stock in the past; however, we provide no assurance or guarantee that we will continue to pay dividends in the future. Therefore, investors who purchase our common stock may only realize a return on their investment if the value of our common stock appreciates.\nThe declaration and payment of dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be dependent upon our profits, financial requirements and other factors, including legal and regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends from our subsidiaries, general business conditions and such other factors as our Board of Directors deems relevant.\nUNITED INSURANCE HOLDINGS CORP.\nThe substantial ownership of our common stock by our officers and directors allows them to exert significant control over us.\nOur officers and directors beneficially owned approximately 21% of UPC Insurance at December 31, 2014. Our officers' and directors' interests may conflict with the interests of other holders of our common stock and our officers and directors may take action affecting us with which other stockholders may disagree. Our officers and directors, acting together, have the ability to exert significant influence over the following:\n\u2022\nthe nomination, election and removal of our Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nthe adoption of amendments to our charter documents;\n\u2022\nmanagement and policies; and\n\u2022\nthe outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to our stockholders for approval, including mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets.\nProvisions in our charter documents and the shareholder rights plan that we adopted may make it harder for others to obtain control of us even though some stockholders might consider such a development to be favorable.\nOur charter and bylaws contain provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals our stockholders may consider to be in their best interests. Our Board of Directors is divided into two classes, each of which will generally serve for a term of two years with only one class of directors being elected in each year. At a given annual meeting, only a portion of our Board of Directors may be considered for election. Since our \u201cstaggered board\u201d may prevent our stockholders from replacing a majority of our Board of Directors at certain annual meetings, it may entrench our management and discourage unsolicited\nstockholder proposals that may be in the best interests of our stockholders. Moreover, our Board of Directors has the ability to designate the terms of and issue a new series of preferred stock.\nWe have also adopted a shareholder rights plan that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or could discourage a third party from acquiring, our Company or a large block of our common stock. A third party that acquires 20% or more of our common stock could suffer substantial dilution of its ownership interest under the terms of the shareholder rights plan through the issuance of common stock to all stockholders other than the acquiring person. In certain circumstances the foregoing threshold may be reduced to 15%.\nTogether these provisions may make the removal of our management more difficult and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities.", "PERMNO": 13712, "SIC": 6331, "TIC": "UIHC"}
