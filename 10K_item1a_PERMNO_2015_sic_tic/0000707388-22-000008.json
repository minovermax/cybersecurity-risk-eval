This summary is qualified by reference to the full set of risk factors set forth in this Item.\n\u2022We have a history of annual net losses attributable to common stockholders which may continue and which may negatively impact our ability to achieve our growth initiatives.\n\u2022We rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could materially harm our business.\n\u2022We may not be able to achieve the anticipated synergies and benefits from business acquisitions.\n\u2022We face risks related to health pandemics, wars, inflation, and other widespread outbreaks of contagious disease, including COVID-19 and its variants, or other potential causes of global instability which could significantly disrupt our operations and impact our financial results.\n\u2022We are subject to particular risks associated with real estate ownership, which could result in unanticipated losses or expenses.\n\u2022Our revenues may decline due to reductions in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates.\n\u2022Our Diagnostic Services revenues may decline due to changes in diagnostic imaging regulations and the use of third party benefit managers by states and private payors to drive down diagnostic imaging volumes.\n\u2022Operating results may be adversely affected by changes in the costs and availability of supplies and materials.\n\u2022Our quarterly and annual financial results are difficult to predict and are likely to fluctuate from period to period.\n\u2022We spend considerable time and money complying with federal and state laws, regulations, and other rules which may fluctuate based on healthcare policy, and if we are unable to fully comply with such laws, regulations, and other rules, we could face substantial penalties.\n\u2022We are subject to risks associated with self-insurance related to health benefits.\n\u2022A portion of our operations are located in a facility that may be at risk from fire, earthquakes, or other disasters.\n\u2022The medical device industry is litigious, which could result in the diversion of our management\u2019s time and efforts, and require us to incur expenses and pay damages that may not be covered by our insurance.\n\u2022If we cannot provide quality technical and applications support, we could lose customers and our business and prospects will suffer.\n\u2022Our long-term results depend upon our ability to improve existing products and services and develop, introduce, and market new products and services successfully.\n\u2022Our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology through patents and other means is uncertain.\n\u2022The measures that we use to protect the security of our intellectual property and other proprietary rights may not be adequate, which could result in the loss of legal protection for, and thereby diminish the value of, such intellectual property and other rights or we may need to enter into costly license agreements in the future.\n\u2022If we are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, it would be costly and time consuming, and an unfavorable outcome in that litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\u2022Our issued patents could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court, at the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d) or other administrative agency, or in other lawsuits which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\n\u2022We may make financial investments in other businesses that may lose value.\n\u2022Our goodwill and other long-lived assets are subject to potential impairment that could negatively impact our earnings.\n\u2022If KBS is unable to maintain or establish its relationships with independent dealers and contractors who sell its homes, KBS revenue could decline.\n\u2022Due to the nature of our business, many of our expenses are fixed costs and if there are decreases in demand for products, it may adversely affect operating results.\n\u2022Due to the nature of the work we and our subsidiaries perform, we may be subject to significant liability claims and disputes.\n\u2022Our indebtedness could restrict our operations and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions.\n\u2022The Company Loan Agreements (as defined herein) governing our indebtedness contain restrictive covenants that restrict our operating flexibility and require that we maintain specified financial ratios. If we cannot comply with these covenants, we may be in default under one or more of the Company Loan Agreements.\n\u2022Substantially all of our assets (including the assets of our subsidiaries) have been pledged to lenders as security for our indebtedness under the Company Loan Agreements.\n\u2022The inability of our Company, KBS, EdgeBuilder or any of our other subsidiaries to comply with applicable financial covenants under the Company Loan Agreements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\n\u2022If we are unable to generate or borrow sufficient cash to make payments on our indebtedness, our financial condition would be materially harmed, our business could fail, and stockholders may lose all of their investment.\n\u2022Increases in interest rates could adversely affect our results from operations and financial condition.\n\u2022The market price of our common stock may be volatile, and the value of your investment could decline significantly.\n\u2022A possible \u201cshort squeeze\u201d due to a sudden increase in demand of our common stock that largely exceeds supply may lead to price volatility in our common stock.\n\u2022Payment of dividends on our common stock is prohibited unless we have declared and paid (or set apart for payment) full accumulated dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock, which also has a significant liquidation value.\n\u2022If we fail to pay dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock for six or more consecutive quarters, holders of our Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to elect two additional directors to our board of directors.\n\u2022We may not be able to redeem our Series A Preferred Stock upon a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined herein).\n\u2022As a smaller reporting company, we are subject to scaled disclosure requirements that may make it more challenging for investors to analyze and compare our results of operations and financial prospects.\n\u2022If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our stock, the price and trading volume of our securities could decline.\n\u2022The protective amendment contained in our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which is intended to help preserve the value of certain income tax assets, primarily NOLs, may have unintended negative effects.\n\u2022Our stockholder rights plan, or \u201cpoison pill,\u201d includes terms and conditions which could discourage a takeover or other transaction that stockholders may consider favorable.\n\u2022Anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law may prevent or delay removal of current management or a change in control.\n\u2022We expect to be limited in our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards to reduce our future tax liability as a result of our recent Offering.\n\u2022Material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could have a significant adverse effect on our business and the price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe have a history of annual net losses attributable to common stockholders which may continue and which may negatively impact our ability to achieve our growth initiatives.\nOur total stockholders\u2019 equity decreased to $16.8 million as of December 31, 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we had revenue of $106.6 million, compared to revenue of $78.2 million for the comparable period in 2020. We had a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $8.4 million for the comparable 2020 period. There can be no assurance that, even if our revenue increases, our future operations will result in net income attributable to common stockholders. Our failure to increase our revenues or improve our gross margins will harm our business. We may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. If our revenues grow more slowly than we anticipate, our gross margins fail to improve or our operating expenses exceed our expectations, our operating results will suffer. The prices we charge for our products and services may decrease, which would reduce our revenues and harm our business. If we are unable to sell our products at acceptable prices relative to our costs, or if we fail to develop and introduce on a timely basis new products from which we can derive additional revenues, our financial results will suffer.\nWe rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could materially harm our business.\nWe rely on information technology and systems, including the Internet, commercially available software, and other applications, to process, transmit, store, and safeguard information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes, including financial transactions and maintenance of records, which may include personal identifying information and other valuable or confidential information. If we experience material failures, inadequacies, or interruptions or security failures of our information technology, we could incur material costs and losses. Further, third-party vendors could experience similar events with respect to their information technology and systems that impact the products and services they provide to us or to our customers. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools, and monitoring, as well as other applications and internal procedures and personnel, to provide security for processing, transmitting, storing, and safeguarding confidential information such as personally identifiable information related to our employees and others, information regarding financial accounts, and information regarding customers and vendors. We take various actions, and we incur significant costs, to maintain and protect the operation and security of our information technology and systems, including the data maintained in those systems. However, it is possible that these measures will not prevent the systems\u2019 improper functioning or a compromise in security, such as in the event of a cyberattack or the improper disclosure of information. Security breaches, computer viruses, attacks by hackers, online fraud schemes, and similar breaches can create significant system disruptions, shutdowns, fraudulent transfer of assets, or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. For example, in April 2019, we became aware that we had been a victim of criminal fraud commonly referred to as \u201cbusiness email compromise fraud.\u201d The incident involved the impersonation of one of our officers and improper access to his email, wherein the transfer by us of funds to a third-party account almost occurred.\nThe operation of our healthcare business includes use of complex information technology infrastructures, access to the information technology networks of our customers, as well as the collection of storing of patient information that is subject to HIPAA. In recent years, attacks on corporate information technology infrastructures have become more common and more sophisticated. Any successful attack on our network could severely impact our ability to conduct operations and could result in lost customers. Though we carry customary insurance for notification events in the event of a patient information breach under HIPAA, our coverage may not be sufficient to cover every situation, and any notification could severely impact our customer confidence and operations.\nDespite any defensive measures we take to manage threats to our business, our risk and exposure to these matters remain heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of such threats in light of advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography, new and sophisticated methods used by criminals including phishing, social engineering, or other illicit acts, or other events or developments that we may be unable to anticipate or fail to adequately mitigate. Any failure to maintain the security, proper function and availability of our information technology and systems, or certain third-party vendors\u2019 failure to similarly protect their information technology and systems that are relevant to our operations, or to safeguard our business processes, assets, and information could result in financial losses, interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, cause us to be in default of material contracts, and subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties, any of which could materially and adversely affect us.\nWe may not be able to achieve the anticipated synergies and benefits from business acquisitions.\nPart of our business strategy is to acquire businesses that we believe can complement or expand our current business activities, both financially and strategically. In September 2019, we acquired ATRM and its subsidiaries, including KBS, EdgeBuilder and Glenbrook, with these synergistic benefits in mind. Acquisitions involve many complexities, including, but\nnot limited to, risks associated with the acquired business\u2019 past activities, loss of customers, regulatory changes that are not anticipated, difficulties in integrating personnel and human resource programs, integrating ERP systems and other infrastructures, general underperformance of the business under our control versus the prior owners, unanticipated expenses and liabilities, and the impact on its internal controls of compliance with the regulatory requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. As a result, the realization of anticipated synergies or benefits from acquisitions may be delayed or substantially reduced, and could potentially result in the impairment of our investment in these businesses.\nWe face risks related to health pandemics, wars, inflation, and other widespread outbreaks of contagious disease, including COVID-19 and its variants, or other potential causes of global instability which could significantly disrupt our operations and impact our financial results.\nOur business has been disrupted and could be further materially adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, wars, or other causes of global instability. The outbreak and government measures taken in response have also had a significant impact, both direct and indirect, on businesses and commerce in 2021. Global concerns, such as coronavirus or other health concerns, wars, or global conflicts, could also result in social, economic, and labor instability in the United States or countries in which we or the third parties with whom we engage operate. The future progression of the outbreak and its effects on our business and operations are uncertain, as well as the impact of global conflicts on supply chains and inflation. We cannot presently predict the scope and severity of any potential business shutdowns or disruptions, including downturns in global economies and financial markets that could affect our future operating results. Any adverse impact on our results and financial condition could have a negative impact on our ability to comply with certain financial covenants in certain of our loan agreements (as described further below) and on your investment in our common stock.\nWe are subject to particular risks associated with real estate ownership, which could result in unanticipated losses or expenses.\nFollowing our recent acquisition of real estate, our business is subject to many risks that are associated with the ownership of real estate. For example, if our tenants do not renew their leases or default on their leases, we may be unable to re-lease the facilities at favorable rental rates. Other risks that are associated with real estate acquisition and ownership include, without limitation, the following:\n\u2022general liability, property and casualty losses, some of which may be uninsured;\n\u2022the inability to purchase or sell our assets rapidly due to the illiquid nature of real estate and the real estate market;\n\u2022leases which are not renewed or are renewed at lower rental amounts at expiration;\n\u2022the default by a tenant or guarantor under any lease;\n\u2022costs relating to maintenance and repair of our facilities and the need to make expenditures due to changes in governmental regulations, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act or remediation of unknown environmental hazards; and\n\u2022acts of God and acts of terrorism affecting our properties.\nOur revenues may decline due to reductions in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates.\nThe success of our business is largely dependent upon our medical professional customers\u2019 ability to provide diagnostic care to their patients in an economically sustainable manner, either through the purchase of our imaging systems or using our diagnostic services, or both. Our customers are directly impacted by changes (decreases and increases) in governmental and private payor reimbursements for diagnostic services. We are directly and indirectly impacted by changes in reimbursements. In our businesses, where we are indirectly affected by reimbursement changes, we make every effort to act as business partners with our physician customers. For example, in 2010, we proactively adjusted our diagnostic imaging services rates down due to the dramatic reimbursement declines that our customers experienced from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Reimbursements remain a source of concern for our customers and downward pressure on reimbursements causes greater pricing pressure on our services and influences the buying decisions of our customers. Although the gap is closing, hospital reimbursements remain higher than in-office reimbursements. Our Diagnostic Imaging segment\u2019s products are targeted to serve the hospital market. A smaller portion of our Diagnostic Services business segment operates in the hospital market.\nReductions in reimbursements could significantly impact the viability of in-office imaging performed by independent physicians. The historical decline in reimbursements in diagnostic imaging has resulted in cancellations of imaging days in our Diagnostic Services business and the delay of purchase and service decisions by our existing and prospective customers in our Diagnostic Imaging business.\nOur Diagnostic Services revenues may decline due to changes in diagnostic imaging regulations and the use of third party benefit managers by states and private payors to drive down diagnostic imaging volumes.\nNuclear medicine is a \u201cdesignated health service\u201d under the federal physician self-referral prohibition law known as the \u201cStark Law,\u201d which states that a physician may not refer designated health services to an entity with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship, unless a statutory exception applies. Our business model and service agreements are structured to enable our physician customers to meet the statutory in-office ancillary services (\u201cIOAS\u201d) exception to the Stark Law, allowing them to perform nuclear diagnostic imaging services on their patients in the convenience of their own office. From time-to-time, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and Congress have proposed to modify the IOAS to further limit or eliminate this exception. Various lobbying organizations, including the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (\u201cMedPAC\u201d), in the past have pushed for, discussed, and recommended that Congress limit the availability of the IOAS exception in order to reduce federal healthcare costs. Legislation has been introduced in prior Congresses to modify or eliminate the exception, but has not been enacted. The outcome of these efforts is uncertain at this time; however, the limitation or elimination of the IOAS exception could significantly impact our Diagnostic Services business segment as currently structured.\nOur customers who perform imaging services in their office also experience the continuing efforts by some private insurance companies to reduce healthcare expenditures by hiring radiology benefit managers to help them manage and limit imaging. The federal government has also set aside monies in the 2009 recession recovery acts to hire radiology benefit managers to provide image management services to Medicare/Medicaid and MedPAC has recommended and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has, in the past, proposed legislation requiring Medicare physicians who engage in a relatively high volume of medical imaging be required to obtain pre-authorization through a radiology benefit manager. A radiology benefit manager is an unregulated entity that performs various functions for private payors and managed care organizations. Radiology benefit manager activities can include pre-authorization for imaging procedures, setting and enforcing standards, approving which contracted physicians can perform the services, such as requiring even the most experienced and highly qualified cardiologists to obtain additional board certifications, or interfering with the financial decision of the private practitioner by requiring them to own their own imaging system and not allowing them to lease the system. The radiology benefit managers often do not provide written documentation of their decisions or an appeals process, leaving leasing physicians unable to challenge their decisions with the carrier or the state insurance department. Unregulated radiology benefit manager activities have and could continue to adversely affect our physician customers\u2019 ability to receive reimbursement, therefore impacting our customers\u2019 decision to utilize our Diagnostic Services imaging services.\nOperating results may be adversely affected by changes in the costs and availability of supplies and materials.\nManufacturing and providing service for our nuclear imaging cameras is highly dependent upon the availability of certain suppliers; thereby making us vulnerable to supply problems and price fluctuations that could harm our business. Our manufacturing process within Diagnostic Imaging, and our warranty and post-warranty camera support business, rely on a limited number of third parties to supply certain key components and manufacture our products. Alternative sources of production and supply may not be readily available or may take several months to scale-up and develop effective production processes. If a disruption in the availability of parts or in the operations of our suppliers were to occur, our ability to have gamma cameras built as well as our ability to provide support could be materially adversely affected. In certain cases, we have developed backup plans and have alternative procedures should we experience a disruption. However, if these plans are unsuccessful or if we have a single source, delays in the production and support of our gamma cameras for an extended period of time could cause a loss of revenue and/or higher production and support costs, which could significantly harm our business and results of operations.\nOur Diagnostic Services operations are highly dependent upon the availability of certain radiopharmaceuticals, thereby making us vulnerable to supply problems and price fluctuations that could harm our business. Our Diagnostic Service business involves the use of radiopharmaceuticals. There is a limited number of major nuclear reactors supplying medical radiopharmaceuticals worldwide and there is no guarantee that the reactors will remain in good repair or that our supplier will have continuing access to ample supply of our radiopharmaceutical product. If we are unable to obtain an adequate supply of the necessary radiopharmaceuticals, we may be unable to utilize our personnel and equipment through our in-office service operations, or the volume of our services could decline and our business may be adversely affected. Shortages can also cause price increases that may not be accounted for in third party reimbursement rates, thereby causing us to lose margin or require us to pass increases on to our physician customers.\nOur Construction operating results could be adversely affected by changes in the cost and availability of raw materials. Prices and availability of raw materials used to manufacture our products can change significantly due to fluctuations in supply and demand. Additionally, availability of the raw materials used to manufacture our products may be limited at times resulting in higher prices and/or the need to find alternative suppliers. Both KBS\u2019s and EdgeBuilder\u2019s major material components are dimensional lumber and wood sheet products, which include plywood and oriented strand board. Lumber costs are subject to market fluctuations. Furthermore, the cost of raw materials may also be influenced by transportation costs. It is not certain that any price increases can be passed on to our customers without affecting demand or that limited availability of materials will not impact our production capabilities. The state of the financial and housing markets may also impact our suppliers and affect the\navailability or pricing of materials. The inability of KBS or EdgeBuilder to raise the price of their products in response to increases in prices of raw materials or to maintain a proper supply of raw materials could have an adverse effect on their revenue and earnings.\nOur quarterly and annual financial results are difficult to predict and are likely to fluctuate from period to period.\nWe have historically experienced seasonality in all of our businesses, volatility due to the changing healthcare environment, the variable supply of radiopharmaceuticals, and downturns based on the changing U.S. economy. While our customers are typically obligated to pay us for imaging days to which they have committed, our contracts permit some flexibility in scheduling when services are to be performed. We cannot predict with certainty the degree to which seasonal circumstances such as the summer slowdown, winter holiday vacations, and weather conditions may affect the results of our operations. We have also experienced fluctuations in demand of our diagnostic imaging product sales due to economic conditions, capital budget availability, and other financial or business reasons, most recently the abrupt increases of quarantine restrictions and reduced demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, due to the way that customers in our target markets acquire our products, a large percentage of our products are booked during the last month of each quarterly accounting period, and often there can be a large amount in the last month of the year. As such, a delivery delay of only a few days may significantly impact quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results of operations. Moreover, the sales cycle for all of our capital products is typically lengthy, particularly in the hospital market, which may cause us to experience significant revenue fluctuations. We have also experienced fluctuations in demand in our Construction division due to economic conditions and quarantine restrictions.\nWe spend considerable time and money complying with federal and state laws, regulations, and other rules which may fluctuate based on healthcare policy, and if we are unable to fully comply with such laws, regulations, and other rules, we could face substantial penalties.\nThrough our Healthcare businesses we are directly, or indirectly through our customers, subject to extensive regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business, including: the federal Medicare and Medicaid anti-kickback laws and other Medicare laws, regulations, rules, manual provisions, and policies that prescribe requirements for coverage and payment for services performed by us and our physician customers; the federal False Claims statutes; the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended in 2009 under the HITECH Act that places direct legal obligations and higher liability on us with respect to the security and handling of personal health information; the Stark Law; the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act; federal and state radioactive materials laws; state food and drug and pharmacy laws and regulations; state laws that prohibit the practice of medicine by non-physicians and fee-splitting arrangements between physicians and non-physicians; state scope-of-practice laws; and federal rules prohibiting the mark-up of diagnostic tests to Medicare under certain circumstances. If our customers are unable or unwilling to comply with these statutes, regulations, rules, and policies, rates of our services and products could decline and our business could be harmed.\nOur Construction businesses are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations. In recent years, a number of new laws and regulations have been adopted, and there has been expanded enforcement of certain existing laws and regulations by federal, state and local agencies. These laws and regulations, and related interpretations and enforcement activity, may change as a result of a variety of factors, including political, economic or social events. Changes in, expanded enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations governing minimum wage or living wage requirements; the classification of exempt and non-exempt employees; the distinction between employees and contractors; other wage, labor or workplace regulations; healthcare; data protection and cybersecurity; the sale and pricing of some of our products; transportation; logistics; supply chain transparency; taxes; unclaimed property; energy costs and consumption; or environmental matters could increase our costs of doing business or impact our operations.\nWe maintain a compliance program to identify and correct any compliance issues and remain in compliance with all applicable laws, to train employees, to audit and monitor our operations, and to achieve other compliance goals. Like most companies with compliance programs, we occasionally discover compliance concerns. In such cases, we take responsive action, including corrective measures when necessary. There can be no assurance that our responsive actions will insulate us from liability associated with any detected compliance concerns.\nIf our past or present operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws, regulations, rules, or policies described above or the other laws or regulations to which we or our customers are subject, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from federal or state healthcare programs, or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Similarly, if our physician customers are found to be non-compliant with applicable laws, they may be subject to sanctions that could have a negative impact on us. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment, or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business, and damage our reputation. Although compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, regulations, rules, and policies, the risks cannot be entirely\neliminated. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal and state privacy, security, and fraud laws may prove costly.\nWe are subject to risks associated with self-insurance related to health benefits.\nTo help control our overall long-term costs associated with employee health benefits, we are self-insured up to certain limits for our health plans. As such, we are subject to risks associated with self-insurance of these health plan benefits. To limit our exposure, we have third party stop-loss insurance coverage for both individual and aggregate claim costs. However, we could still experience unforeseen and potentially significant fluctuations in our healthcare costs based on a higher than expected volume of claims below these stop-loss levels. These fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nA portion of our operations are located in a facility that may be at risk from fire, earthquakes, or other disasters.\nFinal assembly in our manufacturing process and significant portions of our inventory are located in a single facility in Poway, California, near known fire areas and earthquake fault zones. Future natural disasters could cause substantial delays in our operations and cause us to incur additional expenses. Although we have taken precautions to insure our facilities and continuing operations, as well as provide for offsite back-up of our information systems, this may not be adequate to cover our losses in any particular case.\nThe medical device industry is litigious, which could result in the diversion of our management\u2019s time and efforts, and require us to incur expenses and pay damages that may not be covered by our insurance.\nOur operations entail risks of claims or litigation relating to product liability, radioactive contamination, patent infringement, trade secret disclosure, warranty claims, vendor disputes, product recalls, property damage, misdiagnosis, breach of contract, personal injury, and death. Any litigation or claims against us, or claims we bring against others, may cause us to incur substantial costs, could place a significant strain on our financial resources, divert the attention of our management from our core business, and harm our reputation. We may incur significant liability in the event of any such litigation, regardless of the merit of the action. If we are unable to obtain insurance, or if our insurance is inadequate to cover claims, our cash reserves and other assets could be negatively impacted. Additionally, costs associated with maintaining our insurance could become prohibitively expensive, and our ability to become or remain profitable could be diminished.\nIf we cannot provide quality technical and applications support, we could lose customers and our business and prospects will suffer.\nThe placement of our products and the introduction of our technology at new customer sites requires the services of highly trained technical support personnel. Hiring technical support personnel is very competitive in our industry due to the limited number of people available with the necessary scientific and technical backgrounds and ability to understand our technology at a technical level. If we are unable to attract, train or retain the number of highly qualified technical services personnel that our business needs, our business and prospects will suffer.\nOur long-term results depend upon our ability to improve existing products and services and develop, introduce, and market new products and services successfully.\nOur business is dependent on the continued improvement of our existing products and services and our development of new products and services utilizing our current or other potential future technology. As we introduce new products and services or refine, improve or upgrade versions of existing products and services, we cannot predict the level of market acceptance or the amount of market share these products and services will achieve, if any. We cannot assure you that we will not experience material delays in the introduction of new products or services in the future.\nWe generally sell our products and services in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product introductions and changing industry standards. If we do not develop new products and services and product enhancements based on technological innovation on a timely basis, our products and services may become obsolete over time and our revenues, cash flow, profitability and competitive position may suffer. Even if we successfully innovate and develop new products, services and product enhancements, we may incur substantial costs in doing so, and our profitability may suffer.\nWe may face risks associated with launching new products and services. If we encounter development or manufacturing challenges or discover errors during our product development cycle, the product launch dates of new products and services may be delayed. The expenses or losses associated with unsuccessful product development or launch activities or lack of market acceptance of our new products and services could adversely affect our business or financial condition.\nOur ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology through patents and other means is uncertain.\nWe rely on patent protection as well as trademark, copyright, trade secret and other intellectual property rights protection and contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technologies, all of which provide limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. Our success depends, in part, on our\nability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies used in our products. If we fail to protect and/or maintain our intellectual property, third parties may be able to compete more effectively against us, we may lose our technological or competitive advantage, and/or we may incur substantial litigation costs in our attempts to recover or restrict use of our intellectual property.\nWe do not have any pending patent applications. We cannot assure investors that we will continue to innovate and file new patent applications, or that if filed any future patent applications will result in granted patents. Further, we cannot predict how long it will take for such patents to issue, if at all. It is possible that, for any of our patents that have issued or that may issue in the future, our competitors may design their products around our patented technologies. Further, we cannot assure investors that other parties will not challenge any patents granted to us, or that courts or regulatory agencies will hold our patents to be valid, enforceable, and/or infringed. We cannot guarantee investors that we will be successful in defending challenges made against our patents and patent applications. Any successful third-party challenge or challenges to our patents could result in the unenforceability or invalidity of such patents, or such patents being interpreted narrowly and/or in a manner adverse to our interests. Our ability to establish or maintain a technological or competitive advantage over our competitors and/or market entrants may be diminished because of these uncertainties. For these and other reasons, our intellectual property may not provide us with any competitive advantage.\nTo the extent our intellectual property offers inadequate protection, or is found to be invalid or unenforceable, we would be exposed to a greater risk of direct or indirect competition. If our intellectual property does not provide adequate coverage of our competitors\u2019 products, our competitive position could be adversely affected, as could our business.\nThe measures that we use to protect the security of our intellectual property and other proprietary rights may not be adequate, which could result in the loss of legal protection for, and thereby diminish the value of, such intellectual property and other rights or we may need to enter into costly license agreements in the future.\nOther than pursuing patents on our technology, we also rely upon trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and unfair competition laws, as well as license agreements and other contractual provisions, to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. Despite these measures, any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or misappropriated. In addition, we take steps to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology by entering into confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, corporate partners and, when needed, our advisors. Such agreements may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and/or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure or other breaches of the agreements, and we may not be able to prevent such unauthorized disclosure. Moreover, if a party having an agreement with us has an overlapping or conflicting obligation to a third party, our rights in and to certain intellectual property could be undermined. Monitoring unauthorized and inadvertent disclosure is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to prevent such disclosure are, or will be, adequate. If we were to enforce a claim that a third party had illegally obtained and was using our trade secrets, it would be expensive and time consuming, the outcome would be unpredictable, and any remedy may be inadequate.\nIf we are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, it would be costly and time consuming, and an unfavorable outcome in that litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur success also depends on our ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell our products and perform our services without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Numerous U.S. issued patents and pending patent applications owned by third parties exist in the fields in which we are developing products and services. As part of a business strategy to impede our successful commercialization and entry into new markets, competitors may allege that our products and/or services infringe their intellectual property rights.\nWe could incur substantial costs and divert the attention of our management and technical personnel in defending ourselves against claims of infringement made by third parties. Any adverse ruling by a court or administrative body, or perception of an adverse ruling, may have a material adverse impact on our ability to conduct our business and our finances. Moreover, third parties making claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive relief against us, which could block our ability to offer one or more products or services and could result in a substantial award of damages against us. Intellectual property litigation can be very expensive, and we may not have the financial means to defend ourselves.\nBecause patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be pending applications, some of which are unknown to us, that may result in issued patents upon which our products or proprietary technologies may infringe. Moreover, we may fail to identify issued patents of relevance or incorrectly conclude that an issued patent is invalid or not infringed by our technology or any of our products.\nOur issued patents could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court, at the USPTO or other administrative agency, or in other lawsuits which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nAny patents we have obtained or do obtain may be challenged by re-examination or otherwise invalidated or eventually found unenforceable. Both the patent application process and the process of managing patent disputes can be time consuming and expensive. If we were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent related to one of our products or services, the defendant in such litigation could counterclaim that our patent is invalid and/or unenforceable. Third parties may also raise similar claims before the USPTO even outside the context of litigation. The outcome is unpredictable following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that no invalidating prior art existed of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. These assertions may also be based on information known to us or the USPTO. If a defendant or third party were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the claims of the challenged patent. Such a loss of patent protection would or could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nCompetitors may attempt to challenge or invalidate our patents, or may be able to design alternative techniques or devices that avoid infringement of our patents that have issued or that may issue in the future, or develop products with functionalities that are comparable to ours. In the event a competitor infringes upon our patent or other intellectual property rights, litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend our patents against challenge, even if successful, could be expensive and time consuming and could require significant time and attention from our management. We may not have sufficient resources to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend our patents against challenges from others.\nAn adverse result in any such litigation proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, being found to be unenforceable, and/or being interpreted narrowly and could impact the validity or enforceability positions of our other patents. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, an adverse outcome in such litigation or proceedings may expose us to loss of our proprietary position, expose us to significant liabilities, or require us to seek licenses that may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.\nWe may make financial investments in other businesses that may lose value.\nAs we look for the best ways to deploy our capital and maximize our returns for our businesses and stockholders, we may make financial investments in other businesses or processes for purposes of enhancing our supply chain, creating financial returns, strategic developments, or other purposes. These investments may be speculative in nature, and there is no guarantee that we will experience a financial return and we may lose our entire principal balance if not successful.\nOur goodwill and other long-lived assets are subject to potential impairment that could negatively impact our earnings.\nA significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other long-lived assets, the carrying value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired. At December 31, 2021, goodwill and net intangible assets represented $21.1 million, or 31.0% of our total assets, and at December 31, 2020, goodwill and net intangible assets represented $26.4 million, or 29.6% of our total assets. In addition, net property and equipment assets totaled $8.9 million and $9.8 million, or 13.1% and 10.9%, respectively, of our total assets at those dates. If actual results differ from the assumptions and estimates used in our goodwill and long-lived asset valuation calculations, we could incur impairment charges, which could negatively impact our earnings.\nWe review our reporting units for potential goodwill impairment annually or more often if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. In addition, we test the recoverability of long-lived assets if events or circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be recoverable. Recoverability of long-lived assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amounts to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. We conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions, as well as future expectations. There are numerous risks that may cause the fair value of a reporting unit to fall below its carrying amount and/or the value of long-lived assets to not be recoverable, which could lead to the measurement and recognition of goodwill and/or long-lived asset impairment. These risks include, but are not limited to, significant negative variances between actual and expected financial results, lowered expectations of future financial results, failure to realize anticipated synergies from acquisitions, adverse changes in the business climate, and the loss of key personnel. If we are not able to achieve projected performance levels, future impairments could be possible, which could negatively impact our earnings.\nWe recorded an impairment loss of $3.4 million associated with the impairment assessment of the KBS reporting unit as of December 31, 2021 and an impairment loss of $0.4 million associated with the impairment assessment of the EBGL reporting unit as of December 31, 2020. See Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 7. Goodwill, within the notes to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding goodwill and long-lived assets.\nIf KBS is unable to maintain or establish its relationships with independent dealers and contractors who sell its homes, KBS revenue could decline.\nKBS sells residential homes through a network of independent dealers and contractors. As is common in the modular home industry, KBS\u2019s independent dealers may also sell homes produced by competing manufacturers and can cancel their relationships with KBS on short notice. In addition, these dealers may not remain financially solvent, as they are subject to industry, economic, demographic and seasonal trends similar to those faced by KBS. If KBS is not able to maintain good relationships with its dealers and contractors or establish relationships with new solvent dealers or contractors, KBS\u2019s revenue could decline.\nDue to the nature of our business, many of our expenses are fixed costs and if there are decreases in demand for products, it may adversely affect operating results.\nMany of our expenses, particularly those relating to properties, capital equipment, and certain manufacturing overhead items, are fixed in the short term. Reduced demand for products causes fixed production costs to be allocated across reduced production volumes, which may adversely affect gross margins and profitability.\nDue to the nature of the work we and our subsidiaries perform, we may be subject to significant liability claims and disputes.\nWe and our wholly owned subsidiaries engage in services that can result in substantial injury or damages that may expose us to legal proceedings, investigations and disputes. For example, in the ordinary course of our business, we may be involved in legal disputes regarding personal injury and wrongful death claims, employee or labor disputes, professional liability claims, and general commercial disputes, as well as other claims. Lone Star Value Management, LLC, now a liquidated entity, previously was an exempt reporting advisor and subject to certain regulations which at times may prompt investigations by the SEC or other regulatory bodies into proper compliance therewith. An unfavorable legal ruling against us or our subsidiaries could result in substantial monetary damages. Although we have adopted a range of insurance, risk management, safety, and risk avoidance programs designed to reduce potential liabilities, there can be no assurance that such programs will protect us fully from all risks and liabilities. If we sustain liabilities that exceed our insurance coverage or for which we are not insured, it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness\nOn March 29, 2019, we and certain of the Healthcare subsidiaries entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with SNB (the \u201cSNB Loan Agreement\u201d). The SNB Loan Agreement is a five-year revolving credit facility (maturing in March 2024), which, as amended, has a maximum credit amount of $20 million (the \u201cSNB Credit Facility\u201d). As of December 31, 2021, our floating rate under this facility was 2.60%. On January 31, 2020, we and certain of our Investments subsidiaries entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Gerber (as amended, the \u201cStar Loan Agreement\u201d), which provides for a credit facility with borrowing availability of up to $2.5 million, bearing interest at the prime rate plus 3.5% per annum, and matures on January 1, 2025, unless terminated in accordance with the terms therein (the \u201cStar Loan\u201d). On January 31, 2020, we and certain of our Construction subsidiaries entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Gerber (the \u201cEdgeBuilder Loan Agreement\u201d), which provides for a credit facility with borrowing availability of up to $3.0 million, bearing interest at the prime rate plus 2.75% per annum, and matures on January 1, 2023, subject to annual automatic extensions (the \u201cEdgeBuilder Loan\u201d). The credit facility under the Loan and Security Agreement, dated February 23, 2016, by and among us, KBS, ATRM, and Gerber (as amended, the \u201cKBS Loan Agreement\u201d) provides for a revolving credit facility of up to $4.0 million, bearing interest at the prime rate plus 2.75%, that matures on February 22, 2023, subject to automatic extension for an additional year unless terminated. The SNB Loan Agreement, Star Loan Agreement, EdgeBuilder Loan Agreement and KBS Loan Agreement are collectively referred to as the \u201cCompany Loan Agreements.\u201d\nOur indebtedness could restrict our operations and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions.\nOur indebtedness could have important consequences for us and our stockholders. For example, the SNB Loan Agreement requires a balloon payment at the termination of the facility in March 2024, which payment may require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to this future payment if we feel we cannot be successful in our ability to refinance in the future, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, and acquisitions, and for other general corporate purposes. In addition, our indebtedness could:\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and competitive pressures in our industry;\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; and\n\u2022limit our ability to borrow additional funds on terms that are acceptable to us or at all.\nThe Company Loan Agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictive covenants that restrict our operating flexibility and require that we maintain specified financial ratios. If we cannot comply with these covenants, we may be in default under one or more of the Company Loan Agreements.\nThe Company Loan Agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions and limitations on our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. The Company Loan Agreements contain affirmative and negative covenants that limit and restrict, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022incur additional debt;\n\u2022sell assets;\n\u2022incur liens or other encumbrances;\n\u2022make certain restricted payments and investments;\n\u2022acquire other businesses; and\n\u2022merge or consolidate.\nThe SNB Loan Agreement limits our ability to pay dividends and to redeem our equity securities if such dividend or redemption would result in our non-compliance with the financial covenants in the SNB Loan Agreement, there is insufficient borrowing availability under the SNB Loan Agreement, or if there is a default or event of default under the SNB Loan Agreement that has occurred and is continuing. In addition, the Company Loan Agreements include explicit restrictions on the payment of dividends and distributions to us, which could limit our ability to pay dividends. We may, therefore be required to reduce or eliminate our dividends, if any, including on our preferred stock (if any outstanding), and/or may be unable to redeem shares of our preferred stock (if any outstanding) until compliance with such financial covenants can be met.\nThe Company Loan Agreements contain various financial covenants that, going forward, we or our subsidiaries may not have the ability to meet. The Company Loan Agreements also contain various other affirmative and negative covenants regarding, among other things, the performance of our business, capital allocation decisions made by us and our subsidiaries, or events beyond our control.\nOur failure to comply with our covenants and other obligations under the Company Loan Agreements may result in an event of default thereunder. A default, if not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of our indebtedness. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds available to pay the accelerated indebtedness (together with accrued interest and fees), or that we will have the ability to refinance the accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us or at all. This could have serious consequences to our financial condition, operating results, and business, and could cause us to become insolvent or enter bankruptcy proceedings, and stockholders may lose all or a portion of their investment because of the priority of the claims of our creditors on our assets.\nSubstantially all of our assets (including the assets of our subsidiaries) have been pledged to lenders as security for our indebtedness under the Company Loan Agreements.\nThe Company Loan Agreements are secured by a first-priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of us and our subsidiaries and a pledge of all shares and equity interests of our subsidiaries. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default under any Company Loan Agreement, the applicable lender may, among other things, declare the loans and all other obligations thereunder immediately due and payable and may, in certain instances, increase the interest rate at which loans and obligations bear interest. The exercise by a lender of remedies provided under the applicable Company Loan Agreement in the event of a default thereunder may have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, financial condition and results of operations of the applicable borrowers and/or us and could cause such borrowers and/or us to become bankrupt or insolvent. Our obligations and the obligations of our various subsidiaries under the Company Loan Agreements are guaranteed by our other subsidiaries and/or us directly. In the event of any bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization, or similar proceeding against us, the assets that are pledged as collateral securing any unpaid amounts under the applicable Company Loan Agreement must first be used to pay such amounts, as well as any other obligation secured by the pledged assets, in full, before making any distributions to our stockholders. In the event of any of the foregoing, our stockholders could lose all or a part of their investment.\nThe inability of our Company, KBS, EdgeBuilder or any of our other subsidiaries to comply with applicable financial covenants under the Company Loan Agreements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our last test date, KBS was not in compliance with the bi-annual financial covenants under the KBS Loan Agreement, which required no net annual post-tax loss and certain minimum leverage ratios as of the test date. We obtained waivers from Gerber, our lender, for these financial covenant violations. While Gerber has historically provided us with timely waivers, there can be no assurance that we will be able to receive waivers for any financial covenant violations in the future, or that we will comply with all financial covenants in the future.\nIf we or any of our subsidiaries fail to comply with any applicable financial covenants under the Company Loan Agreements to which we are a party, or if there is otherwise an event of default under the Company Loan Agreements by a borrower, the borrowers\u2019 obligations thereunder may (subject to any applicable cure periods) become immediately due and payable and the applicable lender(s) may demand the repayment of the credit facilities amount outstanding and any unpaid interest thereon.\nIf we are unable to generate or borrow sufficient cash to make payments on our indebtedness, our financial condition would be materially harmed, our business could fail, and stockholders may lose all of their investment.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance, which will be affected by economic, financial, competitive, business, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. If we are unable to meet our debt obligations or fund our other liquidity needs, we may need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity or sell certain of our assets. We cannot assure you that we will be able to restructure or refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, which could cause us to default on our debt obligations and impair our liquidity. Any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations.\nIncreases in interest rates could adversely affect our results from operations and financial condition.\nThe SNB Loan Agreement and Star Loan Agreement allow for amounts borrowed thereunder to be subject to a floating interest rate which may change with market interest rates. An increase in prevailing interest rates would have an effect on the interest rates charged on our variable rate debt, which rise and fall upon changes in interest rates. If prevailing interest rates or other factors result in higher interest rates, the increased interest expense would adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock and our Company Preferred Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile, and the value of your investment could decline significantly.\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and we expect it to continue to be, volatile. The prices at which our shares of common stock trade depend upon a number of factors, including our historical and anticipated operating results, our financial situation, announcements of new products by us or our competitors, history of timely dividend payments, our ability or inability to raise the additional capital we may need and the terms on which we raise it, and general market and economic conditions. Some of these factors are beyond our control. Broad market fluctuations may lower the market price of our common stock and affect the volume of trading in our stock, regardless of our financial condition, results of operations, business, or prospects. It is impossible to assure you that the market price of our shares of common stock will not fall in the future.\nOur common stock has a low trading volume and shares available under our equity compensation plans could affect the trading price of our common stock.\nOur common stock historically has had a low trading volume. Any significant sales of our common stock may cause volatility in our stock price. We also have registered shares of common stock that we may issue under our employee benefit plans or from our treasury stock. Accordingly, these shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to restrictions under the securities laws. If any of these stockholders, or other selling stockholders, cause a large number of securities to be sold in the public market without a corresponding demand, the sales could reduce the trading price of our common stock. One or more stockholders holding a significant amount of our common stock might be able to significantly influence matters requiring approval by our stockholders, possibly including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions.\nA possible \u201cshort squeeze\u201d due to a sudden increase in demand of our common stock that largely exceeds supply may lead to price volatility in our common stock.\nInvestors may purchase our common stock to hedge existing exposure in our common stock or to speculate on the price of our common stock. Speculation on the price of our common stock may involve long and short exposures. To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares of our common stock available for purchase in the open market, investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase our common stock for delivery to lenders of our common stock. Those repurchases may in turn, dramatically increase the price of our common stock until investors with short exposure are able to purchase additional common shares to cover their short position. This is often referred to as a \u201cshort squeeze.\u201d A short squeeze could lead to volatile price movements in our common stock that are not directly correlated to the performance or prospects of our Company and once investors purchase the shares of common stock necessary to cover their short position the price of our common stock may decline.\nPayment of dividends on our common stock is prohibited unless we have declared and paid (or set apart for payment) full accumulated dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock, which also has a significant liquidation value.\nUnless full cumulative dividends on our preferred stock have been, or contemporaneously are, declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof is set apart for payment for all past dividend periods, no dividends (other than a dividend in shares of common stock or other shares of stock ranking junior to the Series A Preferred Stock (as defined herein) as to dividends and upon liquidation) may be declared and paid or declared and set apart for payment on our common stock, nor may any shares of common stock be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any consideration by us. To the extent dividends are not paid on our preferred stock, cumulative dividends accrue as part of the liquidation value of our preferred stock, which has a liquidation value of $10.00 per share at issuance. Dividends on our preferred stock are payable out of amounts legally available therefor at a rate equal to 10.0% per annum per $10.00 of stated liquidation preference per share, or $1.00 per share of our preferred stock per year. Dividends on our preferred stock are only payable in cash. As of December 31, 2021, there were 1,915,637 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock outstanding.\nIf we fail to pay dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock for six or more consecutive quarters, holders of our Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to elect two additional directors to our board of directors.\nTo the extent dividends are not paid on the Series A Preferred Stock in accordance with their terms, cumulative dividends will accrue as part of the liquidation value of the Series A Preferred Stock. Whenever dividends on any shares of Series A Preferred Stock are in arrears for six or more consecutive quarters, then the holders of those shares together with the holders of all other series of preferred stock equal in rank with the Series A Preferred Stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, will be entitled to vote separately as a class for the election of a total of two additional directors to our board of directors. Holders of our common stock will not be entitled to vote no such additional directors.\nWe may not be able to redeem our Series A Preferred Stock upon a Change of Control Triggering Event.\nUpon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event (as such term is defined in the Certificate of Designations of our Series A Preferred Stock), unless we have exercised our option to redeem our preferred stock after September 10, 2024, each holder of our preferred stock will have the right to require us to redeem all or any part of such holder\u2019s preferred stock at a price equal to the liquidation preference of $10.00 per share, plus an amount equal to any accumulated and unpaid dividends up to but excluding the date of payment, but without interest. If we experience a Change of Control Triggering Event, there can be no assurance that we would have sufficient financial resources available to satisfy our obligations to redeem our preferred stock and any indebtedness that may be required to be repaid or repurchased as a result of such event. In addition, we may be unable to redeem our preferred stock upon a Change of Control Triggering Event if such redemption would result in our non-compliance with the financial covenants in the Company Loan Agreements. Our failure to redeem our preferred stock could have material adverse consequences for us and the holders of our preferred stock.\nAs a smaller reporting company, we are subject to scaled disclosure requirements that may make it more challenging for investors to analyze and compare our results of operations and financial prospects.\nCurrently, we are a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. As a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d we are able to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures in our filings and have certain other decreased disclosure obligations in our filings with the SEC, including being required to provide only two years of audited financial statements in annual reports. Consequently, it may be more challenging for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects.\nFurthermore, we are a non-accelerated filer as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, and, as such, are not required to provide an auditor attestation of management\u2019s assessment of internal control over financial reporting, which is generally required for SEC reporting companies under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Because we are not required to, and have not, had our auditor provide an attestation of our management\u2019s assessment of internal control over financial reporting, a material weakness in internal controls may remain undetected for a longer period.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our stock, the price and trading volume of our securities could decline.\nThe trading market for our securities will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. We currently have two securities and industry analysts providing research coverage. In the event if any of the analysts who cover us issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding us, our business model, our intellectual property or our stock performance, or if our clinical trials and operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts, the price of our securities would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the price or trading volume of our securities to decline\nThe protective amendment contained in our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which is intended to help preserve the value of certain income tax assets, primarily tax net operating loss carryforwards, may have unintended negative effects.\nPursuant to Sections 382 and 383 of the Code, use of our NOLs may be limited by an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined under Section 382 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. In order to protect our significant NOLs, we filed an amendment to our certificate of incorporation (the \u201cRestated Certificate of Incorporation\u201d) (as amended and extended, the \u201cProtective Amendment\u201d) with the Delaware Secretary of State on May 5, 2015. The Protective Amendment was approved by our stockholders at our 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on October 21, 2021.\nThe Protective Amendment is designed to assist us in protecting the long-term value of our accumulated NOLs by limiting certain transfers of our common stock. The Protective Amendment\u2019s transfer restrictions generally restrict any direct or indirect transfers of the common stock if the effect would be to increase the direct or indirect ownership of the common stock by any person from less than 4.99% to 4.99% or more of the common stock, or increase the percentage of the common stock owned directly or indirectly by a person owning or deemed to own 4.99% or more of the common stock. Any direct or indirect transfer attempted in violation of the Protective Amendment will be void as of the date of the prohibited transfer as to the purported transferee.\nThe Protective Amendment also requires any person attempting to become a holder of 4.99% or more of our common stock to seek the approval of our board of directors. This may have an unintended \u201canti-takeover\u201d effect because our board of directors may be able to prevent any future takeover. Similarly, any limits on the amount of stock that a stockholder may own could have the effect of making it more difficult for stockholders to replace current management. Additionally, because the Protective Amendment may have the effect of restricting a stockholder\u2019s ability to dispose of or acquire our common stock, the liquidity and market value of our common stock might suffer.\nOur stockholder rights plan, or \u201cpoison pill,\u201d includes terms and conditions which could discourage a takeover or other transaction that stockholders may consider favorable.\nOn June 2, 2021, stockholders of record at the close of business on that date received a dividend of one right (a \u201cRight\u201d) for each outstanding share of common stock. Each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase one one-thousandth of a share of our Series C Participating Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries C Preferred Stock\u201d, and together with the Series A Preferred Stock, the \u201cCompany Preferred Stock\u201d), at a price of $12.00 per one-thousandth of a share of Series C Preferred Stock, subject to adjustment (the \u201cExercise Price\u201d). The Rights are not exercisable until the Distribution Date referred to below. The description and terms of the Rights are set forth in the Rights Agreement, which has previously been filed as an exhibit to our public reports.\nThe Rights Agreement imposes a significant penalty upon any person or group that acquires 4.99% or more (but less than 50%) of our then-outstanding common stock without the prior approval of our board of directors. A person or group that acquires shares of our common stock in excess of the applicable threshold, subject to certain limited exceptions, is called an \u201cAcquiring Person.\u201d Any rights held by an Acquiring Person are void and may not be exercised. The Rights will not be exercisable until the earlier of ten days after a public announcement by us that a person or group has become an Acquiring Person and ten business days (or a later date determined by our board of directors) after a person or group begins a tender or an exchange offer that, if completed, would result in that person or group becoming an acquiring person. On the date (if any) that the Rights become exercisable (the \u201cDistribution Date\u201d), each Right would allow its holder to purchase one one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock for a purchase price of $12.00. In addition, if a person or group becomes an Acquiring Person after the Distribution Date or already is an Acquiring Person and acquires more shares after the Distribution Date, all holders of Rights, except the Acquiring Person, may exercise their rights to purchase a number of shares of the common stock (in lieu of preferred stock) with a market value of twice the Exercise Price, upon payment of the purchase price.\nThe Rights will expire on the earliest of (i) June 2, 2024, or such earlier date as of which our board of directors determines that the Rights Agreement is no longer necessary for the preservation of our tax assets, (ii) the time at which the rights are redeemed, (iii) the time at which the rights are exchanged, (iv) the effective time of the repeal of Section 382 of the Code or any successor statute if our board of directors determines that the Rights Agreement is no longer necessary for the preservation of our tax assets, and (v) the first day of our taxable year in which our board determines that no NOLs or other tax assets may be carried forward.\nThe Rights have certain anti-takeover effects, including potentially discouraging a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable. The Rights will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by the board of directors.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law may prevent or delay removal of current management or a change in control.\nOur Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws contain provisions that may delay or prevent a change in control, discourage bids at a premium over the market price of our common stock, and adversely affect the market price of our common\nstock and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock. In addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Delaware corporate law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. In general, Section 203 prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder unless certain specific requirements are met as set forth in Section 203. These provisions, alone or together, could have the effect of deterring or delaying changes in incumbent management, proxy contests or changes in control.\nWe expect to be limited in our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards to reduce our future tax liability as a result of our recent Offering.\nUnder Section 382 of the Code, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change income may be limited. We expect that our recent Offering, alone or in conjunction with other changes in our stock ownership that we cannot control, may result in an \u201cownership change.\u201d We may also experience ownership changes in the future as a result of strategic transactions or partnerships, equity offerings and other shifts in our stock ownership. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change NOL carryforwards and other deferred tax assets to offset U.S. federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. In addition, similar limitations may apply at the state level and there may be periods during which the use of NOL carryforwards is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed.\nRisks Related to Our Material Weakness and Restatements\nMaterial weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could have a significant adverse effect on our business and the price of our common stock.\nAs a public reporting company, we are subject to the rules and regulations established from time to time by the SEC. These rules and regulations require, among other things, that we have, and periodically evaluate, disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules, regulations and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow decisions regarding required disclosure. Reporting obligations as a public company are likely to continue to burden our financial and management systems, processes and controls, as well as our personnel.\nIn addition, as a public company, we are required to document and test our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act so that our management can certify as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nIn connection with the preparation of our financial statements for 2021, our management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as we do not have a sufficient complement of accounting resources to address complex accounting matters across all operating entities and to allow timely completion of financial reporting and accounting activities, including sufficiently precise management review controls. The material weakness did not result in any material identified misstatements to the financial statements, and there were no material changes to previously released financial results.", "PERMNO": 90223, "SIC": 8071, "TIC": "DRAD"}
