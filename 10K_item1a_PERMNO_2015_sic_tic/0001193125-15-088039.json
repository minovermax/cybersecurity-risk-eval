{"cik": "315545", "company": "PROVECTUS BIOPHARMACEUTICALS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-12", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nOur business and its future performance may be affected by various factors, the most significant of which are discussed below.\nWe are a development stage company, have no prescription drug products approved for commercial sale, have incurred substantial losses, and expect to incur substantial losses and negative operating cash flow for the foreseeable future.\nOur company is a development stage company that has no prescription drug products approved for commercial sale. We have never generated any substantial revenues and may never achieve substantial revenues or profitability. As of December 31, 2014, we have incurred net losses of $156 million in the aggregate since inception in January 2002. We expect to incur substantial losses and negative operating cash flow for the foreseeable future. We may never achieve or maintain profitability, even if we succeed in developing and commercializing one or more of our prescription drug candidates, OTC products, or non-core technologies. We also expect to continue to incur significant operating expenditures and anticipate that our operating and capital expenses may increase substantially in the foreseeable future as we:\n\u2022\ncontinue to develop and seek regulatory approval for our prescription drug candidates PV-10 and PH-10;\n\u2022\nseek licensure of PV-10, PH-10, our OTC products, and our other non-core technologies;\n\u2022\nfurther develop our non-core technologies;\n\u2022\nimplement additional internal systems and infrastructure; and\n\u2022\nhire additional personnel.\nWe also expect to experience negative operating cash flow for the foreseeable future as we fund our operating losses and any future capital expenditures. As a result, we will need to generate significant revenues in order to achieve and maintain profitability. We may not be able to generate these revenues or achieve profitability in the future. Our failure to achieve or maintain profitability could negatively impact the value of our common stock.\nAll of our existing prescription drug candidates are in early stages of development. It may be several years, if ever, until we have a prescription drug product available for commercial resale. If we do not successfully develop and license or commercialize our prescription drug candidates, or sell or license our OTC products or non-core technologies, we will not achieve revenues or profitability in the foreseeable future, if at all. If we are unable to generate revenues or achieve profitability, we may be unable to continue our operations.\nWe may need additional capital to conduct our operations and commercialize and/or further develop our prescription drug candidates in 2016 and beyond, and our ability to obtain the necessary funding is uncertain.\nWe estimate that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to fund our current and planned operations until 2016. However, we may need additional capital in 2016 and beyond as we continue to develop and seek commercialization of our prescription drug candidates. We intend to proceed as rapidly as possible with licensure of PH-10 on the basis of our expanding phase 2 atopic dermatitis and psoriasis results, which continue to be developed. We potentially may license PV-10\ndepending on the timing for the optimal deal structure for our stockholders. We are also focusing on PV-10 geographic licensing and partnering opportunities in such countries as China and India. We are also focusing on potential co-development partnering opportunities with combination of PV-10 and immune checkpoint blockade or systemic immunotherapy agents. We intend to also proceed as rapidly as possible with the sale or licensure of our OTC products and other non-core technologies. Although we believe that there is a reasonable basis for our expectation that we will become profitable due to both the licensure of PH-10 and PV-10, and the sale or licensure of our OTC products and non-core technologies, we cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve, or maintain, a level of profitability sufficient to meet our operating expenses.\nWe have based our estimate of capital needs on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we cannot assure you that estimates and assumptions will remain unchanged. For example, we are currently assuming that we will continue to operate without any significant staff or other resources expansion. We intend to acquire additional funding through public or private equity or debt financings or other financing sources that may be available. Additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. As discussed in more detail below, additional equity financing could result in significant dilution to stockholders. Further, in the event that additional funds are obtained through licensing or other arrangements, these arrangements may require us to relinquish rights to some of our products, product candidates, and technologies that we would otherwise seek to develop and commercialize ourselves. If sufficient capital is not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of our programs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and may impair the value of our patents and other intangible assets.\nOur prescription drug candidates are at an intermediary stage of development and may never obtain U.S. or international regulatory approvals required for us to commercialize our prescription drug candidates.\nWe will need approval of the FDA to commercialize our prescription drug candidates in the U.S. and approvals from the FDA equivalent regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions to commercialize our prescription drug candidates in those jurisdictions.\nWe are continuing to pursue clinical development of our most advanced prescription drug candidates, PV-10 and PH-10, for use as treatments for specific conditions. The continued and further development of these prescription drug candidates will require significant additional research, formulation and manufacture development, and pre-clinical and extensive clinical testing prior to their regulatory approval and commercialization. Pre-clinical and clinical studies of our prescription drug candidates may not demonstrate the safety and efficacy necessary to obtain regulatory approvals. Pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after experiencing promising results in earlier trials. Pharmaceutical drug and medical device products that appear to be promising at early stages of development may not reach the market or be marketed successfully for a number of reasons, including the following:\n\u2022\na product may be found to be ineffective or have harmful side effects during subsequent pre-clinical testing or clinical trials,\n\u2022\na product may fail to receive necessary regulatory clearance,\n\u2022\na product may be too difficult to manufacture on a large scale,\n\u2022\na product may be too expensive to manufacture or market,\n\u2022\na product may not achieve broad market acceptance,\n\u2022\nothers may hold proprietary rights that will prevent a product from being marketed, and\n\u2022\nothers may market equivalent or superior products.\nSatisfaction of the FDA\u2019s regulatory requirements typically takes many years, depends upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidate and requires substantial resources for research, development and testing. We cannot predict whether our research and clinical approaches will result in drugs that the FDA considers safe for humans and effective for indicated uses. The FDA has substantial discretion in the drug approval process and may require us to conduct additional nonclinical and clinical testing or to perform post-marketing studies. The approval process may also be delayed by changes in government regulation, future legislation or administrative action or changes in FDA policy that occur prior to or during our regulatory review. Delays in obtaining regulatory approvals may:\n\u2022\ndelay commercialization of, and our ability to derive product revenues from, our product candidates;\n\u2022\nimpose costly procedures on us; and\n\u2022\ndiminish any competitive advantages that we may otherwise enjoy.\nWe do not expect any prescription drug and other product candidates that we are developing to be commercially available without a partner. Our research and product development efforts may not be successfully completed and may not result in any successfully commercialized products. Further, after commercial introduction of a new product, discovery of problems through adverse event reporting could result in restrictions on the product, including withdrawal from the market and, in certain cases, civil or criminal penalties.\nEven if we comply with all FDA requests, we cannot be sure that we will ever obtain regulatory clearance for any of our prescription drug or other product candidates. Failure to obtain FDA approval of any of our product candidates will severely undermine our business by reducing our number of salable products and, therefore, corresponding product revenues.\nIn foreign jurisdictions, we must receive approval from the appropriate regulatory authorities before we can commercialize our drugs. Foreign regulatory approval processes generally include all of the risks associated with the FDA approval procedures described above.\nWe are subject to securities class action lawsuits that could adversely affect our business. This litigation, and potential similar or related litigation, could result in substantial damages and may divert management\u2019s time and attention from our business.\nBeginning on May 27, 2014, three putative securities class action lawsuits (the \u201cFederal Class Actions\u201d) were commenced in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee against us, and certain of our officers and directors, alleging violations by the defendants of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. The Federal Class Actions allege, among other things, that the defendants made false and materially misleading statements and failed to disclose material information regarding our application to the FDA for BTD of PV-10.\nOn July 9, 2014, the Company and the Federal Class Action plaintiffs filed joint motions to consolidate the cases and transfer them to United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee. By order dated July 16, 2014, the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee consolidated the Federal Class Actions and transferred them to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee. On November 26, 2014, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee (the \u201cCourt\u201d) entered an order appointing Fawwaz Hamati as the Lead Plaintiff in the Securities Litigation, with the Law Firm of Glancy Binkow & Goldberg, LLP as counsel to Lead Plaintiff. On February 3, 2015, the Court entered an order compelling the Lead Plaintiff to file a consolidated amended complaint within 60 days of entry of the order. As of March 4, 2015, the Lead Plaintiff has yet to file a consolidated amended complaint.\nIn addition, on June 4, 2014, a shareholder derivative lawsuit captioned Hurtado v. Provectus Biopharmaceuticals, Inc., et al. was filed derivatively on behalf of the Company against H. Craig Dees, Timothy C. Scott, Jan E. Koe, Kelly M. McMasters, and Alfred E. Smith, IV (collectively, the \u201cIndividual Defendants\u201d), and against the Company as a nominal defendant in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee (the \u201cHurtado Shareholder Derivative Lawsuit\u201d). The Hurtado Shareholder Derivative Lawsuit alleges (i) breach of fiduciary duties, and (ii) abuse of control, both claims based on the Plaintiff\u2019s allegations that the Individual Defendants recklessly permitted the Company to disclose false and misleading information and failed to implement adequate controls and procedures to ensure the accuracy of the Company\u2019s disclosures.\nOn July 25, 2014, the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee entered an order transferring the Hurtado Shareholder Derivative Lawsuit to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee and, in light of the pending Federal Class Actions, relieving the Individual Defendants from responding to the complaint in the Hurtado Shareholder Derivative Lawsuit pending further order from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee.\nOn October 24, 2014, Paul Montiminy brought a shareholder derivative complaint on behalf of the Company in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee (the \u201cMontiminy Shareholder Derivative Lawsuit\u201d) against the Individual Defendants. Like the Hurtado Shareholder Derivative Lawsuit, the Montiminy Shareholder Derivative Lawsuit alleges (i) breach of fiduciary duties and (ii) gross mismanagement of the assets and business of the Company, both claims based on Mr. Montiminy\u2019s allegations that the Individual Defendants recklessly permitted the Company to make certain false and misleading disclosures regarding the likelihood that PV-10 would qualify for BTD.\nOn December 29, 2014, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee (the \u201cCourt\u201d) entered an order consolidating the Hurtado Shareholder Derivative Lawsuit and the Montiminy Derivative Lawsuit. On February 25, 2015, the parties submitted a proposed agreed order staying the Hurtado and Montiminy Shareholder Derivative Lawsuits until the Court issues a ruling on the anticipated motion to dismiss the amended consolidated complaint to be filed in the Securities Litigation. As of March 4, 2015, the Court has not yet entered the proposed agreed order staying the Hurtado and Montiminy Shareholder Derivative Lawsuits.\nFinally, on October 28, 2014, Chris Foley, derivatively on behalf of the Company, filed a shareholder derivative complaint in the Chancery Court of Knox County, Tennessee against the Individual Defendants and against the Company as a nominal defendant (the \u201cFoley Shareholder Derivative Lawsuit\u201d). The Foley Shareholder Derivative Lawsuit asserts the exact same facts and legal claims as the Montiminy Shareholder Derivative Lawsuit. Since the filing of the Foley Shareholder Derivative Lawsuit, the parties have submitted a proposed agreed order staying the Foley Derivative Lawsuit until the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee issues a ruling on the anticipated motion to dismiss the amended consolidated complaint to be filed in the Securities Litigation.\nIn each of the three Shareholder Derivative Lawsuits, the Company is a nominal defendant only. As such, the plaintiffs seek relief from the Individual Defendants, but not the Company itself.\nWe intend to defend these actions vigorously. We are currently unable to estimate a range of payments, if any, that we may be required to pay or may agree to pay with respect to the Federal Class Actions, the Hurtado Shareholder Derivative Lawsuit, the Montiminy Shareholder Derivative Lawsuit, and the Foley Shareholder Derivative Lawsuit. We believe that the resolution of these suits will not result in a material adverse effect to our consolidated financial statements. However, due to the inherent uncertainties that accompany litigation of this nature, there can be no assurance that we will be successful, and an adverse resolution of any of the lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, these actions may divert management\u2019s time and attention from our business, and we could be forced to expend significant resources and pay significant costs and expenses, including legal fees, in connection with defending the lawsuits.\nWe did not obtain and may not obtain or maintain the benefits associated with breakthrough therapy designation.\nOn March 21, 2014, we submitted a request for breakthrough therapy designation (BTD) to the FDA for PV-10 in the treatment of metastatic melanoma in the United States. The FDA denied the request in May 2014, but stated that a new request may be submitted if we obtain new clinical evidence that supports BTD. Accordingly, we are not entitled to the benefits of BTD, including expedited development and review of PV-10 in the treatment of melanoma.\nIf we resubmit such request for BTD, we may not be granted BTD, or even if granted, we may not receive the benefits associated with BTD. This may result from a failure to maintain breakthrough therapy status if PV-10 is no longer considered to be a breakthrough therapy. For example, a drug\u2019s development program may be granted BTD using early clinical testing that shows a much higher response rate than available therapies. However, subsequent interim data derived from a larger study may show a response that is substantially smaller than the response seen in early clinical testing. Another example is where BTD is granted to two drugs that are being developed for the same use. If one of the two drugs gains traditional approval, the other would not retain its designation unless its sponsor provided evidence that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over the recently approved drug. When BTD is no longer supported by emerging data or the designated drug development program is no longer being pursued, the FDA may choose to send a letter notifying the sponsor that the program is no longer designated as a BTD program.\nWe depend on the successful completion of clinical trials for our product candidates, including PV-10. The positive clinical results obtained for our product candidates in prior clinical studies may not be repeated in future clinical studies.\nBefore obtaining regulatory approval for the sale of our product candidates, including PV-10, we must conduct additional clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates. Clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. A failure of one or more of our clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. The outcome of pre-clinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. Moreover, pre-clinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in pre-clinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval for their products.\nIn October 2012, we presented final top-line data from the phase 2 trial of PV-10 for metastatic melanoma, and in March 2014, applied for BTD with the FDA, which was subsequently denied pending new clinical evidence that supports BTD. We (i) are conducting an expanded phase 1 trial for PV-10 for metastatic liver cancer, which is expected to be completed in early 2015; (ii) have completed a phase 1 clinical study for PV-10 for recurrent breast cancer; (iii) are conducting a phase 1 trial for\nPV-10 in an investigator initial study to ascertain the feasibility of detecting immune cell infiltrates in injected melanoma tumors which is expected to be completed in early 2015; (iv) are conducting a phase 2 clinical trial for mechanism of action of PH-10 for psoriasis; (v) have completed multiple phase 2 clinical trials for PH-10 for psoriasis and atopic dermatitis; and (vi) expect to commence a phase 3 clinical trial to assess response to intralesional PV-10 versus that of systemic chemotherapy in patients with disease confined to cutaneous and subcutaneous sites. Meetings with scientific advisors, investigators and advocates in the field have led us to expect a starting date for the phase 3 clinical study sometime in the first quarter of 2015. However, we have never conducted a phase 3 clinical trial. The positive results we have seen to date in our phase 2 clinical trials of PV-10 for metastatic melanoma do not ensure that later clinical trials will demonstrate similar results. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy characteristics despite having progressed satisfactorily through preclinical studies and initial clinical testing. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including those with greater resources and experience, have suffered significant setbacks in phase 3 clinical development; even after seeing promising results in earlier clinical trials.\nWe may experience a number of unforeseen events during clinical trials for our product candidates, including PV-10, that could delay or prevent the commencement and/or completion of our clinical trials, including the following:\n\u2022\nregulators or institutional review boards may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n\u2022\nthe clinical study protocol may require one or more amendments delaying study completion;\n\u2022\nclinical trials of our product candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs;\n\u2022\nthe number of subjects required for clinical trials of our product candidates may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials may be insufficient or slower than we anticipate or subjects may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n\u2022\nclinical investigators or study subjects fail to comply with clinical study protocols;\n\u2022\ntrial conduct and data analysis errors may occur, including, but not limited to, data entry and/or labeling errors;\n\u2022\nour third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u2022\nwe might have to suspend or terminate clinical trials of our product candidates for various reasons, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u2022\nregulators or institutional review boards may require that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nthe cost of clinical trials of our product candidates may be greater than we anticipate;\n\u2022\nthe supply or quality of our clinical trial materials or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates may be insufficient or inadequate; and\n\u2022\nour product candidates may have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics, causing us or our investigators to suspend or terminate the trials.\nWe expect our research and development expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly if we commence a phase 3 clinical trial with respect to PV-10 as planned, and undertake additional clinical trials of our other product candidates. Because successful development of our product candidates is uncertain, we are unable to estimate the actual funds required to complete research and development and commercialize our products under development; however, we believe we have sufficient cash on hand to fund the planned phase 3 clinical trial with respect to PV-10.\nNegative or inconclusive results of our future clinical trials of PV-10, or any other clinical trial we conduct, could cause the FDA to require that we repeat or conduct additional clinical studies. Despite the results reported in earlier clinical trials for PV-10, we do not know whether any clinical trials we may conduct will demonstrate adequate efficacy and safety to result in regulatory approval to market our product candidates, including PV-10. If later stage clinical trials do not produce favorable results, our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, including PV-10, may be adversely impacted.\nDelays in clinical trials are common and have many causes, and any delay could result in increased costs to us and jeopardize or delay our ability to obtain regulatory approval.\nClinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete, and is uncertain as to outcome. We may experience delays in clinical trials at any stage of development and testing of our product candidates. Our planned clinical trials may not begin on time, have an effective design, enroll a sufficient number of subjects, or be completed on schedule, if at all.\nEvents which may result in delays or unsuccessful completion of clinical trials, including our future clinical trials for PV-10, include the following:\n\u2022\ninability to raise funding, if necessary, to initiate or continue a trial;\n\u2022\ndelays in obtaining regulatory approval to commence a trial;\n\u2022\ndelays in reaching agreement with the FDA on final trial design;\n\u2022\nimposition of a clinical hold following an inspection of our clinical trial operations or trial sites by the FDA or other regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\ndelays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations (CROs) and clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\ndelays in obtaining required institutional review board (IRB) approval at each site;\n\u2022\ndelays in recruiting suitable patients to participate in a trial;\n\u2022\ndelays in having subjects complete participation in a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u2022\ndelays caused by subjects dropping out of a trial due to side effects or otherwise;\n\u2022\ndelays caused by clinical sites dropping out of a trial;\n\u2022\ntime required to add new clinical sites; and\n\u2022\ndelays by our contract manufacturers to produce and deliver sufficient supply of clinical trial materials.\nIf initiation or completion of any of our clinical trials for our product candidates, including PV-10, are delayed for any of the above reasons, our development costs may increase, the approval process could be delayed, any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates may be reduced and our competitors may bring products to market before us. Any of these events could impair our ability to generate revenues from product sales and impair our ability to generate regulatory and commercialization milestones and royalties, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nClinical trials are very expensive, time consuming and difficult to design and implement.\nHuman clinical trials are very expensive and difficult to design and implement, in part because they are subject to rigorous regulatory requirements. The clinical trial process is also time consuming. We estimate that current or future clinical trials of our prescription drug candidates will take additional years to complete. Furthermore, failure can occur at any stage of the trials, and we could encounter problems that cause us to abandon or repeat clinical trials. The commencement and completion of clinical trials may be delayed by several factors, including:\n\u2022\nunforeseen safety issues;\n\u2022\ndetermination of dosing issues;\n\u2022\nlack of effectiveness during clinical trials;\n\u2022\nslower than expected rates of patient recruitment;\n\u2022\ninability to monitor patients adequately during or after treatment; and\n\u2022\ninability or unwillingness of medical investigators to follow our clinical protocols.\nIn addition, we or the FDA may suspend our clinical trials at any time if it appears that we are exposing participants to unacceptable health risks or if the FDA finds deficiencies in our submissions or the conduct of these trials.\nThe results of our clinical trials may not support our claims concerning our prescription drug candidates.\nEven if our clinical trials are completed as planned, we cannot be certain that their results will support our claims concerning our prescription drug candidates. Success in nonclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and we cannot be sure that the results of later clinical trials will replicate the results of prior clinical trials and nonclinical testing. The clinical trial process may fail to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe for humans or effective for indicated uses. This failure would cause us to abandon a product candidate and may delay development of other product candidates. Any delay in, or termination of, our clinical trials will delay our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate product revenues. In addition, we anticipate that our clinical trials will involve only a small patient population. Accordingly, the results of such trials may not be indicative of future results over a larger patient population.\nPhysicians and patients may not accept and use our prescription drug candidates.\nEven if the FDA approves our prescription drug candidates, physicians and patients may not accept and use them. Acceptance and use of our prescription drug products will depend upon a number of factors including:\n\u2022\nperceptions by members of the healthcare community, including physicians, about the safety and effectiveness of our prescription drug products;\n\u2022\ncost-effectiveness of our prescription drug products relative to competing products;\n\u2022\navailability of reimbursement for our prescription drug products from government or other healthcare payers; and\n\u2022\neffectiveness of marketing and distribution efforts by us and our licensees and distributors, if any.\nBecause we expect sales or licensure of our prescription drug candidates, if approved, to generate substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future, the failure of any of these drugs to find market acceptance would harm our business and could require us to seek additional financing.\nWe have no sales, marketing or distribution capabilities for our prescription drug candidates or our OTC products and non-core technologies.\nWe currently have no sales, marketing or distribution capabilities. We do not anticipate having the resources in the foreseeable future to allocate to the sales and marketing of our prescription drug candidates or our OTC products and non-core technologies. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to enter into and maintain such collaborative relationships, the collaborator\u2019s strategic interest in the products under development and such collaborator\u2019s ability to successfully market and sell any such products. We intend to proceed as rapidly as possible with licensure of PH-10 on the basis of our Phase 2 atopic dermatitis and psoriasis results, which are in process of being further developed. We have determined that the most efficient use of our capital in further developing our OTC products is to license the products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to establish or maintain relationships with third party collaborators or develop in-house sales and distribution capabilities. To the extent that we depend on third parties for marketing and distribution, any revenues we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third parties, and there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful. In addition, there can also be no assurance that we will be able to market and sell our product in the United States or overseas.\nWe cannot be sure that our OTC products or non-core technologies will be licensed or sold in the marketplace.\nIn order for our OTC products to become commercially successful and our non-core technologies to be further developed, we must license or sell those products and technologies. We have been discussing this strategy with interested groups, though we cannot be sure that we will be successful in licensing or selling such products or technologies.\nCompetition in the prescription pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries is intense, and we may be unable to succeed if our competitors have more funding or better marketing.\nThe pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive. Other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and research organizations currently engage in or have in the past engaged in research efforts related to treatment of dermatological conditions or cancers of the skin, liver and breast, which could lead to the development of products or therapies that could compete directly with the prescription drug and other product candidates, and OTC products that we are seeking to develop and market.\nMany companies are also developing alternative therapies to treat cancer and dermatological conditions and, in this regard, are our competitors. Many of the pharmaceutical companies developing and marketing these competing products have significantly greater financial resources and expertise than we do in:\n\u2022\nresearch and development;\n\u2022\nmanufacturing;\n\u2022\npreclinical and clinical testing;\n\u2022\nobtaining regulatory approvals; and\n\u2022\nmarketing.\nSmaller companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Academic institutions, government agencies, and other public and private research organizations may also conduct research, seek patent protection, and establish collaborative arrangements for research, clinical development, and marketing of products similar to ours. These companies and institutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to our programs.\nIn addition to the above factors, we expect to face competition in the following areas:\n\u2022\nproduct efficacy and safety;\n\u2022\nthe timing and scope of regulatory consents;\n\u2022\navailability of resources;\n\u2022\nreimbursement coverage;\n\u2022\nprice; and\n\u2022\npatent position, including potentially dominant patent positions of others.\nSince our prescription candidates PV-10 and PH-10 have not yet been approved by the FDA or introduced to the marketplace, we cannot estimate what competition these products might face when they are finally introduced, if at all. We cannot assure you that these products will not face significant competition for other prescription drugs and generic equivalents.\nIf we are unable to secure or enforce patent rights, trademarks, trade secrets or other intellectual property our business could be harmed.\nWe may not be successful in securing or maintaining proprietary patent protection for our products and technologies we develop or license. In addition, our competitors may develop products similar to ours using methods and technologies that are beyond the scope of our intellectual property protection, which could reduce our anticipated sales. While some of our products have proprietary patent protection, a challenge to these patents can subject us to expensive litigation. Litigation concerning patents, other forms of intellectual property, and proprietary technology is becoming more widespread and can be protracted and expensive and can distract management and other personnel from performing their duties.\nWe also rely upon trade secrets, unpatented proprietary know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop a competitive position. We cannot assure you that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary technology and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and technology, or that we can adequately protect our trade secrets and technology.\nIf we are unable to secure or enforce patent rights, trademarks, trade secrets, or other intellectual property, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. If we infringe on the intellectual property of others, our business could be harmed.\nWe could be sued for infringing patents or other intellectual property that purportedly cover products and/or methods of using such products held by persons other than us. Litigation arising from an alleged infringement could result in removal from the market, or a substantial delay in, or prevention of, the introduction of our products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIf we do not update and enhance our technologies, they will become obsolete.\nThe pharmaceutical market is characterized by rapid technological change, and our future success will depend on our ability to conduct successful research in our fields of expertise, to discover new technologies as a result of that research, to develop\nproducts based on our technologies, and to commercialize those products. While we believe that our current technology is adequate for our present needs, if we fail to stay at the forefront of technological development, we will be unable to compete effectively. Our competitors are using substantial resources to develop new pharmaceutical technologies and to commercialize products based on those technologies. Accordingly, our technologies may be rendered obsolete by advances in existing technologies or the development of different technologies by one or more of our current or future competitors.\nIf we lose any of our key personnel, we may be unable to successfully execute our business plan.\nOur business is presently managed by four key employees:\n\u2022\nH. Craig Dees, Ph.D., our Chief Executive Officer;\n\u2022\nTimothy C. Scott, Ph.D., our President;\n\u2022\nEric A. Wachter, Ph.D. our Chief Technology Officer; and\n\u2022\nPeter R. Culpepper, CPA, MBA, our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer.\nIn addition to their responsibilities for management of our overall business strategy, Drs. Dees, Scott and Wachter are our chief researchers in the fields in which we are developing and planning to develop our prescription drug and other product candidates, and our OTC products. The loss of any of these key employees could have a material adverse effect on our operations, and our ability to execute our business plan might be negatively impacted. Any of these key employees may leave their employment with us if they choose to do so, and we cannot assure you that we would be able to hire similarly qualified employees if any of our key employees should choose to leave.\nBecause we have only four employees in total, our management may be unable to successfully manage our business.\nIn order to successfully execute our business plan, our management must succeed in all of the following critical areas:\n\u2022\nResearching diseases and possible therapies in the areas of dermatology and skin care, oncology, and biotechnology;\n\u2022\nDeveloping our prescription drug and other product candidates, and OTC products based on our research;\n\u2022\nMarketing and selling developed products;\n\u2022\nObtaining additional capital to finance research, development, production, and marketing of our products; and\n\u2022\nManaging our business as it grows.\nAs discussed above, we currently have only four employees, all of whom are full-time employees. The greatest burden of succeeding in the above areas, therefore, falls on Drs. Dees, Scott, Wachter, and Mr. Culpepper. Focusing on any one of these areas may divert their attention from our other areas of concern and could affect our ability to manage other aspects of our business. We cannot assure you that our management will be able to succeed in all of these areas or, even if we do so succeed, that our business will be successful as a result. We have added, including our employees, a total of fifty-five (55) human resources on a full-time equivalent basis. While we have not historically had difficulty in attracting employees, our small size and limited operating history may make it difficult for us to attract and retain employees in the future, which could further divert management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business.\nThe market price of our common stock has been highly volatile due to several factors that will continue to affect the price of our common stock.\nOur common stock has traded as low as $0.30 per share and as high as $6.03 per share during the period beginning on January 1, 2013 and ending on December 31, 2014. We believe that our common stock is subject to wide price fluctuations because of several factors, including:\n\u2022\nabsence of meaningful earnings and ongoing need for external financing;\n\u2022\na relatively thin trading market for our common stock, which causes trades of small blocks of stock to have a significant impact on our stock price;\n\u2022\ngeneral volatility of the stock market and the market prices of other publicly-traded companies; and\n\u2022\ninvestor sentiment regarding equity markets generally, including public perception of corporate ethics and governance and the accuracy and transparency of financial reporting.\nFinancings that may be available to us under current market conditions frequently involve sales at prices below the prices at which our common stock trades on the NYSE MKT, as well as the issuance of warrants or convertible equity or debt that\nrequire exercise or conversion prices that are calculated in the future at a discount to the then market price of our common stock. The current economic downturn has made the financings available to development-stage companies like us more dilutive in nature than they would otherwise be.\nAny agreement to sell, or convert debt or equity securities into, our common stock at a future date and at a price based on the then current market price will provide an incentive to the investor or third parties to sell our common stock short to decrease the price and increase the number of shares they may receive in a future purchase, whether directly from us or in the market.\nOur stock price is below $5.00 per share and is treated as a \u201cpenny stock\u201d, which places restrictions on broker-dealers recommending the stock for purchase.\nOur common stock is defined as \u201cpenny stock\u201d under the Exchange Act and its rules. The SEC has adopted regulations that define \u201cpenny stock\u201d to include common stock that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. These rules include the following requirements:\n\u2022\nbroker-dealers must deliver, prior to the transaction, a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market;\n\u2022\nbroker-dealers must disclose the commissions payable to the broker-dealer and its registered representative;\n\u2022\nbroker-dealers must disclose current quotations for the securities; and\n\u2022\na broker-dealer must furnish its customers with monthly statements disclosing recent price information for all penny stocks held in the customer\u2019s account and information on the limited market in penny stocks.\nAdditional sales practice requirements are imposed on broker-dealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. For these types of transactions, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and must have received the purchaser\u2019s written consent to the transaction prior to sale. If our common stock remains subject to these penny stock rules these disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for our common stock. As a result, fewer broker-dealers may be willing to make a market in our stock, which could affect a shareholder\u2019s ability to sell their shares.\nFuture sales by our stockholders may adversely affect our stock price and our ability to raise funds in new stock offerings.\nSales of our common stock in the public market following any prospective offering could lower the market price of our common stock. Sales may also make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that our management deems acceptable. The recent economic downturn has made the financings available to development-stage companies like us more dilutive in nature than they would otherwise be.\nWe currently intend to retain all of our future earnings rather than pay a cash dividend.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, for use in our business and therefore do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.", "PERMNO": 68276, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "PVCT"}
