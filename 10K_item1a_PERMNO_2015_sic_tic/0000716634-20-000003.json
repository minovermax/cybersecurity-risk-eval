{"cik": "716634", "company": "READING INTERNATIONAL INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A - Risk Factors\n\ufeff\nInvesting in our securities involves risk. Set forth below is a summary of various risk factors that you should consider in connection with your investment in our Company. This summary should be considered in the context of our overall Annual Report on Form 10-K, as many of the topics addressed below, and our plans to address or mitigate the risks involved, are discussed in significantly greater detail in the context of specific discussions of our business plan, our operating results, and the various competitive forces that we face.\n\ufeff\nBUSINESS RISK FACTORS\n\ufeff\nWe are currently engaged principally in the cinema exhibition and real estate businesses. Because we operate in two business segments (cinema exhibition and real estate), we discuss separately below the risks we believe to be material to our involvement in each of these segments. We have discussed separately certain risks relating to the international nature of our business activities, our use of leverage, and our status as a controlled corporation. Please note that, while we report the results of our live theatre operations as real estate operations - because we are principally in the business of renting space to producers rather than in producing plays ourselves - the cinema exhibition and live theatre businesses share certain risk factors and are, accordingly, discussed together below.\n\ufeff\nCinema Exhibition and Live Theatre Business Risk Factors\n\ufeff\nOur cinema and live theatre businesses are vulnerable to the effects from the coronavirus outbreak which could cause customers to avoid public assembly seating and has delayed the release of major motion pictures. The currently developing coronavirus outbreak could cause patrons to avoid our cinemas and live theatres or other public places where large crowds are in attendance. Outbreaks of the coronavirus have caused cinemas and other public assembly venues to close in certain parts of the world. As the coronavirus spreads in the United States, Australia and New Zealand, the Company may elect on a voluntary basis to close some of our cinemas or portions of our cinemas, or governmental officials may order such closures. Certain major studios have announced the delayed release of major motion pictures to later in the year. At a minimum, the delayed releases of major motion pictures will push revenues into later quarters, will potentially reduce our full year revenues and may accelerate the Company\u2019s decisions to consider reduction of operational levels at our cinemas.\n\ufeff\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment with many competitors who are significantly larger and may have significantly better access to funds than we do. We are a comparatively small cinema operator and face competition from much larger cinema exhibitors. These larger exhibitors are able to offer distributors more screens in more markets - including markets where they may be the exclusive exhibitor - than can we. Faced with such competition, we may not be able to get access to all of the films we want, which may adversely affect our revenue and profitability.\n\ufeff\nWhile we are concerned about the use of larger competitors of national and international booking power to limit our access to film, there is little we can do to mitigate this risk as antitrust litigation is very expensive and typically long lived. Moreover, on November 22, 2019, the United States Department of Justice - Antitrust Division filed a motion to terminate the so called \u201cParamount Decree;\u201d the principal judicial precedent regulating the distributor/exhibitor relationship (United States vs. Paramount Pictures, Inc. (334 U.S. 131 (1948)) and which included prohibitions on so called \u201cblock booking\u201d and \u201ccircuit dealing.\u201d This motion is opposed by independent cinema operators, who - like ourselves - believe that this will further strengthen the competitive advantages of the national circuits. The status of the \u201cParamount Decree\u201d, and the protections afforded to independent cinemas, is uncertain. A repeal of the \u201cParamount Decree\u201d may also adversely impact small independent film producers, a major source of film product for our art cinemas.\n\ufeff\nSeveral distributors have announced that they will generally provide access of film to all who desire it. However, this practice is not universal and is not necessarily indicative of how these distributors will chose to distribute film in a post \u201cParamount Decree\u201d environment. There is a risk that film rents charged by major distributors will include account volume discounts which will favor national or international chains. Also, as a practical matter, for major commercial films, the terms of exhibition demanded by the distributors of such films are limiting the cinema operators who can exhibit the film by requiring that their films be shown on a minimum number of screens and for a minimum period of time at each cinema. Many smaller theaters simply cannot accommodate these requirements due to their more limited screen count and limited number of outlets in a given market. This competitive disadvantage has been, in our view, exacerbated in recent periods with the further concentration of the cinema exhibition industry, for example, Cineworld Group Plc\u2019s acquisition of Regal Entertainment Group and Dalian Wanda\u2019s acquisition of AMC Entertainment, which has now acquired Carmike Cinemas, Odeon and UCI Cinemas Group and Nordic Cinema Group.\n\ufeff\nIncreasingly, national operators in the United States are offering various discount and loyalty programs. We believe that these have been effective in increasing attendances at theaters in the United States operated by \u201cnational chains\u201d at the expense of independent cinemas such as ourselves. It is unclear at this time as to how these discounts are affecting film rents paid by these exhibitors. A discount or loyalty program is, we believe, more effective when the card or benefit provides access to a significant number of theaters and is less effective in the case of an independent cinema which may only service a very limited number of markets. For an independent cinema operator, the only competitive option may be to reduce ticket prices.\n\ufeff\n- 17 -\nThese larger competitors may also enjoy (i) greater cash flow, which can be used to develop additional cinemas, including cinemas that may be competitive with our existing cinemas, (ii) better access to equity capital and debt, (iii) better visibility to landlords and real estate developers, (iv) for the sake of building volume, to operate cinemas with margins below our threshold for cinema acquisitions and/or development, and (v) better economies of scale.\n\ufeff\nIn the case of our live theatres, we compete for shows not only with other \u201cfor profit\u201d Off-Broadway theaters, but also with \u201cnot-for-profit\u201d operators and, increasingly, with Broadway theaters. We believe our live theatres are generally competitive with other Off-Broadway venues. However, due to the increased cost of staging live theatre productions, we are seeing an increasing tendency for plays that would historically have been staged in an Off-Broadway theater moving directly to larger Broadway venues.\n\ufeff\nWe face competition from other sources of entertainment and other entertainment delivery systems. Both our cinema and live theatre operations face competition from \u201cin-home\u201d and mobile device sources of entertainment. These include competition from network, cable and satellite television, internet streaming video services, Video on Demand, the internet, video games and other sources of entertainment. The quality of \u201cin-home\u201d and mobile entertainment systems, as well as programming available on an in-home and mobile basis, has increased, while the cost to consumers of such systems (and such programming) has decreased in recent periods, and some consumers may prefer the security and/or convenience of an \u201cin-home\u201d or mobile entertainment experience to the more public and presentation oriented experience offered by our cinemas and live theatres. Film distributors have been responding to these developments by, in some cases, decreasing or eliminating the period of time between cinema release and the date such product is made available to \u201cin-home\u201d or mobile forms of distribution.\n\ufeff\nThere is the risk that, over time, distributors may move towards simultaneous release of motion picture product in multiple channels of distribution. Also, some traditional in-home and mobile distributors have begun the production of full-length movies, specifically for the purpose of direct or simultaneous release to the in-home and mobile markets. These factors may adversely affect the competitive advantage enjoyed by cinemas over \u201cin-home\u201d and mobile forms of entertainment, as it may be that the cinema market and the \u201cin-home\u201d and mobile markets will have simultaneous access to the same motion picture product. In recent times, a number of movies were released on a simultaneous basis to movie exhibitors and to in-home and mobile markets. It is likely that this trend will continue, making it, in our view, increasingly important for exhibitors to enhance the convenience and quality of the theater-going experience. This can require substantial capital outlays and increased labor expense, which exhibitors may not be able to fully pass on to their customers. Also, the amount of programming (including without limitation, the live streaming of sporting, theatrical and political events) available on an \u201cin-home\u201d and mobile basis continues to increase.\n\ufeff\nThe narrowing and/or elimination of this so-called \u201cwindow\u201d for cinema exhibition may be problematic for the cinema exhibition industry. However, to date, attempts by the major film distributors to continue to narrow or eliminate the window have been strenuously resisted by the cinema exhibition industry, and we view the total elimination of the cinema exhibition window by major film distributors, while theoretically possible, to be unlikely.\n\ufeff\nNetflix has achieved broad market acceptance, with over 167 million subscribers. In addition, Netflix reported production of approximately 73 full-length feature films in 2019 - virtually all of which went straight to streaming. In addition, traditional content providers, such as Walt Disney, Warner Media and Comcast\u2019s NBCUniversal, and HBO, and new entrants such as Apple, are now offering or have announced plans to offer later this year, direct to consumer streaming services on a fixed fee basis. The impact of this competition is unclear. But, in order to compete with these in-home and mobile forms of distribution, it is likely that we will need to make material capital improvements to our cinemas to increase the amenities and quality of presentation delivered. It may also be necessary to reduce admission prices.\n\ufeff\nWe also face competition from various other forms of \u201cbeyond-the-home\u201d entertainment, including sporting events, concerts, restaurants, casinos, video game arcades, and nightclubs. Our cinemas also face competition from live theatres and vice versa. Also, social media offerings - such as Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat - appear to be commanding increasing portions of the recreational time of our potential audience.\n\ufeff\nOur cinema and live theatre businesses may be vulnerable to fears of terrorism and random shooter incidents and of exposure to infectious disease which could cause customers to avoid public assembly seating. Political events, such as terrorist attacks, random shooter incidents and health-related epidemics, pandemics, such as the coronavirus outbreak discussed above and flu outbreaks, could cause patrons to avoid our cinemas or other public places where large crowds are in attendance. We believe that recent shooting incidents involving other public assembly situations have resulted in material increases in insurance premiums for cinema operators such as ourselves.\n\ufeff\nOur cinema business may be vulnerable to natural disasters. A natural disaster, such as a typhoon or an earthquake, could impact and has impacted, in New Zealand, our ability to operate certain of our cinemas, which could adversely affect, and has historically adversely affected, in New Zealand, our results of operations. A material portion of our cinemas are located in seismically active areas, such as California, Hawaii and New Zealand.\n\ufeff\n- 18 -\nOur cinema operations depend upon access to film and alternative entertainment product that is attractive to our patrons, and our live theatre operations depend upon the continued attractiveness of our theaters to producers. Our ability to generate revenue and profits is largely dependent on factors outside of our control, specifically, the continued ability of motion picture, alternative entertainment and live theatre producers to produce films, alternative entertainment and plays that are attractive to audiences, the amount of money spent by film and alternative entertainment distributors and theatrical producers to promote their motion pictures, alternative entertainment and plays, and the willingness of these distributors and producers to license their films and alternative entertainment on terms that are financially viable to our cinemas and to rent our theaters for the presentation of their plays. To the extent that popular movies, alternative entertainment and plays are produced, our cinema and live theatre activities are ultimately dependent upon our ability, in the face of competition from other cinema and live theatre operators to book such movies, alternative entertainment and plays into our facilities, and to provide a superior customer offering.\n\ufeff\nDistribution of film is in the discretion of the film distribution companies. Accordingly, we are at risk that the distributors may not give us all of the film we request.\n\ufeff\nAdverse economic conditions could materially affect our business by reducing discretionary income and by limiting or reducing sources of film and live theatre funding. Going to a movie or a play is a luxury, not a necessity. Furthermore, consumer demand for better and better amenities and food offerings have resulted in an increase of the cost of a night at the movies. Accordingly, a decline in the economy resulting in a decrease in discretionary income, or a perception of such a decline, may result in decreased discretionary spending, which could adversely affect our cinema and live theatre businesses. Adverse economic conditions can also affect the supply side of our business, as reduced liquidity can adversely affect the availability of funding for movies and plays. This is particularly true in the case of Off-Broadway plays, which are often times financed by high net worth individuals (or groups of such individuals) and that are very risky due to the absence of any ability to recoup investment in secondary markets like-- cable, satellite or internet distribution.\n\ufeff\nOur screen advertising or auditorium leasing revenue may decline. Over the past several years, cinema exhibitors have been looking increasingly to screen advertising and auditorium leasing as a way to improve income. No assurances can be given that this source of income will be continuing, or that the use of screen advertising will not ultimately prove to be counterproductive, by giving consumers a disincentive to choose going to the movies over \u201cin-home\u201d or mobile entertainment alternatives. Screen advertising revenues are typically tied to attendance. Consequently, declining attendance would likewise result in decreased screen advertising revenues.\n\ufeff\nWe face uncertainty as to the timing and direction of technological innovations in the cinema exhibition business and as to our access to those technologies. We have converted all of our cinema auditoriums to digital projection. However, no assurances can be given that other technological advances will not require us to make further material investments in our cinemas or face loss of business. Also, equipment is currently being developed for holographic or laser projection. The future of these technologies in the cinema exhibition industry is uncertain.\n\ufeff\nWe face competition from competitors offering food and beverage and luxury seating as an integral part of their cinema offerings. The number of our competitors offering an expanded food and beverage menu (including the sale of alcoholic beverages) and luxury seating, has continued to grow in recent periods. In addition, more competitors such as AMC are converting existing cinemas to provide such expanded menu offerings and in-theater dining options. The existence of such cinemas may alter traditional cinema selection practices of moviegoers, as they seek out cinemas with such expanded offerings as a preferred alternative to traditional cinemas. In order to compete with these new cinemas, the Company has been required to materially increase its capital expenditures to add such features to many of our cinemas and to take on additional and more highly trained (and, consequently, compensated) staff. Also, the conversion to luxury seating typically requires a material reduction in the number of seats that an auditorium can accommodate which may translate into fewer movie tickets being sold and the shutdown (or limitation of activities) during the time required to complete such modifications.\n\ufeff\nOur failure to obtain and maintain liquor licenses at any of our cinemas could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Each of our cinemas offering beer and wine, and in some cases liquor, is subject to licensing and regulation by the alcoholic beverage control agency in the state, county and municipality in which the cinema is located. Each cinema is required to obtain a license to sell alcoholic beverages on the premises from a state authority and, in certain locations, county and municipal authorities. Typically, licenses must be renewed annually and may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time. Alcoholic beverage control regulations relate to numerous aspects of the daily operations of each cinema, including minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventory control and handling and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. The failure to receive or retain a liquor license, or any other required permit or license, in a particular location, or to continue to qualify for, or renew licenses, could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, our ability to attract patrons, and our ability to obtain such a liquor license in other locations.\n\ufeff\nWe may be subject to increased labor and benefits costs generally. We are subject to laws governing such matters as minimum wages, working conditions and overtime. As minimum wage rates increase and/or limitations are imposed on our ability to adjust staffing levels to reflect cinema attendances, we may need to increase not only the wages of our minimum wage employees, but also\n- 19 -\nthe wages paid to employees at wage rates that are above minimum wage and to incur higher amounts overtime and over-staffing costs. Labor shortages, increased employee turnover and health care mandates could also increase our labor costs. This in turn could lead us to increase prices which could impact our sales. Conversely, if competitive pressures or other factors prevent us from offsetting increased labor costs by increases in prices, our results of operations may be adversely impacted.\n\ufeff\nCybersecurity threats, ADA issues, and our failure to protect our electronically stored data could adversely affect our business. We store and maintain electronic information and data necessary to conduct our business. Data maintained in electronic form is subject to the risk of intrusion, tampering and theft. While we believe that we have adopted industry-accepted security measures and technology to protect the confidential and proprietary information, the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. As such, we may be unable to anticipate and implement adequate preventive measures in time. Cybersecurity has been an area of increasing government attention and regulations, and in many jurisdictions, statutes have been passed, or are under consideration, imposing penalties and fines related to breaches of a company\u2019s cybersecurity. This may adversely affect our business, including exposure to government enforcement actions and private litigation, and our reputation with our customers and employees may be injured. In addition to Company-specific cyber threats or attacks, our business and results of operations could also be impacted by breaches affecting our peers and partners within the entertainment industry, as well as other retail companies. Also, recently adopted expansions of ADA type laws to cover access to websites and uncertainty as to the requirements of such new laws may result in litigation claims that could adversely impact our results of operation.\n\ufeff\nReal Estate Development and Ownership Business Risks\n\ufeff\nOur real estate business is vulnerable to the effects from the coronavirus outbreak which we expect may adversely impact our retail tenants' operations and, in turn, result in an increase in tenant defaults and rent reductions. The currently developing coronavirus outbreak could cause patrons to avoid our tenant's retail businesses or other public places where large crowds are in attendance. As the coronavirus spreads in the United States, Australia and New Zealand, we expect that it may adversely impact the retail businesses of our tenants which, in turn, would likely result in an increase in the number of tenant defaults under their respective lease agreement and/or requests for rent reduction or rent abatement. Also, our certain of our tenants may elect on a voluntary basis to close on a temporary basis, or governmental officials may order such closures. Any of these events would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\ufeff\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment in which we must compete against companies with much greater financial and human resources than we have. We have limited financial and human resources, compared to our principal real estate competitors. In recent periods, we have relied heavily on outside professionals in connection with our real estate development activities. Many of our competitors have significantly greater resources and may be able to achieve greater economies of scale than we can. Given our structure as a taxable corporation, our cost of capital is typically higher than other real estate investment vehicles such as real estate investment trusts.\n\ufeff\nRisks Related to the Real Estate Industry Generally\n\ufeff\nOur financial performance will be affected by risks associated with the real estate industry generally. Events and conditions generally applicable to developers, owners, and operators of real property will affect our performance as well. These include (i) changes in the national, regional and local economic climate, (ii) local conditions, such as an oversupply of, or a reduction in demand for, commercial space and/or entertainment-oriented properties, (iii) reduced attractiveness of our properties to tenants, (iv) the rental rates and capitalization rates applicable to the markets in which we operate and the quality of properties that we own, (v) competition from other properties, (vi) inability to collect rent from tenants, (vii) increased operating costs, including labor, materials, real estate taxes, insurance premiums, and utilities, (viii) costs of complying with changes in government regulations, (ix) the relative illiquidity of real estate investments, and (x) decreases in sources of both construction and long-term lending as traditional sources of such funding leave or reduce their commitments to real estate-based lending. In addition, periods of rising interest rates or declining demand for real estate (for example, due to competition from internet sellers the demand for brick and mortar retail spaces has declined and may continue to decline, and due to the increasing popularity of tele-commuting demand for traditional office space has likewise declined and may likewise continue to decline), or the public perception that any of these events may occur, could result in declining rents or increased lease defaults. Increasing cap rates can result in lower property values. Also, we have holdings in areas that are subject to earthquake, storm and flooding risk.\n\ufeff\nWe may incur costs complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act and similar laws. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act and similar statutory regimes in Australia and New Zealand or under applicable state or local law, all places of public accommodation (including cinemas and theaters) are required to meet certain governmental requirements related to access and use by persons with disabilities. A determination that we are not in compliance with those governmental requirements with respect to any of our properties could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. The cost of addressing these issues could be substantial.\n\ufeff\n- 20 -\nIlliquidity of real estate investments could impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties. Real estate investments are relatively illiquid and, therefore, tend to limit our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions. Many of our properties are either (i) \u201cspecial purpose\u201d properties that could not be readily converted to general residential, retail or office use, or (ii) undeveloped land. In addition, certain significant expenditures associated with real estate investment, such as real estate taxes and maintenance costs, are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investment, and competitive factors may prevent the pass-through of such costs to tenants.\n\ufeff\nReal estate development involves a variety of risks.\n\ufeff\nReal estate development involves a variety of risks, including the following:\n\u00b7\nThe identification and acquisition of suitable development properties. Competition for suitable development properties is intense. Our ability to identify and acquire development properties may be limited by our size and resources. Also, as we and our affiliates are considered to be \u201cforeign owned\u201d for purposes of certain Australian and New Zealand statutes, we have been in the past, and may in the future be, subject to regulations that are not applicable to other persons doing business in those countries.\n\u00b7\nThe procurement of necessary land use entitlements for the project. This process can take many years, particularly if opposed by competing interests. Competitors and community groups (sometimes funded by such competitors) may object based on various factors, including, for example, impacts on density, parking, traffic, noise levels and the historic or architectural nature of the building being replaced. If they are unsuccessful at the local governmental level, they may seek recourse to the courts or other tribunals. This can delay projects and increase costs.\n\u00b7\nThe construction of the project on time and on budget. Construction risks include the availability and cost of financing; the availability and costs of material and labor; the costs of dealing with unknown site conditions (including addressing pollution or environmental wastes deposited upon the property by prior owners); inclement weather conditions; and the ever-present potential for labor-related disruptions.\n\u00b7\nThe leasing or sell-out of the project. Ultimately, there are risks involved in the leasing of a rental property or the sale of a condominium or built-for-sale property. For our ETCs, the extent to which our cinemas can continue to serve as an anchor tenant will be influenced by the same factors as will influence generally the results of our cinema operations. Leasing or sale can be influenced by economic factors that are neither known nor knowable at the commencement of the development process and by local, national, and even international economic conditions, both real and perceived.\n\u00b7\nThe refinancing of completed properties. Properties are often developed using relatively short-term loans. Upon completion of the project, it may be necessary to find replacement financing for these loans. This process involves risk as to the availability of such permanent or other take-out financing, the interest rates, and the payment terms applicable to such financing, which may be adversely influenced by local, national, or international factors.\n\ufeff\nThe ownership of properties involves risk. The ownership of investment properties involves risks, such as: (i) ongoing leasing and re-leasing risks, (ii) ongoing financing and re-financing risks, (iii) market risks as to the multiples offered by buyers of investment properties, (iv) risks related to the ongoing compliance with changing governmental regulation (including, without limitation, environmental laws and requirements to remediate environmental contamination that may exist on a property (such as, by way of example, asbestos), even though not deposited on the property by us), (v) relative illiquidity compared to some other types of assets, and (vi) susceptibility of assets to uninsurable risks, such as biological, chemical or nuclear terrorism, or risks that are subject to caps tied to the concentration of such assets in certain geographic areas, such as earthquakes. Furthermore, as our properties are typically developed around an entertainment use, the attractiveness of these properties to tenants, sources of finance and real estate investors will be influenced by market perceptions of the benefits and detriments of such entertainment-type properties.\n\ufeff\nA number of our assets are in geologically active areas, presenting risk of earthquake and land movement. We have properties in California, Hawaii and New Zealand, areas that present a greater risk of earthquake and/or land movement than other locations. New Zealand has in recent periods had several major earthquakes damaging our facilities in Christchurch and Wellington resulting in closures or partial closures of said facilities and consequent reduction in revenue and cash flow. The ability to insure for such casualties is limited and may become more difficult and/or more expensive in future periods.\n\ufeff\nWe may be subject to liability under environmental laws and regulations. We own and operate a large number of cinemas and other properties within the U.S. and internationally, which may be subject to various foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment or human health. Such environmental laws and regulations include those that impose liability for the investigation and remediation of spills or releases of hazardous materials. We may incur such liability, including for any currently or formerly owned, leased or operated property, or for any site, to which we may have disposed, or arranged for the disposal of, hazardous materials or wastes. Certain of these laws and regulations may impose liability, including on a joint and several liability, which can result in a liable party being obliged to pay for greater than its share, regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal. Environmental conditions relating to our properties or operations could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations and cash flows.\n\ufeff\n- 21 -\nLegislative or regulatory initiatives related to global warming/climate change concerns may negatively impact our business. Recently, there has been an increasing focus and continuous debate on global climate change including increased attention from regulatory agencies and legislative bodies. This increased focus may lead to new initiatives directed at regulating an as yet unspecified array of environmental matters. Legislative, regulatory or other efforts in the U.S. to combat climate change could result in future increases in the cost of raw materials, taxes, transportation and utilities for our vendors and for us which would result in higher operating costs for the Company. Also, compliance by our cinemas and accompanying real estate with new and revised environmental, zoning, land-use or building codes, laws, rules or regulations, could have a material and adverse effect on our business. However, we are unable to predict at this time, the potential effects, if any, that any future environmental initiatives may have on our business.\n\ufeff\nChanges in interest rates may increase our interest expense. Because a portion of our debt bears interest at variable rates, increases in interest rates could materially increase our interest expense. In each of August, September and October 2019, the U.S. Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point, with additional decreases expected to come over the next year. If interest rates continue increasing, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. Based on our debt outstanding as of December 31, 2019, if interest rates were to increase by 1%, the corresponding increase in interest expense on our variable rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $1.2 million per year. Potential future increases in interest rates may therefore negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations, and reduce our access to the debt or equity capital markets.\n\ufeff\nUncertainty relating to the likely phasing out of LIBOR by 2021 may result in paying increased interest under our credit facilities. Some of our variable rate indebtedness uses LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the rate. LIBOR is the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. These reforms and other pressures may cause LIBOR to disappear entirely or to perform differently than in the past. At this time, it is not possible to predict the effect that any discontinuance, modification or other reform of LIBOR or any other reference rate, or the establishment of alternative reference rates, may have on LIBOR, other benchmarks, or LIBOR-based debt instruments. However, the use of alternative reference rates or other reforms could cause the interest rates payable under our credit facilities to be substantially higher than we would otherwise have expected.\n- 22 -\n\ufeff\nInternational Business Risks\n\ufeff\nOur international operations are subject to a variety of risks, including the following:\n\u00b7\nCurrency Risk: while we report our earnings and net assets in U.S. dollars, substantial portions of our revenue and of our obligations are denominated in either Australian or New Zealand dollars. The value of these currencies can vary significantly compared to the U.S. dollar and compared to each other. We do not hedge the currency risk, but rather have relied upon the natural hedges that exist as a result of the fact that our film costs are typically fixed as a percentage of the box office, and our local operating costs and obligations are likewise typically denominated in local currencies. However, we do have intercompany debt and our ability to service this debt could be adversely impacted by declines in the relative value of the Australian and New Zealand dollar compared to the U.S. dollar. Also, our use of local borrowings to mitigate the business risk of currency fluctuations has reduced our flexibility to move cash between jurisdictions. Set forth below is a chart of the exchange ratios between these three currencies since 1996:\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nIn recent periods, we have repaid intercompany debt and used the proceeds to fund capital investment in the United States. Accordingly, our debt levels in Australia are higher than they would have been if funds had not been returned for such purposes. On a company wide basis, this means that a reduction in the relative strength of the U.S. dollar versus the Australian Dollar and/or the New Zealand dollar would effectively raise the overall cost of our borrowing and capital and make it more expensive to return funds from the United States to Australia and New Zealand.\n\u00b7\nRisk of adverse government regulation: currently, we believe that relations between the United States, Australia, and New Zealand are good. However, no assurances can be given that these relationships will continue, and that Australia and New Zealand will not in the future seek to regulate more highly the business done by U.S. companies in their countries.\n\u00b7\nRisk of adverse labor relations: deterioration in labor relations could lead to an increased cost of labor (including future government requirements with respect to pension liabilities, disability insurance and health coverage, and vacations and leave).\n\ufeff\n- 23 -\nTrade disputes and geopolitical instability outside of the U.S. may adversely impact the U.S. and global economies.\n\ufeff\nIn 2019, global growth weakened, trade tensions heightened, and several emerging markets experienced significant downturns as macroeconomic and geopolitical developments weighed on market sentiments. Governmental policies of developed economies, such as the U.S., have a substantial effect on emerging markets, and the consequences of a trade war between two developed countries, like that of the U.S. and China, could further contribute to the adverse economic and political conditions of emerging and other developed economies. Additionally, North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons capabilities continue to be an ongoing security concern and worsening relations between the U.S. and North Korea continue to create a global security issue that may adversely affect international business and economic conditions. While it is difficult for us to predict the effect of such trade wars and heightened geopolitical and economic instability on our business, they could lead to currency devaluation, economic and political turmoil, market volatility, and a loss of consumer confidence in the broader U.S. economy.\n\ufeff\nRisks Associated with Certain Discontinued Operations\n\ufeff\nCertain of our subsidiaries were previously in industrial businesses. As a consequence, properties that are currently owned or may have in the past been owned, by these subsidiaries may prove to have environmental issues. Where we have knowledge of such environmental issues and are in a position to make an assessment as to our exposure, we have established what we believe to be appropriate reserves, but we are exposed to the risk that currently unknown problems may be discovered. These subsidiaries are also exposed to potential claims related to exposure of former employees to coal dust, asbestos, and other materials now considered to be, or which in the future may be found to be, carcinogenic or otherwise injurious to health.\n\ufeff\nOperating, Financial Structure and Borrowing Risk\n\ufeff\nTypically, we have negative working capital. As we invest our cash in new acquisitions and the development of our existing properties, we have negative working capital. This negative working capital is typical in the cinema exhibition industry because our short-term liabilities are in part financing our long-term assets instead of long-term liabilities financing short-term assets, as is the case in other industries such as manufacturing and distribution. In addition, the new lease accounting standard requires us to include the current portion of our operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. See Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Operating Leases.\n\ufeff\nWe are subject to complex taxation, changes in tax rates, adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and disagreements with tax authorities that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We are subject to many different forms of taxation in both the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions where we operate, such as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law in December 2017. The new laws are still evolving and require we interpret the provisions of the law as we try to comply with them. The costs of compliance with these laws and regulations are high and are likely to increase in the future. Any failure on our part to comply with these laws and regulations can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort and may subject us to significant liabilities and other penalties.\n\ufeff\nWe have substantial short- to medium-term debt. Generally speaking, we have historically financed our operations through relatively short-term debt. No assurances can be given that we will be able to refinance this debt, or if we can, that the terms will be reasonable. However, as a counterbalance to this debt, we have certain unencumbered real property assets, which could be sold to pay debt or encumbered to assist in the refinancing of existing debt, if necessary.\n\ufeff\nWe have substantial lease liabilities. Most of our cinemas operate in leased facilities. These leases typically have \u201ccost of living\u201d or other rent adjustment features and require that we operate the properties as cinemas. A downturn in our cinema exhibition business might, depending on its severity, adversely affect the ability of our cinema operating subsidiaries to meet these rental obligations. Even if our cinema exhibition business remains relatively constant, cinema level cash flow will likely be adversely affected unless we can increase our revenue sufficiently to offset increases in our rental liabilities.\n\ufeff\nOur stock is thinly traded. Our stock is thinly traded, with an average daily volume in 2019 of only approximately 37,416 Class A Stock. Our Class B Stock is very thinly traded with even less volume. This can result in significant volatility, as demand by buyers and sellers can easily get out of balance.\n\ufeff\nOwnership and Management Structure, Corporate Governance, and Change of Control Risks\n\ufeff\nOngoing disputes among the heirs of James J. Cotter, Sr., over the past five years have caused, and may continue to cause, uncertainty regarding the ongoing control of the Company by the Cotter family and have distracted and may continue to distract the time and attention of our officers and directors from our business and operations and may ultimately interfere with the effective management of the Company. Up until his death on September 13, 2014, James J. Cotter, Sr., the father of Ellen Cotter, James J. Cotter, Jr. and Margaret Cotter, was our controlling stockholder, having the sole power to vote approximately 66.9% of the outstanding Class B Voting Common Stock (the \u201cClass B Stock\u201d) of the Company. Under applicable Nevada Law, a stockholder holding two-thirds of the Company\u2019s Class B Stock has the power at any time, with or without cause, to remove any one or more\n- 24 -\ndirectors (up to and including the entire board of directors) by written consent taken without a meeting of the stockholders. Over the past four years there have been a variety of disputes between Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter, on one side, and James J. Cotter, Jr., on the other side, as to the control and disposition of this Class B Stock.\n\ufeff\nImmediately following his death, the above referenced Class B Stock was beneficially owned by the Estate of James J. Cotter (the \u201cCotter Estate\u201d) which held 427,808 shares, representing 25.5% of such voting stock, and by the Living Trust established by the Declaration of Trust dated June 5, 2013, by James J. Cotter, Sr. (as amended, the \u201cCotter Trust\u201d) which held 696,080 shares, representing 41.4% of such voting stock. We are advised, based upon public filings made by one or more of Ellen Cotter, Margaret Cotter and James J. Cotter, Jr. (the \u201cCotter Filings\u201d) that the Class B Stock currently held of record by the Cotter Estate will eventually pour over into the Cotter Trust. We are further advised from the Cotter Filings that the Cotter Trust also provides for the establishment of a voting trust (the \u201cCotter Voting Trust\u201d) which will eventually hold the Class B Stock currently held by the Cotter Estate and the Cotter Trust.\n\ufeff\nOn December 22, 2014, the District Court of Clark County, Nevada, (the \u201cNevada District Court\u201d) appointed Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter as co-executors of the Cotter Estate. The Will of James J. Cotter provides that, after the payment of certain debts, the residual of his estate was to flow over into the Cotter Trust. However, a dispute arose between Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter, on one side, and James J. Cotter, Jr., on the other side, as to which trust document controlled the Cotter Trust and the designation of the trustees thereunder. On March 23, 2018, the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles (the \u201cCalifornia Superior Court\u201d), issued its judgement in the case captioned In re James J. Cotter Living Trust dated August 1, 2000 (Case No. BP159755) (the \u201cTrust Case\u201d), to the effect that Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter are the Co-Trustees of the Cotter Trust and that Margaret Cotter is the sole Trustee of the Voting Trust. As the appeal period for that judgment has expired, the California Superior Court\u2019s determination in this regard is now final and not subject to review. Accordingly, in the view of the Company, Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter have voting control over the shares held by the Cotter Trust and the Cotter Estate, collectively representing 66.9% of our Company\u2019s Class B Stock. Taking into account Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter\u2019s personal holdings of Class B Stock, Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter have the power to vote 71.9% of our Company\u2019s Class B Stock. In so far as we are aware, based upon public filings and our internal records, at the present time the Voting Trust does not own any shares of Class B Stock. The shares which are anticipated to flow into the Voting Trust are, insofar as our Company is aware, currently owned by the Cotter Estate and the Cotter Trust.\n\ufeff\nHowever, issues as to the ongoing control of our Company are still uncertain. James J. Cotter, Jr., has a motion pending since August 2015 to remove Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter as trustees of the Cotter Trust (a motion for which no discovery schedule, briefing schedule or hearing date has been set). Also, James J. Cotter, Jr., continues to support a motion brought by the guardian ad litem (the \u201cGAL\u201d) appointed by the Superior Court to represent the interests of the beneficiaries of the Voting Trust to effect a sale of the Voting Stock to be held by the Voting Trust.\n\ufeff\nThe GAL has motions pending (i) to divide the Voting Trust into separate trusts, one for the benefit of Margaret Cotter\u2019s children and one for the benefit of James J. Cotter, Jr.\u2019s children, (ii) in order to achieve diversification of the assets of these trusts, to sell the Class B stock eventually to be held by these trusts, and (iii) to immediately retain a valuation expert to advise him as to value of the Class B Voting Stock to be eventually held by the Voting Trust. A motion brought by Margaret Cotter and Ellen Cotter, as Co-Trustees of the Cotter Trust, to disqualify the GAL on the basis that he cannot simultaneously represent the interests of Margaret Cotter and James J. Cotter\u2019s, Jr\u2019s, children as the interests of those children differ, was denied by the Superior Court. Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter, as Co-Trustees of the Living Trust have advised that they believe that it was the intention of their father that the Class B Voting Stock be held in the Voting Trust as long as possible and that they intend to oppose any splitting of the Voting Trust and/or sale of the Class B Voting Stock eventually to be held by the Voting Trust.\n\ufeff\nWe understand from public filings made by Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter and public filings made by James J. Cotter, that James J. Cotter, Jr. is the first alternate trustee of the Voting Trust, in the event that Margaret Cotter is unable or unwilling to serve as trustee.\n\ufeff\nWhile our Company is not a party to the Trust Case, our Company has appeared in court, to protect (a) the business plan adopted by our Board of Directors and its determination that stockholder interests are best achieved by continuing with that business plan rather than selling the Company at this time and (b) in the event that the California Court were to disregard the advice of our Board and order that a controlling interest in our Company be marketed or sold, that the interests of our Company and stockholders generally are protected in the context of any such change of control transaction. Our Company\u2019s participation in the Trust Case since August 2017 has been overseen by a Special Independent Committee of the Board of Directors currently comprised of directors Doug McEachern and Judy Codding.\n\ufeff\nWe continue to believe that, whether or not a final determination is made to sell the voting shares, the very commencement of a process to sell a controlling interest in our Company would pose risks to our Company and our stockholders for a variety of reasons, including the resultant potential for: (i) distraction of management and key employees from focusing on the conduct of our business, including the implementation of our three year business strategy, (ii) incurrence of additional general and administrative costs due to the need to implement employee retention programs and to incur legal expenses of the type and at levels not typically required in the ordinary conduct of our Company\u2019s business, (iii) interference with contractual relationships, negotiations and potential negotiations\n- 25 -\nwith third parties important to our Company\u2019s business, including, without limitation, current and future lenders, tenants, landlords, suppliers and co-developers, (iv) increased difficulty in hiring and retaining high quality employees, and (v) exposure of our Company to potential litigation claims of the type which often accompany any extraordinary corporate transactions together with the expense, distraction and time loss that typically results from any such litigation. If a decision to sell a controlling interest is made by the California Superior Court, then there would be the additional risk that control might be sold to an unqualified purchaser who might exploit such control position in a manner not consistent with the best interests of our Company or stockholders generally.\n\ufeff\nThe California Superior Court, in the Trust Case, has jurisdiction over a potentially controlling block of our voting power. The Cotter Trust, which as described in more detail above, currently owns 41.4% of our Class B Stock, and, at such time as the Cotter Estate is probated, may receive up to an additional 25.5% of our Class B Stock, should the California Superior Court order the sale of the Trusts\u2019 Class B Stock and such sale be completed, then there may be a change of control of our Company (depending on, among other things, who the ultimate purchaser(s) of such shares might be, the number of shares of Class B Stock distributed by the Cotter Estate to the Cotter Trust, and whether the California Superior Court orders a sale of all or only some portion to the Class B Stock held by the Cotter Trust). We cannot predict what reactions, including appeals or other steps, might be taken by Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter in their respective capacities as Trustees under the Cotter Trust, or in other capacities (for example, as Co-Executors of the Cotter Estate or as stockholders acting in their own right), should the California Superior Court make such an order. We do note, however, that Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter have publicly stated that, if there is to be a sale of controlling shares, they intend to be the purchaser of such shares. We also cannot predict what action our Board of Directors would take in response, if any. However, our Board of Directors has an obligation to act in the best interest of our Company, and in the event the California Superior Court were to order a sale of the Class B Stock held by the Cotter Trust, our Board of Directors would be obligated to consider the interests of the Company and to act accordingly.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, James J. Cotter, Jr., filed a derivative action in 2015 against Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter and certain of our Directors, alleging a variety of misconduct on their part and, among other things, seeking the reinstatement of James J. Cotter, Jr. as president and chief executive officer of our Company, and challenging the voting by Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter of the shares held by the Cotter Estate. The Nevada District Court has now dismissed on summary judgment all of Mr. Cotter, Jr.\u2019s claims in that action, including his claims relating to the handling of the Patton Vision non-binding indications of interest. The Nevada District Court has also entered a cost order against Mr. Cotter, Jr., in the amount of $1.55 million. However, Mr. Cotter, Jr., has appealed those decisions so they continue as an overhang over our Company. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies - Cotter Jr. Related Litigation Matters (including legal costs coverage).\n\ufeff\nThe Nevada derivative litigation and related matters has for multiple years, required the time and attention of Ellen Cotter, Margaret Cotter, our directors and members of our management team and could, in the future, potentially further distract the time and attention of these key persons from the business and operations of our Company.\n\ufeff\nFurthermore, the uncertainty as to the future management and control of our Company could potentially adversely impact, among other things (i) our ability to develop and maintain favorable business relationships, (ii) our ability to attract and retain talented and experienced directors, executives and employees, (iii) the compensation and other terms needed to attract and retain such individuals (including, without limitation, the potential need for retentions agreements and other incentive arrangements typically put into place when control of a public company is uncertain), (iv) our ability to borrow money on favorable long-term terms, and (v) our ability to pursue and complete long-term business objectives.\n\ufeff\nThe interests of our controlling stockholder may conflict with your interests. As of December 31, 2019, the Cotter Estate and the Cotter Trust beneficially own 66.9% of our outstanding Class B Stock. At the present time, according to the books of the Company, Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter vote (including their direct holdings of 50,000 shares and 35,100 shares respectively of the Class B Stock), Class B Stock representing 71.9% of our outstanding Class B Stock. Our Class A Stock is non-voting, while our Class B Stock represents all of the voting power of our Company. For as long as the Cotter Estate, the Cotter Trust and/or the Cotter Voting Trust (referred to herein collectively as the \u201cCotter Entities\u201d) continue to own shares of Class B Stock representing more than 50% of the voting power of our common stock, the Cotter Entities will be able to elect all of the members of our Board of Directors and determine the outcome of all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, including matters involving mergers or other business combinations, the acquisition or disposition of assets, the incurrence of indebtedness, the issuance of any additional shares of common stock or other equity securities and the payment of dividends on common stock. The Cotter Entities will also have the power to prevent or cause a change in control and could take other actions that might be desirable to the Cotter Entities but not to other stockholders. To the extent that the Cotter Entities hold more than two-thirds of our outstanding Class B Stock, the Cotter Entities will have the power at any time, with or without cause, to remove any one or more Directors (up to and including the entire Board of Directors) by written consent taken without a meeting of the stockholders.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, the Cotter Estate or the Cotter Trust and/or their respective affiliates have controlling interests in companies in related and unrelated industries. In the future, we may participate in transactions with these companies (see Note 20 - Related Parties).\n\ufeff\n- 26 -\nWhile controlling stockholders may owe certain fiduciary duties to our Company and/or minority stockholders, these duties are limited. No assurances can be given that the Cotter Entities will not take action that, while beneficial to them and legally enforceable, would not necessarily be in the best interests of our Company and/or our stockholders generally.\n\ufeff\nWe are a \u201cControlled Company\u201d under applicable NASDAQ Regulations. As permitted by those Regulations, our Board has elected to opt-out of certain corporate governance rules applicable to non-controlled companies. Generally speaking, the NASDAQ requires listed companies to meet certain minimum corporate governance provisions. However, a \u201cControlled Company\u201d, such as we, may elect not to be governed by certain of these provisions. Our Board of Directors has elected to exempt our Company from requirements that (i) at least a majority of our Directors be independent and (ii) nominees to our Board of Directors be nominated by a committee comprised entirely of independent Directors or by a majority of our Company\u2019s independent Directors. Notwithstanding the determination by our Board of Directors to opt-out of these NASDAQ requirements, we believe that a majority of our Board of Directors is nevertheless currently comprised of independent Directors. As a practical matter, subject to their fiduciary duties, Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter control the composition of our Board of Directors.\n\ufeff\nWe depend on key personnel for our current and future performance. Our current and future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our senior management team and other key personnel. The loss or unavailability to us of any member of our senior management team or a key employee could significantly harm us. We cannot assure you that we would be able to locate or employ qualified replacements for senior management or key employees on acceptable terms. Due to the uncertainty of our control situation, the ongoing availability of these employees and our ability to replace them is uncertain.\n\ufeff\nIf our company suffers cybersecurity attacks, data security challenges or privacy incidents that result in security breaches, we could suffer a loss of sales, additional liability, reputational harm or other adverse consequences. The effective operation of our international businesses depends on our network infrastructure, computer systems, physical, virtual and/or cloud based, and software. Our information technology systems collect and process information provided by customers, employees and vendors. In addition, third-party vendors\u2019 systems process ticketing for our theaters. These various information technology systems and the data stored within them are subject to penetration by cyber attackers. We utilize industry accepted security protocols to securely maintain and protect proprietary and confidential information. However, in spite of our best efforts, our information systems may fail to operate for a variety of technological or human reasons. An interruption or failure of our information technology systems and of those maintained by our third-party providers could adversely affect our business, liquidity or results of operations and result in increases in reputational risk, litigation or penalties. Furthermore, any such occurrence, if significant could require us to expend resources to remediate and upgrade information technology systems. Since 2015, we have annually procured cybersecurity insurance to protect against cybersecurity risks; however, we cannot provide any assurance regarding the adequacy of such insurance coverage.", "PERMNO": 87533, "SIC": 7830, "TIC": "RDI"}
