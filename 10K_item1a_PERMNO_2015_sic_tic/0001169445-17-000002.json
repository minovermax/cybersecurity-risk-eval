Our business, financial condition, operating results, and stock price can be materially and adversely affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including, but not limited to, those described below. Any one or more of such factors could directly or indirectly cause our actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from our past or anticipated future financial condition or operating results.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY\nThere is significant uncertainty in the healthcare industry, both as a result of recently enacted legislation and changing government regulation, which may have a material adverse impact on the businesses of our hospital customers and ultimately on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe healthcare industry is subject to changing political, economic and regulatory influences that may affect the procurement processes and operation of healthcare facilities, including our hospital customers. During the past several years, the healthcare industry has been subject to an increase in governmental regulation of, among other things, reimbursement rates and certain capital expenditures.\nRecently enacted public laws reforming the U.S. healthcare system may have an impact on our business. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (H.R. 3590; Public Law 111-148) (the \"ACA\") and The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (H.R. 4872) (the \"Reconciliation Act\"), which amends the ACA (collectively the \"Health Reform Laws\"), were signed into law in March 2010. The Health Reform Laws contain various provisions which impact us and our customers. Some of these provisions have a positive impact, by expanding the use of electronic health records in certain federal programs, for example, while others, such as reductions in reimbursement for certain types of providers, have a negative impact due to fewer available resources. Increases in fraud and abuse penalties may also adversely affect participants in the healthcare sector, including us.\nAmong other things, the Health Reform Laws require nearly all individuals to have health insurance, provide for the expansion of Medicaid eligibility, mandate material changes to the delivery of healthcare services and reduce the reimbursement paid for such services in order to generate savings in the Medicare program. The Health Reform Laws also modify certain payment systems to encourage more cost-effective care and a reduction of inefficiencies and waste, including through new tools to address fraud and abuse.\nIt is likely that the Health Reform Laws will affect hospitals differently depending upon the populations they serve and their payor mix. Our target market of rural and community hospitals typically serve higher uninsured populations than larger urban hospitals and rely more heavily on Medicare and Medicaid for reimbursement. It remains to be seen whether the increase in the insured population for rural and community hospitals will be sufficient to offset actual and proposed additional cuts in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements contained in the Health Reform Laws.\nThe Health Reform Laws will ultimately lead to significant changes in the healthcare system. Because not all of the administrative rules implementing the Health Reform Laws have been finalized, and because of ongoing federal fiscal budgetary pressures yet to be resolved for federal health programs, the full impact of the legislation and of further statutory and regulatory actions to reform healthcare on our business is unknown, but there can be no assurances that the legislation will not adversely impact either our operational results or the manner in which we operate our business. Healthcare industry participants may respond to the Health Reform Laws by reducing their investments or postponing investment decisions, including investments in our solutions and services.\nVarious legislators have announced that they intend to examine further proposals to reform certain aspects of the U.S. healthcare system. Healthcare providers may react to these proposals, and the uncertainty surrounding such proposals, by curtailing or deferring investments, including those for our systems and related services. Cost-containment measures instituted by healthcare providers as a result of regulatory reform or otherwise could result in a reduction in the allocation of capital funds. Such a reduction could have an adverse effect on our ability to sell our systems and related services. On the other hand, changes in the regulatory environment have increased and may continue to increase the needs of healthcare organizations for cost-effective data management and thereby enhance the overall market for healthcare management information systems. We cannot predict what effect, if any, such additional proposals or healthcare reforms might have on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs existing regulations mature and become better defined, we anticipate that these regulations will continue to directly affect certain of our products and services, but we cannot fully predict the effect at this time. We have taken steps to modify our products, services and internal practices as necessary to facilitate our compliance with the regulations, but there can be no\nassurance that we will be able to do so in a timely or complete manner. Achieving compliance with these regulations could be costly and distract management\u2019s attention and divert other company resources, and any noncompliance by us could result in civil and criminal penalties.\nThe healthcare industry is heavily regulated at the local, state and federal levels. Our failure to comply with regulatory requirements could create liability for us, result in adverse publicity and negatively affect our business.\nThe healthcare industry is heavily regulated and is constantly evolving due to the changing political, legislative and regulatory landscapes. In some instances, the impact of these regulations on our business is direct to the extent that we are subject to these laws and regulations ourselves. However, these regulations also impact our business indirectly as, in a number of circumstances, our solutions, devices and services must be capable of being used by our customers in a way that complies with those laws and regulations, even though we may not be directly regulated by the specific healthcare laws and regulations. There is a significant number of wide-ranging regulations, including regulations in the areas of healthcare fraud, e-prescribing, claims processing and transmission, medical devices, the security and privacy of patient data, the ARRA meaningful use program, and interoperability standards, that may be directly or indirectly applicable to our operations and relationships or the business practices of our customers. Specific areas that are subject to increased regulation include, but are not limited to, the following:\nHealthcare Fraud. Federal and state governments continue to enhance regulation of and increase their scrutiny over practices potentially involving healthcare fraud, waste and abuse by healthcare providers whose services are reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid and other government healthcare programs. Our healthcare provider customers are subject to laws and regulations regarding fraud and abuse that, among other things, prohibit the direct or indirect payment or receipt of any remuneration for patient referrals, or arranging for or recommending referrals or other business paid for in whole or in part by these federal or state healthcare programs. Federal enforcement personnel have substantial funding, powers and remedies to pursue suspected or perceived fraud and abuse. The effect of this government regulation on our customers is difficult to predict. Many of the regulations applicable to our customers and that may be applicable to us, including those relating to marketing incentives offered in connection with medical device sales, are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts. They may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could broaden their applicability to us or require our customers to make changes in their operations or the way in which they deal with us. If such laws and regulations are determined to be applicable to us and if we fail to comply with any applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties, sanctions or other liabilities, including exclusion from government healthcare programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Even an unsuccessful challenge by a regulatory or prosecutorial authority of our activities could result in adverse publicity, could require a costly response from us and could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nE-Prescribing. The use of our solutions by physicians for electronic prescribing and electronic routing of prescriptions via the Surescripts network to pharmacies is governed by federal and state laws. States have differing regulations that govern the electronic transmission of certain prescriptions and prescription requirements. Standards adopted by the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs and regulations adopted by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\") related to \"EPrescribing and the Prescription Drug Program\" set forth implementation standards for the transmission of electronic prescriptions. These standards are detailed and broad, and cover not only routing transactions between prescribers and pharmacies, but also electronic eligibility, formulary and benefits inquiries. In general, regulations in this area can be burdensome and evolve regularly, meaning that any potential benefits to our customers from utilizing such solutions and services may be superseded by a newly-promulgated regulation that adversely affects our business model. Our efforts to provide solutions that enable our customers to comply with these regulations could be time consuming and expensive.\nClaims Processing and Transmission. Our system electronically transmits medical claims by physicians to patients\u2019 payors for immediate approval and reimbursement. In addition, we offer business management services that include the manual and electronic processing and submission of medical claims by healthcare providers to patients\u2019 payors for approval and reimbursement. Federal and state laws provide that it is a violation for any person to submit, or cause to be submitted, a claim to any payor, including, without limitation, Medicare, Medicaid and all private health plans and managed care plans, seeking payment for any service or product that overbills or bills for items that have not been provided to the patient. We have in place policies and procedures that we believe assure that all claims that are transmitted by our system and through our services are accurate and complete, provided that the information given to us by our customers is also accurate and complete. If, however, we do not follow those procedures and policies, or they are not sufficient to prevent inaccurate claims from being submitted, we could be subject to substantial liability including, but not limited to, civil and criminal liability. Additionally, any such failure of our billing and collection services to comply with these laws and regulations could adversely affect demand for our services and could force us to expend significant capital, research and development, and other resources to address the failure.\nIn most cases where we are permitted to do so, we calculate charges for our billing and collection services based on a percentage of the collections that our customers receive as a result of our services. To the extent that violations or liability for violations of these laws and regulations require intent, it may be alleged that this percentage calculation provides us or our employees with incentive to commit or overlook fraud or abuse in connection with submission and payment of reimbursement claims. CMS has stated that it is concerned that percentage-based billing services may encourage billing companies to commit or to overlook fraudulent or abusive practices.\nA portion of our business involves billing Medicare claims on behalf of our clients. In an effort to combat fraudulent Medicare claims, the federal government offers rewards for reporting of Medicare fraud which could encourage others to subject us to a charge of fraudulent claims, including charges that are ultimately proved to be without merit.\nAs discussed below, the HIPAA security and privacy standards also affect our claims transmission services, since those services must be structured and provided in a way that supports our customers\u2019 HIPAA compliance obligations.\nRegulation of Medical Devices. The United States Food and Drug Administration (the \"FDA\") has determined that certain of our solutions, such as our ImageLink\u00ae product, are medical devices that are actively regulated under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended. If other of our solutions are deemed to be actively regulated medical devices by the FDA, we could be subject to extensive requirements governing pre- and post-marketing activities including pre-market notification clearance. Complying with these medical device regulations is time consuming and expensive, and our marketing and other sales activities could be subject to unanticipated and significant delays. Further, it is possible that the FDA may become more active in regulating software and medical devices that are used in the healthcare industry. If we are unable to obtain the required regulatory approvals for any such software or medical devices, our short- to long-term business plans for these solutions or medical devices could be delayed or canceled and we could face FDA refusal to grant pre-market clearance or approval of products; withdrawal of existing clearances and approvals; fines, injunctions or civil penalties; recalls or product corrections; production suspensions; and criminal prosecution. FDA regulation of our products could increase our operating costs, delay or prevent the marketing of new or existing products, and adversely affect our revenue growth.\nSecurity and Privacy of Patient Information. Federal, state and local laws regulate the privacy and security of patient records and the circumstances under which those records may be released. These regulations govern both the disclosure and use of confidential patient medical record information and require the users of such information to implement specified security and privacy measures. United States regulations currently in place governing electronic health data transmissions continue to evolve and are often unclear and difficult to apply.\nIn the United States, HIPAA regulations require national standards for some types of electronic health information transactions and the data elements used in those transactions, security standards to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of health information, and standards to protect the privacy of individually identifiable health information. Covered entities under HIPAA, which include healthcare organizations such as our customers, and our claims processing, transmission and submission services, are required to comply with the privacy standards, transaction regulations and security regulations. Moreover, HITECH and associated regulatory requirements extend many of the HIPAA obligations, formerly imposed only upon covered entities, to business associates as well. As a business associate of our customers who are covered entities, we were in most instances already contractually required to ensure compliance with the HIPAA regulations as they pertain to the handling of covered customer data. However, the extension of these HIPAA obligations to business associates by law has created additional liability risks related to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information.\nEvolving HIPAA and HITECH-related laws or regulations could restrict the ability of our customers to obtain, use or disseminate patient information. This could adversely affect demand for our solutions and devices if they are not re-designed in a timely manner in order to meet the requirements of any new interpretations or regulations that seek to protect the privacy and security of patient data or enable our customers to execute new or modified healthcare transactions. We may need to expend additional capital and software development and other resources to modify our solutions to address these evolving data security and privacy issues. Furthermore, our failure to maintain the confidentiality of sensitive personal information in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements could damage our reputation and expose us to claims, fines and penalties.\nFederal and state statutes and regulations have granted broad enforcement powers to regulatory agencies to investigate and enforce compliance with these privacy and security laws and regulations. Federal and state enforcement personnel have substantial funding, powers and remedies to pursue suspected or perceived violations. If we fail to comply with any applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to civil penalties, sanctions or other liability. Enforcement investigations, even if meritless, could have a negative impact on our reputation, cause us to lose existing customers or limit our ability to attract new customers.\nARRA Meaningful Use Program. Various federal and state government agencies are developing standards that could become mandatory for systems purchased by entities that are funded by these agencies. For example, the ARRA requires \"meaningful use of certified electronic health record technology\" by healthcare providers by 2015 in order to receive incentive payments and avoid related reduced reimbursement rates for Medicare claims. Regulations have been issued that identify standards and implementation specifications and establish the certification standards for qualifying EHR technology. Nevertheless, these standards and specifications are subject to interpretation by the entities designated to certify such technology. While a combination of our solutions has been certified as meeting both stage one and stage two standards for certified electronic health record technology, the regulatory standards to achieve certification will continue to evolve over time. We may incur increased development costs and delays in delivering solutions if we need to upgrade our software or healthcare devices to be in compliance with these varying and evolving standards. In addition, delays in interpreting these standards may result in postponement or cancellation of our customers\u2019 decisions to purchase our software solutions. If our software solutions are not compliant with these evolving standards, our market position and sales could be impaired and we may have to invest significantly in changes to our software solutions.\nInteroperability Standards. Our customers are concerned with and often require that our software and systems be interoperable with other third party healthcare information technology systems. Market forces or governmental or regulatory authorities could create software interoperability standards that would apply to our software and systems, and if our software and systems are not consistent with those standards, we could be forced to incur substantial additional development costs. For example, the HITECH Act contains interoperability standards that healthcare providers are required to adhere to in order to receive stimulus funds from the federal government under the ARRA. Compliance with these and related standards is becoming a competitive requirement and, although a combination of our solutions has been certified as meeting all such required interoperability standards to date, maintaining such compliance with these varying and evolving rules may result in increased development costs and delays in upgrading our customer software and systems. To the extent these rules are narrowly construed, subsequently changed or supplemented, or that we are delayed in achieving certification under these evolving rules for applicable products, our customers may postpone or cancel their decisions to purchase or implement our software and systems.\nAs it relates specifically to interoperability, during 2013 we announced our membership in CommonWell Health Alliance (\"CommonWell\"), a not-for-profit trade association comprised of healthcare information technology vendors devoted to the notion that patient data should be safely, securely and immediately available to patients and healthcare providers to support better care delivery, regardless of where that care occurs. CommonWell is committed to fostering standards that make this possible, and to having healthcare information technology companies embed these capabilities natively and cost effectively into their EHR systems. Despite our membership in CommonWell, there is no guarantee that we will successfully manage the interoperability of our software and systems with third-party health IT providers.\nStandards for Submission of Healthcare Claims. CMS has mandated the use of new patient codes for reporting medical diagnosis and inpatient procedures, referred to as the ICD-10 codes. CMS is requiring all providers, payors, clearinghouses and billing services to utilize these ICD-10 codes when submitting claims for payment. ICD-10 codes will affect medical diagnosis and inpatient procedure coding for everyone covered by HIPAA, not just those who submit Medicare or Medicaid claims. Claims for services provided on or after October 1, 2015 must use ICD-10 codes for medical diagnosis and inpatient procedures or they will not be paid. While we have successfully implemented the use of ICD-10 codes within our products and services, the possibility exists for similar future mandates by CMS. If our products and services do not accommodate CMS mandates at any future date, customers may cease to use those products and services that are not compliant and may choose alternative vendors and products that are compliant. This could adversely impact future revenues.\nEconomic, market and other factors may cause a decline in spending for information technology and services by our current and prospective customers which may result in less demand for our products, lower prices and, consequently, lower revenues and a lower revenue growth rate.\nThe purchase of our information system involves a significant financial commitment by our customers. At the same time, the healthcare industry faces significant financial pressures that could adversely affect overall spending on healthcare information technology and services. For example, the recent economic recession and continued decrease in availability of credit, combined with actual and potential reductions in federal and state funding for Medicare and Medicaid, has caused hospitals to reduce, eliminate or postpone information technology related and other spending. To the extent spending for healthcare information technology and services declines or increases slower than we anticipate, demand for our products and services, as well as the prices we charge, could be adversely affected. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to increase or maintain our revenues or our revenue growth rate.\nThere are a limited number of hospitals in our target market. Saturation or consolidation in the healthcare industry could result in the loss of existing customers, a reduction in our potential customer base and downward pressure on the prices of our products and services.\nThe limited number of hospitals with 300 or fewer acute care beds in our general target market for our acute care product and service offerings, coupled with the accelerated adoption of EHRs resulting from the ARRA's EHR incentive program, has resulted in an ever narrowing market for new system installations which could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe have identified opportunities for continued growth and expansion in the form of (1) an expanded replacement market for EHRs as certain existing EHR vendors have struggled and are expected to continue to struggle with the expanding requirements of the ARRA's EHR adoption program, (2) selective expansion into English-speaking international markets, and (3) targeted expansion of the footprint for our ambulatory solutions by aggressively targeting physician practices in those communities where the local hospital is a current CPSI customer. Although we have formulated strategic responses for capitalizing on each of the identified opportunities, there is no guarantee that such responses will ultimately prove successful. Additionally, to the extent that these opportunities fail to develop or develop more slowly than expected, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely impacted.\nFurthermore, many healthcare providers have consolidated to create larger healthcare delivery enterprises with greater market power. If this consolidation continues, we could lose existing customers and could experience a decrease in the number of potential purchasers of our products and services. The loss of existing and potential customers due to industry consolidation could cause our revenue growth rate to decline.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMPANY\nVolatility in and disruption to the global capital and credit markets and tightened lending standards may adversely affect our ability to access credit in the future, the cost of any credit obtained in the future, and the financial soundness of our customers and our business.\nDomestic and international events during the last several years have resulted in volatility and disruption to the global capital and credit markets, manifested in the bankruptcy or restructuring of certain financial institutions and reduced lending activity by other financial institutions. Although certain indices and economic data have shown signs of stabilization in the United States and certain global markets, there can be no assurance that these improvements will be broad-based or sustainable. Continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect the availability, terms and cost of credit in the future. Although we believe that our operating cash flow and financial assets will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future, there can be no assurance that the continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase the costs of any future borrowing.\nOur business could also be negatively impacted to the extent that our hospital customers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets, the recent economic recession or cuts in Medicare and Medicaid funding. As a result, hospitals may modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase our software systems or services. Additionally, if hospitals\u2019 operating and financial performance deteriorates, or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit, they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable owed to us. Any inability of customers to pay us for our products and services may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow.\nTightened lending standards and the absence of third-party credit has resulted in many of our hospital customers seeking financing arrangements from us to purchase our software systems and services. These financing arrangements impact our short-term operating cash flow and cash available. Should the requests for these financing arrangements continue or increase, our business could be negatively impacted by our inability to finance these arrangements. In addition, the absence of credit could negatively impact our existing financing receivables should our customers with financing arrangements be unable to meet their obligations.\nOur substantial indebtedness may adversely affect our available cash flow and our ability to operate our business, remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on our indebtedness.\nIn connection with the acquisition of HHI we incurred substantial indebtedness. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $155.7 million of indebtedness, which includes $121.9 million under our Term Loan Facility and $33.0 million borrowed under our Revolving Credit Facility. We also have $17.0 million of unused commitments under our Revolving Credit Facility.\nOur substantial indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay, when due, the principal of, interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness. Our substantial indebtedness, combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments, could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, and any failure to comply with the obligations under any of our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default under such instruments;\n\u2022\nmake us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less highly leveraged and therefore able to take advantage of opportunities that our indebtedness prevents us from exploiting; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy or other purposes.\nAny of the above listed factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, our interest expense could increase if interest rates increase because our debt bears interest at floating rates, which could adversely affect our cash flows. If we do not have sufficient earnings to service our debt, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell assets, borrow more money or sell securities, none of which we can guarantee we will be able to do.\nIn addition, the Credit Agreement governing our Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility contains restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. A breach of any of these restrictive covenants, if not cured or waived, could result in an event of default that could trigger acceleration of our indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of or default under any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. The Credit Agreement requires compliance with a consolidated leverage ratio test. In addition, the Credit Agreement requires prepayment of the outstanding indebtedness thereunder if we have certain excess cash flow, as described therein. The Credit Agreement requires us to mandatorily prepay the Term Loan Facility and amounts borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility with net cash proceeds from certain financing and other transactions and beginning with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016, 50% of excess cash flow (minus certain specified other payments), subject to a step down based on our consolidated leverage ratio.\nDespite our current indebtedness levels, we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt, which could exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial leverage.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, including secured indebtedness. Although the Credit Agreement governing our Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If new debt is added to our or our subsidiaries\u2019 current debt levels, the related risks that we face would be increased.\nTo service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control, and any failure to meet our debt service obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur ability to pay interest on and principal of our debt obligations principally depends upon our operating performance. As a result, prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, will affect our ability to make these payments.\nIf we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy our debt service obligations, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital investments or capital expenditures or seeking to raise additional capital. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt, if at all, will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our\ndebt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, or to refinance our obligations at all or on commercially reasonable terms, could affect our ability to satisfy our debt obligations and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe terms of the Credit Agreement governing our Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to take certain actions.\nOur Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility contain, and any future indebtedness of ours would likely contain, a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating restrictions, including restrictions on our ability to engage in acts that may be in our best long-term interests.\nThe Credit Agreement governing our Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility includes covenants restricting, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022incur additional debt;\n\u2022incur liens and encumbrances;\n\u2022pay dividends on our equity securities or payments to redeem, repurchase or retire our equity securities;\n\u2022enter into restrictive agreements;\n\u2022make investments, loans and acquisitions;\n\u2022merge or consolidate with any other person;\n\u2022dispose of assets;\n\u2022enter into sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022engage in transactions with our affiliates; and\n\u2022materially alter the business we conduct.\nThe operating restrictions and covenants in these debt agreements and any future financing agreements may adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, and any material deviations from our forecasts could require us to seek waivers or amendments of covenants, alternative sources of financing or reductions in expenditures. In addition, the outstanding indebtedness under our Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility is, subject to certain exceptions, secured by security interests in substantially all of our and the subsidiary guarantors\u2019 tangible and intangible assets (subject to certain exceptions). A breach of any of the restrictive covenants in the Credit Agreement governing our Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility would result in a default, and our lenders may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable, or enforce and foreclose on their security interest and liquidate some or all of such pledged assets. The lenders under our Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings.\nWe are exposed to market risk related to interest rate changes.\nWe are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates as a result of the floating interest rates applicable to the outstanding debt under our Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility. The interest rate for the outstanding debt under our Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2016 was 3.875%. Borrowings under our Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a base rate, a LIBOR rate, or a combination of the two, as elected by us, plus an applicable margin. The base rate is determined by reference to the greatest of (a) the prime lending rate of Regions Bank, (b) the federal funds rate for the relevant interest period plus one half of one percent per annum and (c) the one month LIBOR rate plus one percent per annum. The LIBOR rate is determined by reference to the interest rate for dollar deposits in the London interbank market for the interest period relevant to such borrowings, adjusted as set forth in the Credit Agreement. There is no cap on the maximum interest rate for borrowings under our Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility.\nIf we cannot integrate our recent acquisition of Healthland Holding Inc. successfully, our business and prospects could be adversely affected.\nIn January 2016, we completed our acquisition of Healthland Holding Inc. (\u201cHHI\u201d). The success of the acquisition will depend significantly on how quickly and efficiently we are able to integrate HHI with our business. Integration of a substantial business is a challenging, time-consuming and costly process and involves numerous risks, including difficulties in the assimilation of operations, services, solutions and personnel, the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns, the expansion into markets in which we have little or no direct prior experience, and the potential inability to maintain the goodwill of existing clients. Potential difficulties that we may encounter as part of the integration process, which may preclude us from fully realizing the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, including the anticipated synergies, growth opportunities and costs savings, include, among other factors:\n\u2022\nmanaging a larger company;\n\u2022\nthe possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process, including known and unknown liabilities in the HHI business or arising out of the integration, or assumptions around client retention;\n\u2022\nintegrating two business cultures;\n\u2022\ncreating uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems and minimizing the costs associated with such matters;\n\u2022\nintegrating information systems, purchasing, accounting, finance, legal, sales, billing, payroll, and regulatory compliance functions;\n\u2022\npreserving client, supplier, product development, distribution, marketing, promotion and other important relationships;\n\u2022\ncommercializing \"go forward\" solutions under development and increasing revenues from existing marketed solutions;\n\u2022\ncombining the sales force territories and competencies associated with the sale of solutions and services presently sold or provided by legacy CPSI or HHI;\n\u2022\nintegrating personnel from different businesses while maintaining focus on providing consistent, high quality solutions and client support and attracting prospective clients;\n\u2022\nintegrating complex technologies and solutions from different businesses in a manner that is seamless to clients, and\n\u2022\nperformance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management's attention to the integration of HHI.\nIf management is unable to successfully integrate HHI in a manner that permits us to achieve the cost savings and operating synergies anticipated to result from the HHI acquisition, such anticipated benefits may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. The significant diversion of our management's attention away from the ongoing businesses, and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process, could adversely affect our financial results. Moreover, the failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of HHI acquisition could result in material increases in costs or material decreases in the amount of expected revenues. Any of the above difficulties could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, partners, suppliers and associates or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the HHI acquisition, or could reduce our earnings or otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may engage in future acquisitions. Such strategic acquisitions may be expensive, time consuming, and subject to other inherent risks which may jeopardize our ability to realize anticipated benefits.\nWe may acquire additional businesses, technologies and products if we determine that these additional businesses, technologies and products are likely to serve our strategic goals. Acquisitions, including the HHI acquisition, have inherent risks, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results or prospects, including, but not limited to the following:\n\u2022\nsignificant acquisition and integration costs;\n\u2022\nfailure to achieve projected synergies and performance targets;\n\u2022\npotentially dilutive issuances of our securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and amortization expenses related to intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition;\n\u2022\nusing cash as acquisition currency may adversely affect interest or investment income, which may in turn adversely affect our earnings and/or earnings per share;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in fully or effectively integrating the acquired technologies, software products, services, business practices or personnel, which would prevent us from realizing the intended benefits of the acquisition;\n\u2022\nfailure to maintain uniform standard controls, policies and procedures across acquired businesses;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in predicting and responding to issues related to product transition such as development, distribution and customer support;\n\u2022\nthe possible adverse effect of such acquisitions on existing relationships with third party partners and suppliers of technologies and services;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that staff or customers of the acquired companies might not accept new ownership and may transition to different technologies or attempt to renegotiate contract terms or relationships, including maintenance or support agreements;\n\u2022\nthe assumption of known and unknown liabilities;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that the due diligence process in any such acquisition may not completely identify material issues associated with product quality, product architecture, product development, intellectual property issues, key personnel issues or legal and financial contingencies, including any deficiencies in internal controls and procedures and the costs associated with remedying such deficiencies;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in entering geographic and/or business markets in which we have no or limited prior experience;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns; and\n\u2022\nthe possibility that acquired assets become impaired, requiring us to take a charge to earnings which could be significant.\nA failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses or technology in a timely manner could, for any of these reasons, have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. As a result, we may not be able to realize the expected benefits that we seek to achieve from the acquisitions, which could also affect our ability to service our debt obligations. In addition, we may be required to spend additional time or money on integration that otherwise would be spent on the development and expansion of our business.\nCompetition with companies that have greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we have could result in a loss of customers and/or a lowering of prices for our products, causing a decrease in our revenues and/or market share.\nOur principal competitors are Meditech and MEDHOST. Meditech and MEDHOST compete with us directly in our target market of rural and community hospitals with 300 or fewer acute care beds. These companies offer products and services that are comparable to our solutions and are designed to address the needs of rural and community hospitals.\nOur secondary competitors include McKesson Corporation, Epic Systems Corporation, Cerner Corporation, Quality Systems, Inc., Prognosis Health Information Systems LLC, and athenahealth, Inc. Most of these companies are significantly larger than we are, and they typically sell their products and services to larger hospitals outside of our target market. However, they sometimes compete directly with us. We also face competition from providers of practice management systems, general decision support and database systems and other segment-specific applications, as well as from healthcare technology consultants. Any of these companies, as well as other technology or healthcare companies, could decide at any time to specifically target hospitals within our target market.\nA number of existing and potential competitors are more established than we are and have greater name recognition and financial, technical and marketing resources. Products of our competitors may have better performance, lower prices and broader market acceptance than our products. We expect increased competition that could cause us to lose customers, lower our\nprices to remain competitive and, consequently, experience lower revenues, revenue growth and profit margins.\nOur failure to develop new products or enhance current products in response to market demands could adversely impact our competitive position and require substantial capital resources to correct.\nThe needs of hospitals in our target market are subject to rapid change due to government regulation, trends in clinical care practices and technological advancements. As a result of these changes, our products may quickly become obsolete or less competitive. New product introductions and enhancements by our competitors that more effectively or timely respond to changing industry needs may weaken our competitive position.\nWe continually redesign and enhance our products to incorporate new technologies and adapt our products to ever-changing hardware and software platforms. Often we face difficult choices regarding which new technologies to adopt. If we fail to anticipate or respond adequately to technological advancements, or experience significant delays in product development or introduction, our competitive position could be negatively affected. Moreover, our failure to offer products acceptable to our target market could require us to make significant capital investments and incur higher operating costs to redesign our products, which could negatively affect our financial condition and operating results.\nOur products assist clinical decision-making and related care by capturing, maintaining and reporting relevant patient data. If our products fail to provide accurate and timely information, our customers could assert claims against us that could result in substantial cost to us, harm our reputation in the industry and cause demand for our products to decline.\nWe provide products that assist clinical decision-making and related care by capturing, maintaining and reporting relevant patient data. Our products could fail or produce inaccurate results due to a variety of reasons, including mechanical error, product flaws, faulty installation and/or human error during the initial data conversion. If our products fail to provide accurate and timely information, customers and/or patients could sue us to hold us responsible for losses they incur from these errors. These lawsuits, regardless of merit or outcome, could result in substantial cost to us, divert management\u2019s attention from operations and decrease market acceptance of our products. We attempt to limit by contract our liability for damages arising from negligence, errors or mistakes. Despite this precaution, such contract provisions may not be enforceable or may not otherwise protect us from liability for damages. We maintain general liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors or omissions. However, this coverage may not be sufficient to cover one or more large claims against us or otherwise continue to be available on terms acceptable to us. In addition, the insurer could disclaim coverage as to any future claim.\nBreaches of security and viruses in our systems could result in customer claims against us and harm to our reputation causing us to incur expenses and/or lose customers.\nIn the course of our business operations, we compile and transmit confidential information, including patient health information. We have included security features in our systems that are intended to protect the privacy and integrity of this information. Despite the existence of these security features, our system may experience break-ins and similar disruptive problems that could jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through the information technology networks of our customers. In addition, the other systems with which we may interface, such as the Internet and related systems, may be vulnerable to security breaches, viruses, programming errors or similar disruptive problems. Because of the sensitivity of medical information, customers could sue us for breaches of security involving our system. Also, actual or perceived security breaches in our system could harm the market perception of our products which could cause us to lose existing and prospective customers. Additionally, the effect of security breaches and related issues could disrupt our ability to perform certain key business functions and could potentially reduce demand for our products and services. Accordingly, we have expended significant resources toward establishing and enhancing the security of our related infrastructures, although no assurance can be given that these systems will be entirely free from potential breach. Maintaining and enhancing our infrastructure security may require us to expend significant capital in the future.\nNew products that we introduce or enhancements to our existing products may contain undetected errors or problems that could affect customer satisfaction and cause a decrease in revenues.\nHighly complex software products such as ours sometimes contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced or when updates and new versions are released. Tests of our products may not detect bugs or errors because it is difficult to simulate our customers\u2019 wide variety of computing environments. Despite extensive testing, from time to time we have discovered defects or errors in our products. Defects or errors discovered in our products could cause delays in product introductions and shipments, result in increased costs and diversion of development resources, require design modifications, decrease market acceptance or customer satisfaction with our products, cause a loss of revenue, result in legal actions by our customers and cause increased insurance costs.\nOur facilities are located in an area vulnerable to hurricanes and tropical storms, and the occurrence of a severe hurricane, similar storm or other natural disaster could cause damage to our facilities and equipment, which could require us to cease or limit our operations.\nA significant portion of our facilities and employees are located within 30 miles of the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. Our facilities are vulnerable to significant damage or destruction from hurricanes and tropical storms. We are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters, including tornadoes, fires, floods and similar events. If any disaster were to occur, our ability to conduct business at our facilities could be seriously impaired or completely destroyed. This would have adverse consequences for our customers who depend on us for system support or business management, consulting and managed IT services. Also, the servers of customers who use our remote access services could be damaged or destroyed in any such disaster. This would have potentially devastating consequences to those customers. Although we have an emergency recovery plan, including back-up systems in remote locations, there can be no assurance that this plan will effectively prevent the interruption of our business due to a natural disaster. Furthermore, the insurance we maintain may not be adequate to cover our losses resulting from any natural disaster or other business interruption.\nInterruptions in our power supply and/or telecommunications capabilities could disrupt our operations, cause us to lose revenues and/or increase our expenses.\nWe currently have backup generators to be used as alternative sources of power in the event of a loss of power to our facilities. If these generators were to fail during any power outage, we would be temporarily unable to continue operations at our facilities. This would have adverse consequences for our customers who depend on us for system support, business management, and managed IT and professional services. Any such interruption in operations at our facilities could damage our reputation, harm our ability to retain existing customers and obtain new customers, and result in lost revenue and increased insurance and other operating costs.\nWe also have customers for whom we store and maintain computer servers containing critical patient and administrative data. Those customers access this data remotely through telecommunications lines. If our power generators fail during any power outage or if our telecommunications lines are severed or impaired for any reason, those customers would be unable to access their mission critical data causing an interruption in their operations. In such event our remote access customers and/or their patients could seek to hold us responsible for any losses. We would also potentially lose those customers, and our reputation could be harmed.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain qualified customer service and support personnel, our business and operating results will suffer.\nOur customer service and support is a key component of our business. Most of our hospital customers have small information technology staffs, and they depend on us to service and support their systems. Future difficulty in attracting, training and retaining capable customer service and support personnel could cause a decrease in the overall quality of our customer service and support. That decrease would have a negative effect on customer satisfaction which could cause us to lose existing customers and could have an adverse effect on our new customer sales. The loss of customers due to inadequate customer service and support would negatively impact our ability to continue to grow our business.\nWe do not have employment or non-competition agreements with most of our key personnel, and their departure could harm our future success.\nOur future success depends to a significant extent on the leadership and performance of our chief executive officer and other executive officers. We do not have employment or non-competition agreements with most of our executive officers. Therefore, they may terminate their employment with us at any time and may compete against us. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to manage our growth in the new markets we may enter, our business and financial results could suffer.\nOur future financial results will depend in part on our ability to profitably manage our business in new markets that we may enter. We are engaging in the strategic identification of, and competition for, growth and expansion opportunities in new markets or offerings. In order to successfully execute on these future initiatives, we will need to, among other things, manage changing business conditions and develop expertise in areas outside of our business's traditional core competencies. Difficulties in managing future growth in new markets could have a significant negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause we believe that proprietary rights are material to our success, misappropriation of these rights could limit our ability to compete effectively and adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe are heavily dependent on the maintenance and protection of our intellectual property and we rely largely on a combination of confidentiality provisions in our customer agreements, employee nondisclosure agreements, trademark and trade secret laws and other measures to protect our intellectual property. Additionally, our software is not patented or copyrighted. Although we attempt to control access to our intellectual property, unauthorized persons may attempt to copy or otherwise use our intellectual property. There can be no assurance that the legal protections and precautions we take will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or that competitors will not independently develop technologies equivalent or superior to ours. Monitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult, and the steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use. If our competitors gain access to our intellectual property, our competitive position in the industry could be damaged. An inability to compete effectively could cause us to lose existing and potential customers and experience lower revenues, revenue growth and profit margins. Third parties could obtain patents that may require us to negotiate licenses to conduct our business, and the required licenses may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. We also rely on nondisclosure agreements with certain employees, and we cannot be certain that these agreements will not be breached or that we will have adequate remedies for any breach.\nIf we are deemed to infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties, we could incur unanticipated expense and be prevented from providing our products and services if we cannot obtain licenses to these rights on commercially acceptable terms.\nWe do not believe that our operations or products infringe on the intellectual property rights of others. However, there can be no assurance that others will not assert infringement or trade secret claims against us with respect to our current or future products. Many participants in the technology industry have an increasing number of patents and patent applications and have frequently demonstrated a readiness to take legal action based on allegations of patent and other intellectual property infringement. Further, as the number and functionality of our products increase, we believe we may become increasingly subject to the risk of infringement claims. If infringement claims are brought against us, these assertions could distract management. We may have to spend a significant amount of money and time to defend or settle those claims. In addition, claims against third parties from which we purchase software could adversely affect our ability to access third-party software for our systems.\nIf we were found to infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, we could be forced to pay significant license fees or damages for infringement. If we were unable to obtain licenses to these rights on commercially acceptable terms, we would be required to discontinue the sale of our products that contain the infringing technology. Our customers would also be required to discontinue the use of those products. We are unable to insure against this risk on an economically feasible basis. Even if we were to prevail in an infringement lawsuit, the accompanying publicity could adversely impact the demand for our products. Under some circumstances, we agree to indemnify our customers for some types of infringement claims that may arise from the use of our products.\nWe face the risks and uncertainties that are associated with litigation against us, which may adversely impact our marketing, distract management and have a negative impact upon our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face the risks associated with litigation concerning the operation of our business. For example, companies in our industry, including many of our competitors, have been subject to litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In particular, patent holding companies often engage in litigation to seek to monetize patents that they have obtained. As the number of competitors, patents and patent holding companies in our industry increases, the functionality of our products and services expands, and we enter into new geographies and markets, the number of intellectual property rights-related actions against us is likely to continue to increase. The uncertainty associated with substantial unresolved litigation may have an adverse effect on our business. In particular, such litigation could impair our relationships with existing customers and our ability to obtain new customers. Defending such litigation may result in a diversion of management's time and attention away from business operations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Such litigation may also have the effect of discouraging potential acquirers from bidding for us or reducing the consideration such acquirers would otherwise be willing to pay in connection with an acquisition.\nThere can be no assurance that such litigation will not result in liability in excess of our insurance coverage, that our insurance will cover such claims or that appropriate insurance will continue to be available to us in the future at commercially reasonable rates.\nWe are dependent on the continued and unimpeded access to the Internet by us and our customers, which is not within our control.\nWe deliver Internet-based services and, accordingly, depend on our ability and the ability of our customers to access the Internet. This access is currently provided by third parties that have significant market power in the broadband and Internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone companies, cable companies, mobile communications companies and government-owned service providers - all of whom are outside of our control. In the event of any difficulties, outages and delays by Internet service providers, we may be impeded from providing services, resulting in a loss of potential or existing customers.\nWe may be subject to liability in the event we provide inaccurate claims data to payors.\nWe offer electronic claims submission services as part of our business management services. While we have implemented certain product features designed to maximize the accuracy and completeness of claims submissions, these features may not be sufficient to prevent inaccurate claims data from being submitted to payors. Should inaccurate claims data be submitted to payors, we may be subject to liability claims.\nWe are dependent on our licenses of rights, products and services from third parties, disruptions of which may cause us to discontinue, delay or reduce product shipments.\nWe are increasingly dependent upon licenses for some of the technology used in our products as well as other products and services from third-party vendors, and the costs of these licenses have increased in recent years. Most of these arrangements can be continued/renewed only by mutual consent and may be terminated for any number of reasons. We may not be able to continue using the technology, products or services made available to us under these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms or at all. As a result, we may have to discontinue, delay or reduce product shipments or services provided until we can obtain equivalent technology or services. Most of our third-party licenses are non-exclusive. Our competitors may obtain the right to use any of the business elements covered by these arrangements and use these elements to compete directly with us. In addition, if our vendors choose to discontinue providing their technology, products or services in the future or are unsuccessful in their continued research and development efforts, we may not be able to modify or adapt our own products.\nAs a result of the inherent limitations in our internal control over financial reporting, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file with or submit to the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d) is accumulated and communicated to management and recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. In addition, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by an unauthorized override of the controls.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nWe are subject to changes in and interpretations of financial accounting matters that govern the measurement of our performance, one or more of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, revenue and results of operations.\nBased on our reading and interpretations of relevant guidance, principles or concepts issued by, among other authorities, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission, we believe revenue received pursuant to our current sales and licensing contract terms and business arrangements have been properly recognized. However, there continue to be issued interpretations and guidance for applying the relevant standards to a wide range of sales and licensing contract terms and business arrangements that are prevalent in the software industry. Future interpretations or changes by the regulators of existing accounting standards or changes in our business practices could result in changes in our revenue recognition and/or other accounting policies and practices that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, revenue and results of operations.\nWe may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired.\nWe are required under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"U.S. GAAP\") to test our goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. Indicators that are considered include significant\nchanges in performance relative to expected operating results, significant changes in the use of the assets, significant negative industry, or economic trends, or a significant decline in the Company's stock price and/or market capitalization for a sustained period of time. In addition, we periodically review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable include slower growth rates, the loss of significant customers, or divestiture of a business or asset for less than its carrying value. We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets is determined. This could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. There are inherent uncertainties in management's estimates, judgments and assumptions used in assessing recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets. Any changes in key assumptions, including failure to meet business plans, a deterioration in the market, or other unanticipated events and circumstances, may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and could potentially result in an impairment charge.\nThe unpredictability of our quarterly operating results may cause us to fail to meet revenues or earnings expectations which could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate or decline.\nThere is no assurance that consistent quarterly growth in our business will occur. Our quarterly revenues may fluctuate and may be difficult to forecast for a variety of reasons. For example, prospective customers often take significant time evaluating our system and related services before making a purchase decision. Moreover, a prospective customer who has placed an order for our system could decide to cancel that order or postpone installation of the ordered system. If a prospective customer delays or cancels a scheduled system installation during any quarter, we may not be able to schedule a substitute system installation during that quarter. The amount of revenues that would have been generated from that installation will be postponed or lost. The possibility of delays or cancellations of scheduled system installations could cause our quarterly revenues to fluctuate.\nThe following factors may also affect demand for our products and services and cause our quarterly revenues to fluctuate:\n\u2022\nchanges in customer budgets and purchasing priorities;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our customers to obtain financing for the purchase of our products;\n\u2022\nthe financial stability of our customers;\n\u2022\nthe specific mix of software, hardware and services in orders from customers;\n\u2022\nthe timing of new product announcements and product introductions by us and our competitors;\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of new products, product enhancements and services from us and our competitors;\n\u2022\nproduct and price competition;\n\u2022\nour success in expanding our sales and marketing programs;\n\u2022\nthe availability and cost of system components;\n\u2022\ndelay of revenue recognition to future quarters due to an increase in the sales of our remote access SaaS services;\n\u2022\nthe length of sales cycles and installation processes;\n\u2022\nchanges in revenue recognition or other accounting guidelines employed by us and/or established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other rulemaking bodies;\n\u2022\naccounting policies concerning the timing of recognition of revenue;\n\u2022\npersonnel changes; and\n\u2022\ngeneral market and economic factors.\nVariations in our quarterly revenues may adversely affect our operating results. In each fiscal quarter, our expense levels, operating costs and hiring plans are based on projections of future revenues and are relatively fixed. Because a significant percentage of our expenses are relatively fixed, a variation in the timing of systems sales, implementations and installations can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter. As a result, we believe that interim period-to-period\ncomparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance. Further, our historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of future performance for any particular period.\nWe currently recognize revenue pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 985-605, Software, Revenue Recognition, or ASC 985-605. ASC 985-605 summarizes the FASB\u2019s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements. There can be no assurance that application and subsequent interpretations of this pronouncement will not further modify our revenue recognition policies, or that such modifications would not adversely affect our operating results reported in any particular quarter or year.\nDue to all of the foregoing factors, it is possible that our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In such event, the price of our common stock would likely be adversely affected.\nOur common stock price has periodically experienced significant volatility, which could result in substantial losses for investors purchasing shares of our common stock and in litigation against us.\nVolatility may be caused by a number of factors including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated quarterly variations in operating results;\n\u2022\nrumors about our performance, software solutions, or merger and acquisition activity;\n\u2022\nchanges in expectations of future financial performance or changes in estimates of securities analysts;\n\u2022\ngovernmental regulatory action;\n\u2022\nhealthcare reform measures;\n\u2022\ncustomer relationship developments;\n\u2022\npurchases or sales of Company stock;\n\u2022\nchanges occurring in the markets in general;\n\u2022\nmacroeconomic conditions, both nationally and internationally; and\n\u2022\nother factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nFurthermore, the stock market in general, and the market for software, healthcare and high technology companies in particular, has experienced significant volatility in recent years that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, regardless of actual operating performance.\nMoreover, in the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We may in the future be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources.\nIn our internal control over financial reporting, we identified a material weakness. If we fail to remedy this weakness or otherwise fail to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, this may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nWe are required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to furnish a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and to include a report by our independent auditors attesting to such effectiveness. Any failure by us to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect our ability to report accurately our financial condition or results of operations.\nAs discussed in this report under \"Controls and Procedures,\" our management concluded that, as of December 31, 2016, we had material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting related to our business combination processes. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We are actively remediating the identified material weakness, but no assurance can be given that such condition will be fully remedied in a timely fashion.\nIf we are unable to remediate this weakness, or otherwise to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent auditors determine that we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, also could restrict our future access to the capital markets.", "PERMNO": 89387, "SIC": 7373, "TIC": "CPSI"}
