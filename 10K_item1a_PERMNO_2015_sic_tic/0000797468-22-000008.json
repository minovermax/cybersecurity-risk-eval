RISK FACTORS\nRisks related to government regulations and the environment\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected our business and the ultimate effect on our operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic disrupted global supply chains and created significant volatility in the financial markets. While the worldwide economy continues to be impacted by the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and emergence and spread of new variants of the virus, demand for oil and gas products has increased with the lifting of certain restrictions, including certain travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders. Current crude oil, NGL and natural gas demand and prices could be negatively impacted by a resurgence of COVID-19 cases, slow vaccine distribution in certain large international economies or the recurrence or tightening of travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders. If reduced demand for and lower prices of crude oil, NGL and natural gas persist for a prolonged period, our operations, financial condition, cash flows, level of expenditures and the quantity of estimated proved reserves that may be attributed to our properties may be materially and adversely affected. Our operations also may be adversely affected if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work, or work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, government actions, vaccine mandates or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic. As a result of higher vaccination rates and lower infection rates in 2021 we lifted certain workplace restrictions implemented in the initial stages of the pandemic and implemented new workplace safety protocols and procedures in our offices and work sites to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19 amongst our workforce. We continue to monitor national, state and local government directives where we have operations and/or offices and have reinstituted a WFH schedule effective December 21, 2021, through March 1, 2022, for certain domestic office-based employees in light of the Omicron variant. Occidental has not experienced any significant disruptions as a result of any new COVID-19 variants. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic may also materially adversely affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not currently known to us or that we do not currently consider to present significant risks to our operations. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition and operating results, it may also have the effect of heightening the other risks described herein.\nGovernmental actions and political instability may affect Occidental\u2019s results of operations.\nOccidental\u2019s businesses are subject to the actions and decisions of many federal, state, local and international governments and political interests. As a result, Occidental faces risks of:\n\u25a0New or amended laws and regulations, or new or different applications or interpretations of existing laws and regulations, including those related to drilling, manufacturing or production processes (including flaring and well stimulation techniques such as hydraulic fracturing and acidization), pipelines, labor and employment, taxes, royalty rates, permitted production rates, entitlements, import, export and use of raw materials, equipment or products, use or increased use of land, water and other natural resources, air emissions, water recycling and disposal, waste minimization and disposal, safety, the manufacturing of chemicals, asset integrity management, the marketing or export of commodities, security, environmental protection, and climate change-related and sustainability initiatives, all of which may restrict or prohibit activities of Occidental or its contractors, increase Occidental\u2019s costs or reduce demand for Occidental\u2019s products. In addition, violation of certain governmental laws and regulations may result in strict, joint and several liability and the imposition of significant civil and criminal fines and penalties;\n\u25a0Refusal of, or delay in, the extension or grant of exploration, development or production contracts; and\n\u25a0Development delays and cost overruns due to approval delays for, or denial of, drilling, construction, environmental and other regulatory approvals, permits and authorizations.\nOXY 2021 FORM 10-K\nRISK FACTORS\nIn November 2021, Congress passed and President Biden signed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. This law reinstates the federal Superfund excise taxes on various chemicals that OxyChem manufactures. These excise taxes could lead to higher costs and impact margins.\nIn November 2021, the House of Representatives passed the Build Back Better Act (BBB), which contains several climate-related provisions. While the BBB was not enacted in 2021, renewed efforts are expected in 2022 to legislate BBB or portions thereof. Provisions, if any, that reduce demand for oil and gas could negatively affect Occidental\u2019s revenue.\nIn November 2021, the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) released its Report on the Federal Oil and Gas Leasing Program, recommending increasing royalty rates and rents for drilling programs on federal public lands and in federal offshore waters, in addition to prioritizing leasing in areas with known resource potential and in proximity to existing oil and gas infrastructure and avoiding leasing in areas with competing uses such as recreation, wildlife habitat, conservation and historical and cultural resources. If enacted, the regulations could increase royalties payable to the federal government and limit future potential drilling sites.\nIn January 2022, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued a decision to invalidate the results of Bureau of Ocean Energy Management\u2019s oil and gas lease sale in the Gulf of Mexico, of which Occidental was the high bidder on 30 additional new blocks located nearby to its existing host platforms, ruling that the environmental analysis of GHG emissions was inadequate under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The DOI, which oversees federal oil and gas development, is currently reviewing the decision. The decision does not affect Occidental\u2019s existing leases or operations, but restrictions or uncertainty regarding federal lease sales and associated NEPA requirements could impact the ability to develop resources in areas outside of existing leases.\nIn January 2021, the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (COGCC) adopted new regulations that impose siting requirements or \u201csetbacks\u201d on certain oil and gas drilling locations based on the distance of a proposed well pad to occupied structures. Pursuant to the regulations, well pads cannot be located within 500 feet of an occupied structure without the consent of the property owner. As part of the permitting process, the COGCC will consider a series of siting requirements for all drilling locations located between 500 feet and 2,000 feet of an occupied structure. Alternatively, the operator may seek a waiver from each owner and tenant within the designated distance. Occidental has a dedicated, multidisciplinary stakeholder relations team that conducts regulatory and community outreach with respect to its permit applications and operations in Colorado. While Occidental has not been denied any permits, and received its first approved Oil and Gas Development Plan permit under the new state regulations in the fourth quarter of 2021, any significant delays could result in changes to our development program in the DJ Basin and our ability to establish new proved undeveloped (PUD) locations by meeting the SEC\u2019s \u201creasonably certain\u201d threshold for adding PUD reserves.\nTexas and New Mexico have experienced an increase in seismic activity, with events measuring magnitude 3 or greater in each state. In the fourth quarter of 2021, both states issued new guidelines for operators to prevent or mitigate seismic activity, focused on produced water disposal wells. These guidelines also require operators to implement response plans for activities within agency-designated seismic response areas. These states have curtailed water disposal and suspended permits in seismic response areas, particularly in deep disposal wells. Occidental does not operate deep disposal wells in the seismic response areas established by the state agencies to date, and its shallow disposal wells have been authorized to operate at agency-approved volume limits. Occidental also has central water treatment and recycling facilities that reduce the need for disposal of produced water. While Occidental\u2019s ability to drill and complete wells or to dispose of surplus produced water has not been impacted by these seismic guidelines to date, increased seismicity, or regulatory responses to seismic events, could impact the location, timing and cost of Occidental\u2019s development program and existing operations in seismic response areas.\nIn addition, Occidental has experienced and may continue to experience adverse consequences, such as risk of loss or production limitations, because certain of its international operations are located in countries affected by political instability, nationalizations, corruption, armed conflict, terrorism, insurgency, civil unrest, security problems, labor unrest, Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) production restrictions, equipment import restrictions and sanctions. Exposure to such risks may increase if a greater percentage of Occidental\u2019s future oil and gas production or revenue comes from international sources.\nClimate change and further regulation of GHG and other air emissions may adversely affect Occidental\u2019s operations or results.\nContinuing political, social and industry attention to climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national, regional and local legislation and regulatory programs to reduce GHG emissions. In December 2009, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) determined that CO2, methane and other GHG emissions endanger public health and the environment because they contribute to warming of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA began adopting and implementing regulations to restrict GHG emissions under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act. The EPA issued regulations in 2012 and 2016 to address methane and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from certain new or modified oil and gas sources, the methane provisions of which were rescinded by the Trump Administration\u2019s 2020 methane policy rule. The Biden Administration has identified climate change as a priority and has identified a variety of avenues to prohibit or restrict oil and gas development activities in certain areas. In June 2021, Congress and President Biden rescinded the 2020 policy rule under the Congressional Review Act, reinstating the methane provisions of EPA\u2019s 2012 and 2016 regulations, an action that Occidental supported. In November 2021, the White House Office of Domestic Climate Policy issued a U.S. Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan that solicited public comment on the EPA\u2019s proposed framework for expanding federal regulations. The proposal would regulate\nOXY 2021 FORM 10-K\nRISK FACTORS\nmethane and VOC emissions from a broader set of new upstream and midstream operations, as well as various existing operations. The EPA is expected to issue proposed regulations in 2022 based on this framework.\nSeveral state governments have also established rules aimed at reducing GHG emissions, some including GHG cap and trade programs and others directly regulating equipment that emits GHG, including methane, and other compounds. Most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions, such as electric power plants, or major producers of fuels, including refineries and natural gas processing plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances. Other U.S. states where Occidental operates, including Colorado, New Mexico and Texas, adopted or proposed new regulations, policies or strategies in 2021 that increase inspection, recordkeeping, reporting, enforcement and controls on flaring, venting and equipment that emit methane and other compounds at oil and gas facilities. In certain instances, these states anticipate tying the processing and active status of oil and gas permits, including drilling permits, to air emissions and compliance. For example, Colorado has established GHG intensity targets for DJ Basin operators in 2025, 2027 and 2030, which Occidental currently meets.\nThese and other government actions relating to GHG and other air emissions could require Occidental to incur increased operating and maintenance costs including higher rates charged by service providers, costs to purchase, operate and maintain emissions control systems, to acquire emission allowances, pay carbon taxes or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements or prevent Occidental from conducting oil and gas development activities in certain areas, or they could promote the use of alternative sources of energy and thereby decrease demand for oil, NGL and natural gas and other products that Occidental\u2019s businesses produce. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, oil, NGL, natural gas or other products produced by Occidental\u2019s businesses and lower the value of its reserves. Consequently, government actions designed to reduce GHG emissions could have an adverse effect on Occidental\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and reserves.\nIt is difficult to predict the timing, certainty and scope of such government actions and their ultimate effect on Occidental, which could depend on, among other things, the type and extent of GHG emissions reductions required, the availability and price of emission allowances or credits, the availability and price of alternative fuel sources, the energy sectors covered and Occidental\u2019s ability to recover the costs incurred through its operating agreements or the pricing of its oil, NGL, natural gas and other products and whether service providers are able to pass increased costs through to Occidental.\nThere also have been efforts in the investment community, including investment advisers and certain sovereign wealth, pension and endowment funds, as well as political actors and other stakeholders, promoting divestment of fossil fuel equities, reducing access to capital markets and pressuring lenders to limit funding or increase the cost of lending to companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves. Additionally, institutional lenders who provide financing to oil and gas companies have become more attentive to sustainable lending practices, and some of them may substantially reduce, or elect not to provide, funding for oil and gas companies. Such environmental initiatives aimed at limiting climate change and reducing air pollution could adversely affect our business activities, operations and ability to access capital, and could cause the market value of our securities to decrease, our cost of capital to increase and adversely affect our reputation. Finally, increasing attention to climate change risks has resulted in an increased possibility of governmental investigations and additional private litigation against Occidental without regard to causation or our contribution to the asserted damage, which could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nOccidental\u2019s businesses may experience catastrophic events.\nThe occurrence of severe weather events such as hurricanes, floods, freezes and heat waves, droughts, earthquakes or other acts of nature, pandemics, well blowouts, fires, explosions, pipeline ruptures, chemical releases, oil releases, including maritime releases, releases into navigable waters and groundwater contamination, material or mechanical failure, power outages, industrial accidents, physical or cyber attacks, abnormally pressured or structured formations and other events that cause operations to cease or be curtailed may negatively affect Occidental\u2019s businesses and the communities in which it operates. Coastal operations are particularly susceptible to disruption from severe weather events. Any of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial losses to us as a result of:\n\u25a0Damage to and destruction of property and equipment, including property and equipment owned by third-parties which our operations rely upon;\n\u25a0Damage to natural resources;\n\u25a0Pollution and other environmental damage, including spillage or mishandling of recovered chemicals or fluids;\n\u25a0Regulatory investigations, fines and penalties;\n\u25a0Loss of well location, acreage, expected production and related reserves;\n\u25a0Suspension or delay of our operations;\n\u25a0Substantial liability claims; and\n\u25a0Significant repair and remediation costs that increase our break-even economics.\nThird-party insurance may not provide adequate coverage or Occidental may be self-insured with respect to the related losses. In addition, under certain circumstances, we may be liable for environmental damage caused by previous owners or operators of properties that we own, lease or operate. As a result, we may incur substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities for environmental matters for which we do not have insurance coverage, which could reduce or\nOXY 2021 FORM 10-K\nRISK FACTORS\neliminate funds available for exploration, development, acquisitions or other investments in our business, or cause us to incur losses.\nRisks related to Occidental\u2019s business and operations\nVolatile global and local commodity pricing strongly affect Occidental\u2019s results of operations.\nOccidental\u2019s financial results correlate closely to the prices it obtains for its products, particularly oil and, to a lesser extent, NGL, natural gas and its chemical products.\nPrices for oil, NGL and natural gas fluctuate widely. Historically, the markets for oil, NGL and natural gas have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. If the prices of oil, NGL or natural gas continue to be volatile or decline, Occidental\u2019s operations, financial condition, cash flows, level of expenditures and the quantity of estimated proved reserves that may be attributed to our properties may be materially and adversely affected. Prices are set by global and local market forces which are not in Occidental\u2019s control. These factors include, among others:\n\u25a0Worldwide and domestic supplies of, and demand for, oil, NGL, natural gas and refined products;\n\u25a0The cost of exploring for, developing, producing, refining and marketing oil, NGL, natural gas and refined products;\n\u25a0Operational impacts such as production disruptions, technological advances and regional market conditions, including available transportation capacity and infrastructure constraints in producing areas;\n\u25a0Changes in weather patterns and climate;\n\u25a0The impacts of the members of OPEC and other non-OPEC member-producing nations that may agree to and maintain production levels;\n\u25a0The worldwide military and political environment, including uncertainty or instability resulting from an escalation or outbreak of armed hostilities or acts of terrorism in the United States or elsewhere;\n\u25a0The price and availability of and demand for alternative and competing fuels and emissions reducing technology;\n\u25a0Technological advances affecting energy consumption and supply;\n\u25a0Government policies and support and market demand for low-carbon technologies;\n\u25a0Domestic and international governmental regulations and taxes, including those that restrict the export of hydrocarbons;\n\u25a0Shareholder activism or activities by non-governmental organizations to restrict the exploration, development and production of oil, NGL and natural gas;\n\u25a0Additional or increased nationalization and expropriation activities by international governments;\n\u25a0The impact and uncertainty of world health events, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the spread of new variants;\n\u25a0The effect of releases from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve;\n\u25a0Volatility in commodity markets;\n\u25a0The effect of energy conservation efforts; and\n\u25a0Global inventory levels and general economic conditions.\nThe long-term effects of these and other conditions on the prices of oil, NGL, natural gas and chemical products are uncertain and there can be no assurance that the demand or pricing for Occidental\u2019s products will follow historic patterns in the near-term. Prolonged or substantial decline, or sustained market uncertainty, in these commodity prices may have the following effects on Occidental\u2019s business:\n\u25a0Adversely affect Occidental\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to reduce debt, access to and cost of capital, and ability to finance planned capital expenditures, pay dividends and repurchase shares;\n\u25a0Reduce the amount of oil, NGL and natural gas that Occidental can produce economically;\n\u25a0Cause Occidental to delay or postpone some of its capital projects;\n\u25a0Reduce Occidental\u2019s revenues, operating income or cash flows;\n\u25a0Reduce the amounts of Occidental\u2019s estimated proved oil, NGL and natural gas reserves;\n\u25a0Reduce the carrying value of Occidental\u2019s oil and natural gas properties due to recognizing impairments of proved properties, unproved properties and exploration assets;\n\u25a0Reduce the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to oil, NGL and natural gas reserves; and\n\u25a0Adversely affect the ability of Occidental\u2019s partners to fund their working interest capital requirements.\nGenerally, Occidental\u2019s historical practice has been to remain exposed to the market prices of commodities. In 2019, Occidental entered into 2020 Brent-priced 3-way collars combined with 2021 call options on the same volume to manage its near-term exposure to cash flow variability from oil price risks in 2020. The 2021 call options were sold to enhance the upside retention in 2020. In 2020, management elected to hedge a portion of Occidental\u2019s expected 2021 natural gas production to enhance cash flow stability. As of December 31, 2021, there are no active commodity hedges in place.\nOXY 2021 FORM 10-K\nRISK FACTORS\nManagement may choose to put hedges in place in the future for oil, NGL and natural gas commodities. Commodity price risk management activities may prevent us from fully benefiting from price increases and may expose us to regulatory, counterparty credit and other risks.\nThe prices obtained for Occidental\u2019s chemical products correlate to the strength of the United States and global economies, as well as chemical industry expansion and contraction cycles. Occidental also depends on feedstocks and energy to produce chemicals, which are commodities subject to significant price fluctuations.\nOccidental may experience delays, cost overruns, losses or other unrealized expectations in development efforts and exploration activities.\nOil, NGL and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to numerous risks beyond our control, including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable oil, NGL and natural gas production. In its development and exploration activities, Occidental bears the risks of:\n\u25a0Equipment failures;\n\u25a0Construction delays;\n\u25a0Escalating costs or competition for services, materials, supplies or labor;\n\u25a0Property or border disputes;\n\u25a0Disappointing drilling results or reservoir performance;\n\u25a0Title problems and other associated risks that may affect its ability to profitably grow production, replace reserves and achieve its targeted returns;\n\u25a0Actions by third-party operators of our properties;\n\u25a0Permit delays and costs of drilling wells on lands subject to complex development terms and circumstances; and\n\u25a0Oil, NGL and natural gas gathering, transportation and processing availability, restrictions or limitations.\nExploration is inherently risky and is subject to delays, misinterpretation of geologic or engineering data, unexpected geologic conditions or finding reserves of disappointing quality or quantity, which may result in significant losses.\nOccidental\u2019s oil and gas business operates in highly competitive environments, which affect, among other things, its ability to source production and replace reserves.\nResults of operations, reserves replacement and the level of oil and gas production depend, in part, on Occidental\u2019s ability to profitably acquire additional reserves. Occidental has many competitors (including national oil companies), some of which: (i) are larger and better funded; (ii) may be willing to accept greater risks; (iii) have greater access to capital; (iv) have substantially larger staffs; or (v) have special competencies. Competition for access to reserves may make it more difficult to find attractive investment opportunities or require delay of reserve replacement efforts. Further, during periods of low product prices, any cash conservation efforts may delay production growth and reserve replacement efforts. Also, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and natural gas industry. Our failure to acquire properties, potentially grow production, replace reserves and attract and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations.\nIn addition, Occidental\u2019s acquisition activities carry risks that it may: (i) not fully realize anticipated benefits due to less-than-expected reserves or production or changed circumstances, such as declines in oil, NGL and natural gas prices; (ii) bear unexpected integration costs or experience other integration difficulties; (iii) experience share price declines based on the market\u2019s evaluation of the activity; or (iv) be subject to liabilities that are greater than anticipated.\nOccidental\u2019s oil and gas reserves are estimates based on professional judgments and may be subject to revision.\nReported oil and gas reserves are an estimate based on periodic review of reservoir characteristics and recoverability, including production decline rates, operating performance and economic feasibility at the prescribed weighted average commodity prices, future operating costs and capital expenditures, workover and remedial costs, assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies, the quantity, quality and interpretation of relevant data, taxes and availability of funds. The procedures and methods for estimating the reserves by our internal engineers were reviewed by independent petroleum consultants; however, there are inherent uncertainties in estimating reserves. Actual production, revenues, expenditures, oil, NGL and natural gas prices and taxes with respect to our reserves may vary from estimates and the variance may be material. Additional regulation around GHG emissions and future costs related to a lower carbon intensive economy could result in a shortened oil and gas reservoir reserve life as the underlying reserves become uneconomical. If Occidental were required to make significant negative reserve revisions, its results of operations and stock price could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the discounted cash flows included in this Form 10-K should not be construed as the fair value of the reserves attributable to our properties. The estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are based on an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the year in accordance with SEC regulations. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from SEC regulation-compliant prices and costs used for\nOXY 2021 FORM 10-K\nRISK FACTORS\npurposes of estimating future discounted net cash flows from proved reserves. Also, actual future net cash flows may differ from these discounted net cash flows due to the amount and timing of actual production, availability of financing for capital expenditures necessary to develop our undeveloped reserves, supply and demand for oil, NGL and natural gas, increases or decreases in consumption of oil, NGL and natural gas and changes in governmental regulations or taxation.\nOccidental\u2019s future results could be adversely affected if it is unable to execute new business strategies effectively.\nOccidental\u2019s results of operations depend on the extent to which it can execute new business strategies effectively relative to both the larger transition to sustainable energy and government regulation regarding the environment and climate change. Occidental\u2019s strategies, which include the goal of reaching net-zero emissions in its operations and energy use before 2040, are subject to business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond its control. Additionally, Occidental may be forced to develop or implement new technologies at substantial costs to achieve its strategies. Effective execution of these goals may require substantial new capital, which might not be available to Occidental in the amounts or at the times expected. In addition, raising such capital may increase our leverage or overall costs of doing business. These uncertainties and costs could cause Occidental to not be able to fully implement or realize the anticipated results and benefits of its business strategies.\nCertain of Occidental\u2019s emissions goals are dependent upon the successful implementation of new and existing technology on an industrial scale. These technologies are in various stages of development or implementation and may require more capital, or take longer to develop, than currently expected. Further, these carbon management technologies are in competition with technology being developed by other companies. The carbon management solutions are not well established and, while Occidental believes it has access to the technology and the expertise necessary to develop these on an industrial scale, Occidental may not ultimately succeed in achieving its GHG emissions reduction and net-zero goals.\nOccidental\u2019s strategy to include carbon management in its product line is also dependent upon demand for carbon sequestration and related carbon offsets and attributes. If this market does not develop, or if the regulatory environment does not support carbon management activities, Occidental may not be successful in entering this industry.\nOccidental\u2019s aspirations, goals and initiatives related to carbon management and overall sustainability expose it to numerous risks.\nWe continue to develop new technology and strategies to meet our emissions goals. Our efforts to research, establish, accomplish and accurately report on our emissions goals, targets and strategies expose Occidental to numerous operational, reputational, financial, legal and other risks. Our ability to reach our target emissions is subject to a multitude of factors and conditions, many of which are out of our control. Examples of such factors include evolving government regulation, the pace of changes in technology, the successful development and deployment of existing or new technologies and business solutions on a commercial scale, the availability, timing and cost of equipment, manufactured goods and services, and the availability of requisite financing and federal and state incentive programs.\nOccidental may face increased scrutiny from the investment community, other stakeholders and the media related to its emissions goals and strategies. If Occidental\u2019s emissions goals and strategies to achieve them do not meet evolving investor or other stakeholder expectations or standards, Occidental\u2019s reputation, ability to attract and retain employees and attractiveness as an investment, business partner or acquirer could be negatively impacted. Similarly, Occidental\u2019s failure or perceived failure to fulfill its emissions goals and targets, to comply with ethical, environmental, social, governance or other standards, regulations, or expectations, or to satisfy various reporting standards with respect to these matters effectively could have the same negative impacts and further expose Occidental to government enforcement actions and private litigation. Even if Occidental achieves its goals, targets and objectives, it may not realize all of the benefits that it expected at the time the goals were established.\nOccidental has previously recorded impairments of its proved and unproved oil and gas properties and will continue to assess further impairments in the future.\nWe have recorded impairments of our proved and unproved oil and gas properties resulting from prolonged declines in oil and gas prices and may record such impairments in the future. Past impairments included pre-tax impairment and related charges to both proved and unproved oil and gas properties and a lower of cost or net realizable value adjustment for crude inventory. If there is an adverse downturn of the macroeconomic conditions and if such downturn is expected to or does persist for a prolonged period of time, Occidental\u2019s oil and gas properties may be subject to further testing for impairment, which could result in additional non-cash asset impairments. Such impairments could be material to the financial statements.\nFuture costs associated with reducing emissions and carbon impacts, as well as impacts resulting from other risk factors described herein, could lead to impairments in the future, if such costs significantly increase our breakeven economics.\nOXY 2021 FORM 10-K\nRISK FACTORS\nOccidental uses CO2 for its EOR operations. Occidental\u2019s production from these operations may decline if Occidental is not able to obtain sufficient amounts of CO2.\nOccidental\u2019s CO2 EOR operations are critical to Occidental\u2019s long-term strategy. Oil production from Occidental\u2019s CO2 EOR projects depends largely on having access to sufficient amounts of naturally occurring or anthropogenic (human-made) CO2. Occidental\u2019s ability to produce oil from its CO2 EOR projects would be hindered if the supply of CO2 was limited due to, among other things, problems with current CO2 producing wells and facilities, including compression equipment, catastrophic pipeline failure or the ability to economically purchase naturally occurring or anthropogenic CO2. This could have a material adverse effect on Occidental\u2019s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Future oil production from its CO2 EOR operations is dependent on the timing, volumes and location of CO2 injections and, in particular, Occidental\u2019s ability to obtain sufficient volumes of CO2. Market conditions may cause the delay or cancellation of the development of naturally occurring CO2 sources or construction of plants that produce anthropogenic CO2 as a byproduct that can be purchased, thus limiting the amount of CO2 available for use in Occidental\u2019s CO2 EOR operations.\nOccidental is exposed to cyber-related risks.\nThe oil and gas industry is increasingly dependent on digital and industrial control technologies to conduct certain exploration, development and production activities. Occidental relies on digital and industrial control systems, related infrastructure, technologies and networks to run its business and to control and manage its oil and gas, chemicals, marketing and pipeline operations. Use of the internet, cloud services, mobile communication systems and other public networks exposes Occidental\u2019s business and that of other third parties with whom Occidental does business to cyber attacks. Cyber attacks on businesses have escalated in recent years.\nInformation and industrial control technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches of data security could disrupt our operations by causing delays, impeding processing of transactions and reporting financial results, leading to the unintentional disclosure of company, partner, customer or employee information or could damage our reputation. A cyber attack involving our information or industrial control systems and related infrastructure, or that of our business associates, could negatively impact our operations in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u25a0Unauthorized access to seismic data, reserves information, strategic information or other sensitive or proprietary information could have a negative impact on our ability to compete for oil and natural gas resources;\n\u25a0Data corruption, communication or systems interruption or other operational disruption during drilling activities could result in delays and failure to reach the intended target or cause a drilling incident;\n\u25a0Data corruption, communication or systems interruption or operational disruptions of production-related infrastructure could result in a loss of production or accidental discharge;\n\u25a0A cyber attack on our chemical operations could result in a disruption of the manufacturing and marketing of our products or a potential environmental hazard;\n\u25a0A cyber attack on a vendor or service provider could result in supply chain disruptions, which could delay or halt our construction and development projects;\n\u25a0A cyber attack on third-party gathering, pipeline, processing, terminal or other infrastructure systems could delay or prevent us from producing, transporting, processing and marketing our production;\n\u25a0A cyber attack involving commodities exchanges or financial institutions could slow or halt commodities trading, thus preventing us from marketing our production or engaging in hedging activities;\n\u25a0A cyber attack that halts activities at a power generation facility or refinery using natural gas as feedstock could have a significant impact on the natural gas market;\n\u25a0A cyber attack on a communications network or power grid could cause operational disruption;\n\u25a0A cyber attack on our automated and surveillance systems could cause a loss in production and potential environmental hazards;\n\u25a0A deliberate corruption of our financial or operating data could result in events of non-compliance which could then lead to regulatory fines or penalties; and\n\u25a0A cyber attack resulting in the loss or disclosure of, or damage to, our or any of our customer\u2019s or supplier\u2019s data or confidential information could harm our business by damaging our reputation, subjecting us to potential financial or legal liability and requiring us to incur significant costs, including costs to repair or restore our systems and data or to take other remedial steps.\nAlthough Occidental has implemented controls and multiple layers of security to mitigate the risks of a cyber attack that it believes are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such cyber security measures will be sufficient to prevent security breaches of its systems from occurring, and if a breach occurs, it may remain undetected for an extended period of time. Further, Occidental has no control over the comparable systems of the third parties with whom it does business. While Occidental has experienced cyber attacks in the past, Occidental has not suffered any material losses. However, if in the future Occidental\u2019s cyber security measures are compromised or prove insufficient, the potential consequences to Occidental\u2019s businesses and the communities in which it operates could be significant. As cyber attacks continue to evolve\nOXY 2021 FORM 10-K\nRISK FACTORS\nin magnitude and sophistication, Occidental may be required to expend additional resources in order to continue to enhance Occidental\u2019s cyber security measures and to investigate and remediate any digital and operational systems, related infrastructure, technologies and network security vulnerabilities, which would increase our costs. A system failure or data security breach, or a series of such failures or breaches, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOccidental\u2019s oil and gas reserve additions may not continue at the same rate and a failure to replace reserves may negatively affect Occidental\u2019s business.\nProducing oil and natural gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Unless Occidental conducts successful exploration or development activities, acquires properties containing proved reserves, or both, proved reserves will generally decline and negatively impact our business. The value of our securities and our ability to raise capital will be adversely impacted if we are not able to replace reserves that are depleted by production or replace our declining production with new production by successfully allocating annual capital to maintain our reserves and production base. Occidental expects infill development projects, extensions, discoveries and improved recovery to continue as main sources for reserve additions but factors such as geology, government regulations and permits, the effectiveness of development plans and the ability to make the necessary capital investments or acquire capital are partially or fully outside management\u2019s control and could cause results to differ materially from expectations.\nOccidental\u2019s operations and financial results could be significantly negatively impacted by its offshore operations.\nOccidental is vulnerable to risks associated with our offshore operations that could negatively impact our operations and financial results. Occidental conducts offshore operations primarily in the Gulf of Mexico and its operations and financial results are vulnerable to certain unique risks associated with operating offshore, including conditions relating to the following:\n\u25a0Hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions;\n\u25a0Geological complexities and water depths associated with such operations;\n\u25a0Limited number of partners available to participate in projects;\n\u25a0Oilfield service costs and availability;\n\u25a0Compliance with environmental, safety and other laws and regulations;\n\u25a0Terrorist attacks or piracy;\n\u25a0Remediation and other costs and regulatory changes resulting from oil spills, emissions or releases of hazardous materials;\n\u25a0Failure of equipment or facilities; and\n\u25a0Response capabilities for personnel, equipment or environmental incidents.\nIn addition, Occidental conducts some of its exploration in deep waters (greater than 1,000 feet) where operations, support services and decommissioning activities are more difficult and costly than in shallower waters. The deep waters in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as international deep-water locations, lack the physical and oilfield service infrastructure present in shallower waters. As a result, deep-water operations may require significant time between a discovery and the time that Occidental can market its production, thereby increasing the risk involved with these operations.\nOccidental\u2019s operations in the Gulf of Mexico were negatively impacted by Hurricane Ida in 2021, which reduced production by approximately 2.5 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMboe), associated with safely shutting in production, evacuating and then restarting the platforms.\nOccidental\u2019s indebtedness may make it more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in its business. Downgrades in Occidental\u2019s credit ratings or future increases in interest rates may negatively impact Occidental\u2019s cost of capital, and ability to access capital markets.\nOccidental\u2019s level of indebtedness could increase Occidental\u2019s vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions, economic downturns and adverse developments in its business and/or limit Occidental\u2019s flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in its business and the industries in which it operates. From time to time, Occidental has relied on access to capital markets for funding, including in connection with the Acquisition. There can be no assurance that additional debt or equity financing will be available to Occidental in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. Occidental\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing or refinancing will be subject to a number of factors, including general economic and market conditions, Occidental\u2019s performance, investor sentiment and its ability to meet existing debt compliance requirements. If Occidental is unable to generate sufficient funds from its operations to satisfy its capital requirements, including its existing debt obligations, or to raise additional capital on acceptable terms, Occidental\u2019s business could be\nOXY 2021 FORM 10-K\nRISK FACTORS\nadversely affected. As of the date of this filing, Occidental\u2019s long-term debt was rated BB+ by Fitch Ratings, Ba2 by Moody\u2019s Investors Service and BB+ by Standard and Poor\u2019s. Any downgrade in the credit ratings of Occidental could negatively impact its cost of, and ability to access, capital and to effectively execute aspects of its strategy and may require Occidental to provide cash collateral, letters of credit or other forms of security under certain contractual agreements, which would increase Occidental\u2019s operating costs and reduce liquidity.\nOne of Occidental\u2019s subsidiaries acts as the general partner of WES, a publicly traded master limited partnership, which may involve potential legal liability.\nOne of Occidental\u2019s subsidiaries acts as the general partner of WES, a publicly traded master limited partnership. Our general partner interest in WES may increase the possibility that we could be subject to claims of breach of duties owed to WES, including claims of conflict of interest. Any such claims could increase our costs and any liability resulting from such claims could have a material adverse effect on Occidental\u2019s financial condition, operating results or cash flows.\nAnadarko\u2019s Tronox settlement may not be deductible for income tax purposes; Occidental may be required to repay the tax refund Anadarko received in 2016 related to the deduction of the Tronox settlement payment, which may have a material adverse effect on Occidental\u2019s results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nIn April 2014, Anadarko and Kerr-McGee Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, Kerr-McGee) entered into a settlement agreement for $5.2 billion, resolving, among other things, all claims that were or could have been asserted in connection with the May 2009 lawsuit filed by Tronox against Anadarko and Kerr-McGee in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. After the settlement became effective in January 2015, Anadarko paid $5.2 billion and deducted this payment on its 2015 federal income tax return. Due to the deduction, Anadarko had a net operating loss carryback for 2015, which resulted in a tentative tax refund of $881 million in 2016.\nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has audited Anadarko\u2019s tax position regarding the deductibility of the payment and in September 2018 issued a statutory notice of deficiency rejecting Anadarko\u2019s refund claim. Anadarko disagreed and filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court to dispute the disallowance in November 2018. The case was in the IRS appeals process until the second quarter of 2020; however, it has since been returned to the U.S. Tax Court, where a trial date has been set for July 2022 and Occidental expects to continue pursuing resolution. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 740\u2019s guidance on the accounting for uncertain tax positions, as of December 31, 2021, Occidental has recorded no tax benefit on the tentative cash tax refund. If the payment is ultimately determined not to be deductible, Occidental would be required to repay the tentative refund received plus interest totaling approximately $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2021, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and consolidated balance sheets. Occidental\u2019s consolidated financial statements include an uncertain tax position for the approximate repayment of $1 billion ($1 billion federal and $27 million in state taxes) plus accrued interest of approximately $314 million. This amount is not covered by insurance.
