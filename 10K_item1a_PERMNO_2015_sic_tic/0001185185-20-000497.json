The risk factors discussed below should be considered in conjunction with the other information contained in this annual report on Form 10-K. If any of these risks actually materialize, our business, results of operations, financial condition or future prospects could be negatively impacted. These risks are not the only ones we face. There may be additional risks that are presently unknown to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial that could affect us.\nWe expect the impact of COVID-19 to adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is a serious threat to health and economic wellbeing affecting our customers, our associates and our suppliers. Federal, state and local authorities have recommended social distancing and have imposed or are considering quarantine and isolation measures on large portions of the population, including mandatory business closures for all non-essential businesses in certain jurisdictions. As home furnishings purchases are largely postponable and most of our customer\u2019s businesses are classified as non-essential, traffic to our customers\u2019 stores and demand for our products have decreased and our sales have deteriorated, therefore we expect our earnings and liquidity to be negatively impacted as a result. COVID-19 also impacted and continues to impact our Asian supply chain, particularly as a result of mandatory shutdowns in locations where our products are manufactured, we have experienced out-of-stocks and lost sales as a result. Due to decreased demand and stay-at-home orders issued by the state government, our domestic manufacturing and warehouse associates are working fewer hours and most of our administrative associates are tele-commuting. However, we may be forced to close locations for reasons such as the health of our associates, because of disruptions in the continued operation of our domestic or Asian supply chain or due to further federal, state or local orders impacting our operations.\nThe extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our business and financial results will also depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak within the markets in which we operate and the related impact on consumer confidence and spending, all of which are highly uncertain and ever-changing. The sweeping nature of the COVID-19 pandemic makes it extremely difficult to predict how our business and operations will be affected in the longer run. However, the likely overall economic impact of the pandemic is viewed as highly negative to the general economy. Any of the foregoing factors, or other cascading effects of the coronavirus pandemic, could materially increase our costs, negatively impact our sales and damage the company\u2019s results of operations and its liquidity, possibly to a significant degree. The duration of any such impacts cannot be predicted.\nWe rely on offshore sourcing from Vietnam and China for most of our sales. Consequently:\n\u25a0\nRecently enacted tariffs and potential future increases in tariffs on manufactured goods imported from China could adversely affect our business.\nEffective September 24, 2018, the current U.S. administration imposed a 10% tariff on certain goods imported into the United States from China, including all furniture and furniture components manufactured in China, which increased to 25% in May 2019. Inability to reduce product costs, pass through price increases or find other suitable manufacturing sources outside of China may have a material adverse impact on sales volume, earnings and liquidity. In addition, the tariffs, and our responses to the tariffs, may cause our products to become less competitive due to price increases or less profitable due to lower margins. Our inability to effectively manage the negative impacts of changing U.S. and foreign trade policies could adversely affect our business and financial results.\n\u25a0\nWe are subject to changes in U.S. and foreign government regulations and in the political, social and economic climates of the countries from which we source our products.\nChanges in political, economic and social conditions, as well as in the laws and regulations in the foreign countries from which we source our products could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity. These changes could make it more difficult to provide products and service to our customers or could increase the cost of those products. International trade regulations and policies of the United States and the countries from which we source finished products could adversely affect us. Imposition of trade sanctions relating to imports, taxes, import duties and other charges on imports affecting our products could increase our costs and decrease our earnings. For example, the U.S. Department of Commerce imposes tariffs on wooden bedroom furniture coming into the United States from China. In this case, none of the rates imposed have been of sufficient magnitude to alter our import strategy in any meaningful way; however, these and other tariffs are subject to review and could be increased or new tariffs implemented in the future.\n\u25a0\nA disruption in supply from Vietnam or China or from our most significant Vietnamese or Chinese suppliers could adversely affect our ability to timely fill customer orders for these products and decrease our sales, earnings and liquidity.\nIn fiscal 2020, imported products sourced from Vietnam and China accounted for nearly all of our import purchases and our top five suppliers in Vietnam and China account for approximately half of our fiscal 2020 import purchases. A disruption in our supply chain, or from Vietnam or China in general, could significantly impact our ability to fill customer orders for products manufactured in those countries. Our supply chain could be adversely impacted by the uncertainties of health concerns and governmental restrictions. In early 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak in China resulted in the temporary shutdown or reduced capacity of our vendors\u2019 factories and significantly slowed the post-Chinese New Year production recovery. Consequently, we experienced some out-of-stocks, but we in some cases were able to provide substitutions out of inventory on hand, in-transit and from our domestic warehouses, but not enough to entirely mitigate the lost sales. Many of our vendors\u2019 factories are back online and others have closed temporarily because of low demand due to the effects of COVID-19 in the U.S. and elsewhere. Consequently, we expect shortages of certain products. If such disruptions were to occur again, we believe that we would have sufficient inventory on hand and in transit to our U.S. warehouses in Virginia, North Carolina and California to adequately meet demand for several months or slightly longer with an additional month\u2019s worth of demand available for immediate shipment from our warehouses in Asia. We believe we could, most likely at higher cost, source most of the products currently sourced in Vietnam or China from factories in other countries and could produce certain upholstered products domestically at our own factories. However, supply disruptions and delays on selected items could occur for six months or longer before the impact of remedial measures would be reflected in our results. Additionally, we have limited insight into how our supply chain could be further impacted by COVID-19 and there are many unknowns including how long we will be impacted, the severity of the impacts and the probability of a recurrence of COVID-19 or similar regional or global pandemics. If we were to be unsuccessful in obtaining those products from other sources or at comparable cost, a disruption in our supply chain from our largest import furniture suppliers, or from Vietnam or China in general, could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity.\n\u25a0\nIncreased freight costs on imported products could decrease earnings and liquidity.\nOcean freight costs on imported products currently represent a significant portion of the cost of our imported products. Ocean freight rates on our imported products are affected by a myriad of factors including the global economy, petroleum prices and ocean freight carrier capacity. Increased ocean freight rates in the future would likely adversely affect earnings, financial condition and liquidity.\n\u25a0\nOur dependence on suppliers could, over time, adversely affect our ability to service customers.\nWe rely heavily on suppliers we do not own or control, including a large number of non-US suppliers. All of our suppliers may not provide goods that meet our quality, design or other specifications in a timely manner and at a competitive price. If our suppliers do not meet our specifications, we may need to find alternative suppliers, potentially at a higher cost, or may be forced to discontinue products. Also, delivery of goods from non-U.S. suppliers may be delayed for reasons not typically encountered for domestically manufactured furniture, such as shipment delays caused by customs issues, labor issues, port-related issues such as weather, congestion or port equipment, decreased availability of shipping containers and/or the inability to secure space aboard shipping vessels to transport our products. Our failure to timely fill customer orders due to an extended business interruption for a major supplier, or due to transportation issues, could negatively impact existing customer relationships and adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity.\n\u25a0\nOur inability to accurately forecast demand for our imported products could cause us to purchase too much, too little or the wrong mix of inventory.\nManufacturing and delivery lead times for our imported products necessitate that we make forecasts and assumptions regarding current and future demand for these products. If our forecasts and assumptions are inaccurate, we may purchase excess or insufficient amounts of inventory. If we purchase too much or the wrong mix of inventory, we may be forced to sell it at lower margins, which could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity. If we purchase too little or the wrong mix of inventory, we may not be able to fill customer orders and may lose market share and weaken or damage customer relationships, which also could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity.\n\u25a0\nChanges in the value of the U.S. Dollar compared to the currencies for the countries from which we obtain our imported products could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity.\nFor imported products, we generally negotiate firm pricing with our foreign suppliers in U.S. Dollars, typically for periods of at least one year. We accept the exposure to exchange rate movements beyond these negotiated periods. We do not use derivative financial instruments to manage this risk but could choose to do so in the future. Since we transact our imported product purchases in U.S. Dollars, a relative decline in the value of the U.S. Dollar could increase the price we must pay for imported products beyond the negotiated periods. These price changes could decrease our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity during affected periods.\n\u25a0\nSupplier transitions, including cost or quality issues, could result in longer lead times and shipping delays.\nIn the past, inflation concerns, and to a lesser extent quality and supplier viability concerns, affecting some of our imported product suppliers located in China prompted us to source more of our products from lower cost suppliers located in other countries, such as Vietnam. As discussed above, during fiscal 2020 we transitioned a significant portion of our imported product purchases from China to Vietnam due to the imposition of tariffs on most furniture and component parts imported from China. As conditions dictate, we could be forced to make similar transitions in the future. When undertaken, transitions of this type involve significant planning and coordination by and between us and our new suppliers in these countries. Despite our best efforts and those of our new sourcing partners, these transition efforts are likely to result in longer lead times and shipping delays over the short term. Risks associated with product defects, including higher than expected costs associated with product quality and safety, and regulatory compliance costs related to the sale of consumer products and costs related to defective or non-compliant products, including product liability claims and costs to recall defective products. One or a combination of these issues could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity.\nA disruption affecting our domestic facilities could disrupt our business.\nThe warehouses in which we store our inventory in Virginia, North Carolina and California are critical to our success. Our corporate and divisional headquarters, which house our administration, sourcing, sales, finance, merchandising, customer service and logistics functions for our imported and domestic products are located in Virginia and North Carolina. Our domestic upholstery manufacturing facilities are located in Virginia and North Carolina. Furniture manufacturing creates large amounts of highly flammable wood dust and utilizes other highly flammable materials such as varnishes and solvents in its manufacturing processes and is therefore subject to the risk of losses arising from explosions and fires. Additionally, our domestic operations have been negatively affected recently by COVID-19. We enacted business continuity plans and most administrative employees are telecommuting given recommendations for social distancing and stay-at-home orders from state and local governments. We instituted increased cleaning regimens and have instituted social distancing for manufacturing and warehousing associates. Additionally, due to the adverse effect on our sales, some domestic associates have been furloughed or laid off. Any disruption affecting our domestic facilities, for even a relatively short period of time, could adversely affect our ability to ship our furniture products and disrupt our business, which could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity.\nFluctuations in the price, availability or quality of raw materials for our domestically manufactured upholstered furniture could cause manufacturing delays, adversely affect our ability to provide goods to our customers or increase our costs.\nWe use various types of wood, leather, fabric, foam and other filling material, high carbon spring steel, bar and wire stock and other raw materials in manufacturing upholstered furniture. We depend on outside suppliers for raw materials and must obtain sufficient quantities of quality raw materials from these suppliers at acceptable prices and in a timely manner. We do not have long-term supply contracts with our suppliers. Unfavorable fluctuations in the price, quality or availability of required raw materials could negatively affect our ability to meet the demands of our customers. We may not always be able to pass price increases in raw materials through to our customers due to competition and other market pressures. The inability to meet customers\u2019 demands or recover higher costs could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity.\nIf demand for our domestically manufactured upholstered furniture declines, we may respond by realigning manufacturing.\nOur domestic manufacturing operations make only upholstered furniture. A decline in demand for our domestically produced upholstered furniture could result in the realignment of our domestic manufacturing operations and capabilities and the implementation of cost-saving measures. These programs could include the consolidation and integration of facilities, functions, systems and procedures. We may decide to source certain products from other suppliers instead of continuing to manufacture them. These realignments and cost-saving measures typically involve initial upfront costs and could result in decreases in our near-term earnings before the expected cost savings are realized, if they are realized at all. We may not always accomplish these actions as quickly as anticipated and may not achieve the expected cost savings, which could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity.\nThe interruption, inadequacy or security failure of our information systems or information technology infrastructure or the internet or inadequate levels of cyber-insurance could adversely impact our business, sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity.\nOur information systems (software) and information technology (hardware) infrastructure platforms and those of third parties who provide these services to us, including internet service providers and third-parties who store data for us on their servers (\u201cthe cloud\u201d), facilitate and support every facet of our business, including the sourcing of raw materials and finished goods, planning, manufacturing, warehousing, customer service, shipping, accounting, payroll and human resources. Our systems, and those of third parties who provide services to us, are vulnerable to disruption or damage caused by a variety of factors including, but not limited to: power disruptions or outages; natural disasters or other so-called \u201cActs of God\u201d; computer system or network failures; viruses or malware; physical or electronic break-ins; the theft of computers, tablets and smart phones utilized by our employees or contractors; unauthorized access, phishing and cyber-attacks. The risk of cyberattacks also includes attempted breaches of contractors, business partners, vendors and other third parties. We have a cybersecurity program designed to protect and preserve the integrity of our information systems. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience actual or attempted cyber-attacks of our information systems or networks; however, none of these actual or attempted cyber-attacks had a material impact on our operations or financial condition. Additionally, while we carry cyber insurance, including insurance for social engineering fraud, the amounts of insurance we carry may be inadequate due either to inadequate limits available from the insurance markets or inadequate coverage purchased. Because cyber threat scenarios are inherently difficult to predict and can take many forms, cyber insurance may not cover certain risks. Further, legislative or regulatory action in these areas is evolving, and we may be unable to adapt our information systems or to manage the information systems of third parties to accommodate these changes. If these information systems or technologies are interrupted or fail, or we are unable to adapt our systems or those of third parties as a result of legislative or regulatory actions, our operations and reputation may be adversely affected, we may be subject to legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations and actions, which could diminish investor and customer confidence which could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity.\nA material part of our sales and accounts receivable are concentrated in a few customers. The loss of several large customers through business consolidations, failures or other reasons, including the adverse economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or similar events, could adversely affect our business.\nOne customer accounted for approximately 11% of our consolidated sales in fiscal 2020, our top five customers accounted for about 30% of our fiscal 2020 consolidated sales. 35% of our consolidated accounts receivable is concentrated in our top five customers. Should any one of these receivables become uncollectible, it would have an immediate and material adverse impact on our financial condition and liquidity. The loss of any one or more of these customers could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity. The loss of several of our major customers through business consolidations, failures or otherwise, could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity and the resulting loss in sales may be difficult or impossible to replace. Should the negative economic effects of COVID-19 persist or another similar event or events occur, the negative developments described in this paragraph would be more likely to occur. Amounts owed to us by a customer whose business fails, or is failing, may become uncollectible, and we could lose future sales, any of which could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe may not be able to collect amounts owed to us.\nWe grant payment terms to most customers ranging from 30 to 60 days and do not generally require collateral. However, in some instances we provide longer payment terms. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, during the fiscal 2021 first quarter some customers have requested extended payment terms or informed us they will not pay amounts within agreed upon terms. We also purchase credit insurance on certain customers\u2019 receivables and factor certain other customer accounts. Some of our customers have experienced, and may in the future experience, credit-related issues. Were the negative economic effects of COVID-19 to persist or a similar pandemic or another major, unexpected event with negative economic effects occur, we may not be able to collect amounts owed to us or such payment may only occur after significant delay. While we perform credit evaluations of our customers, those evaluations may not prevent uncollectible trade accounts receivable. Credit evaluations involve significant management diligence and judgment, especially in the current environment. We may be unable to obtain sufficient credit insurance on certain customers\u2019 receivable balances. Should more customers than we anticipate experience liquidity issues, if payment is not received on a timely basis, or if a customer declares bankruptcy or closes stores, we may have difficulty collecting amounts owed to us by these customers, which could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity.\nUnauthorized disclosure of confidential information provided to us by our customers, employees, or third parties could harm our business.\nWe rely on the internet and other electronic methods to transmit confidential information and we store confidential information on our networks. If there was a disclosure of confidential information by our employees or contractors, including accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of information, or if a third party were to gain access to the confidential information we possess, our reputation could be harmed, and we could be subject to civil or criminal liability and regulatory actions. A claim that is brought against us, successful or unsuccessful, that is uninsured or under-insured could harm our business, result in substantial costs, divert management attention and adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity.\nOur sales and operating results could be adversely affected by product safety concerns.\nIf our product offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or consumers' expectations regarding safety, we could experience decreased sales, increased costs and/or be exposed to legal and reputational risk. Events that give rise to actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to regulatory enforcement action and/or private litigation. While we carry general and umbrella liability insurance for such events, settlements or jury awards could exceed our policy limits. Reputational damage caused by real or perceived product safety concerns or failure to prevail in private litigation against us could adversely affect our business, sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe incurred significant debt to provide permanent financing for recent acquisitions.\nWe currently owe $30.1 million on term loans for recent acquisitions. Principal and interest payments on the borrowed funds were $6.4 million in fiscal 2020. We are subject to interest rate volatility due to the variable interest rates on these term loans. Among other risks, our debt:\n\u25a0\nmay limit our flexibility to pursue other strategic opportunities or react to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and, consequently, place us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors with less debt;\n\u25a0\nwill require a portion of our cash flows from operations to be used for debt service payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, dividend payments and other general corporate purposes;\n\u25a0\nmay result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in market interest rates for both long-term debt as well as any borrowings under our line of credit at variable rates; and\n\u25a0\nmay require that additional terms, conditions or covenants be placed on us.\nAdditionally, all balances under these term loans are due and payable on February 1, 2021, the first day of fiscal 2022. We intend to refinance these loans during fiscal 2021. If we are unsuccessful in refinancing these loans, it would have a material adverse impact on our liquidity. If the negative economic effects of COVID-19 persist, it would likely have a material adverse effect on our sales, earnings and liquidity. Consequently, our credit rating may decrease and refinancing our debt may be more difficult and any new loans more costly.\nWe may engage in acquisitions and investments in companies, form strategic alliances and pursue new business lines. These activities could disrupt our business, dilute our earnings per share, decrease the value of our common stock and decrease our earnings and liquidity.\nWe may acquire or invest in businesses such as those that offer complementary products and that we believe offer competitive advantages. However, we may fail to identify significant liabilities or risks that could negatively affect us or result in our paying more for the acquired company or assets than they are worth. We may also have difficulty assimilating and integrating the operations and personnel of an acquired business into our current operations. Acquisitions may disrupt or distract management from our ongoing business. We may pay for future acquisitions using cash, stock, the assumption of debt, or a combination of these. Future acquisitions could result in dilution to existing shareholders and to earnings per share and decrease the value of our common stock. We may pursue new business lines in which we have limited or no prior experience or expertise. These pursuits may require substantial investment of capital and personnel. New business initiatives may fail outright or fail to produce an adequate return, which could adversely affect our earnings, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe may experience impairment of our long-lived assets, which would decrease our earnings and net worth.\nAt February 2, 2020, we had $103.3 million in net long-lived assets, consisting primarily of property, plant and equipment, trademarks, trade names and goodwill. Our goodwill, some trademarks and tradenames have indefinite useful lives and, consequently, are not subject to amortization for financial reporting purposes, but are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Our definite-lived assets consist of property, plant and equipment and certain intangible assets related to our recent acquisitions and are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. The outcome of impairment testing could result in the write-down of all or a portion of the value of these assets. A write-down of our assets would, in turn, reduce our earnings and net worth. See Notes 9 and 10 for additional information.\nWe may not be able to maintain or raise prices in response to inflation and increasing costs.\nCompetitive and market forces could prohibit future successful price increases for our products in order to offset increased costs of finished goods, raw materials, freight and other product-related costs, which could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity.\nEconomic downturns could result in decreased sales, earnings and liquidity.\nThe furniture industry is particularly sensitive to cyclical variations in the general economy and to uncertainty regarding future economic prospects, including the current and evolving negative economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Home furnishings are generally considered a postponable purchase by most consumers. Economic downturns could affect consumer spending habits by decreasing the overall demand for home furnishings. Changes in interest rates, consumer confidence, new housing starts, existing home sales, the availability of consumer credit and broader national or geopolitical factors have particularly significant effects on our business. We have seen negative effects on all of these measures due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A recovery in our sales could lag significantly behind a general recovery in the economy after an economic downturn, due to, among other things, the postponable nature and relatively significant cost of home furnishings purchases. These events could also impact retailers, our primary customers, possibly adversely affecting our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe may lose market share due to furniture retailers by-passing us and sourcing directly from non-U.S. furniture sources.\nSome large furniture retailers are sourcing directly from non-U.S. furniture factories. Over time, this practice may expand to smaller retailers. As a result, we are continually subject to the risk of losing market share, which could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity.\nFailure to anticipate or timely respond to changes in fashion and consumer tastes could adversely impact our business.\nFurniture is a styled product and is subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer tastes, as well as to increasingly shorter product life cycles. If we fail to anticipate or promptly respond to these changes we may lose market share or be faced with the decision of whether to sell excess inventory at reduced prices. This could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe may incur higher employee costs in the future.\nWe maintain self-insured healthcare and workers compensation plans for our employees. We have insurance coverage in place for aggregate claims above specified amounts in any year for both plans. Our healthcare costs in recent years have generally increased at the same rate or greater than the national average, and healthcare costs have increased more rapidly than general inflation in the U.S. economy. Continued inflation in healthcare costs, as well as additional costs we may incur as a result of current or future federal or state healthcare legislation and regulations, could significantly increase our employee healthcare costs in the future. Our workers compensation claims costs have had only a modest impact on our overall results of operations for quite some time; however, these costs may increase in the future without warning. Continued increases in our healthcare costs and increased workers compensation claims costs could adversely affect our earnings, financial condition and liquidity.\nOur results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of our results of operations for a full year.\nHome furnishings sales fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to factors such as changes in economic and competitive conditions, seasonality, weather conditions and changes in consumer order patterns. From time to time, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, volatility with respect to demand for our home furnishing products. Accordingly, our results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for a full year.\nFuture costs of complying with various laws and regulations may adversely impact future operating results.\nOur business is subject to various domestic and international laws and regulations that could have a significant impact on our operations and the cost to comply with such laws and regulations could adversely impact our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, failure to comply with such laws and regulations, even inadvertently, could produce negative consequences which could adversely impact our operations and reputation.", "PERMNO": 89416, "SIC": 2510, "TIC": "HOFT"}
