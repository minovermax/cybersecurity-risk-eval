RISK FACTORS\nOur business is subject to a number of material risks, including the following factors related directly and indirectly to our business activities in Poland and the United States.\nRisks Relating to our Business\nOur Senior Secured Credit Facility\nThe amount we can borrow under our Senior Secured Credit Facility is affected by currency exchange-rate fluctuations and gas prices, which affect our dollar-denominated cash flows and reserve values in Poland.\nThe amount that we can borrow under our up to $100 Million Senior Reserve Base Lending Facility Agreement (\u201cSenior Secured Credit Facility\u201d) is based on our lenders\u2019 evaluation of our reserves, and the expected future cash flow from those reserves, denominated in U.S. dollars. At December 31, 2013, a dollar was convertible into 3.01 Polish zlotys, while at December 31, 2014, the dollar was convertible into 3.51 zlotys, which is a 17% improvement in the value of the dollar relative to the zloty. As a result, the dollar value of the gas we sold declined by the same percentage. The increase in the value of the dollar relative to the zloty is continuing into 2015 and may continue in the future. These changes are outside our influence or control. An increase in the value of the dollar as compared to the zloty may have a proportionately larger impact on our borrowing base because of the resulting reduction in the value of our reserves and estimated future cash flows from production.\nWe may be unable to meet the reserve and future cash flow criteria to support the borrowing base of our current and/or a revised and amended credit facility.\nUnder the terms of our Senior Secured Credit Facility, and any amendment thereto, we are required to maintain minimum amounts of dollar-denominated reserves and estimated future net cash flows in order to maintain a specified borrowing base, which is redetermined every six months. If we fail to maintain such minimums, we will be required to reduce the borrowing base and pay down the principal balance if our outstanding borrowing exceeds the redetermined borrowing base, so that our reserves and cash flows provide adequate security to the lenders. We will need to increase reserves and estimated future cash flows in order to increase the amount we are able to draw down under our Senior Secured Credit Facility. We cannot assure that we will be able to maintain existing or increase borrowings from our lenders.\nWe may not be able to complete an amendment to our Senior Secured Credit Facility.\nWe are discussing with our lenders an amendment and restatement of our Senior Secured Credit Facility, which we hope to complete during the second quarter of 2015. Our efforts to complete this new arrangement may be adversely affected by further increases in the value of the dollar relative to the zloty, decreases in Polish gas prices, and further economic and political instability in the region. If we are unable to finalize our preliminary understanding or reach another extension agreement, we would likely be required to make principal payments in 2015 resulting from future borrowing base redeterminations, which would be sooner than the scheduled commitment reductions outlined in our Senior Secured Credit Facility.\nIf our borrowing base drops below our loan balance at any time, we would be required to reduce the principal, which may exceed our liquid resources.\nIn the event of our default under the Senior Secured Credit Facility, the lenders would be entitled to exercise their full remedies, including taking possession of our Poland producing properties encumbered as collateral for the loan and seek collection from us.\nOur 2015 Capital Budget\nWe have curtailed our capital budget for 2015, as compared to previous years, in recognition of the potential negative impact on our dollar-denominated Senior Secured Credit Facility borrowing base resulting from negative reserve revisions, exchange-rate fluctuations, and gas-price declines.\nOur 2015 budget is expected to be much lower than the actual capital expenditures of approximately $50 million in 2014 and $36 million in 2013. The reduction in our capital budget is due to the potential shortages of available funds resulting from negative reserve revisions, exchange-rate changes and the decline in gas prices in Poland, which may reduce our ability to borrow under our Senior Secured Credit Facility based on dollar-denominated proved reserves and estimated future net revenue from production. We may not be able to resume capital expenditures for exploration and development at our prior levels until the zloty exchange rate and gas prices improve sufficiently to warrant further borrowings, unless we obtain the benefit of capital provided by others through a farm out of an interest in the Edge, or until we obtain external significant capital from other sources. We cannot assure that we will able to obtain capital needed for our capital expenditures.\nWe may not be successful in farming out our Edge project in order to obtain third-party financial participation in further exploration, production facility construction, and other activities in that concession.\nIn order to diversify our exploration and financial risk and supplement our capital resources, we are seeking to farm out some of our 100% interest in the Edge concession under a typical industry arrangement in which another firm would provide agreed funding in order to earn an interest in the project. We cannot assure that we will be able to complete such an arrangement. In the absence of a farmout or other funding from external sources, or the successful amendment of our Senior Secured Credit Facility, our exploration of the Edge will be curtailed, and we will have to delay construction of the Tuchola pipeline and related production facilities in the Edge. Currently we have allocated funds only for seismic work and for designing and permitting the Tuchola pipeline and production facility in 2015.\nWe face increased exploration and financial risk in the Edge concession.\nAs we allocate more capital to the Edge, where we have drilled a total of three wells, two of which are commercial, we are entering a much less-explored area in which we have substantially less historical geological and geophysical data than the Fences. Further, since we are a 100% owner and operator in the Edge as compared to our 49% position in the Fences, we will bear all of the financial burden and risk of Edge exploration. Development and resulting financial risks are also increased in the Edge because it does not have a network of gas pipelines like the Fences. Therefore, we will have to incur substantial capital costs, and may incur delays, to build production facilities and pipelines in order to sell the gas we discover. For example, in the case of our Tuchola discoveries, with proved reserves as of December 31, 2014, of approximately 5.7 Bcf, we estimate that we may need to spend $25 million additionally to deliver the gas for sale, depending on the capacity, route, desired destination, and other specifications of the facilities. We cannot assure that these costs can be recovered from production.\nOur current planned level of reduced capital expenditures for 2015 may impact our relationship with PGNiG, our partner in Poland that controls our exploration and development activities in Poland in the Fences.\nAs in previous years, PGNiG will propose exploration and development activities for 2015 and beyond based on its expectation of our participation in these activities by bearing our share of project costs and providing technical and management resources. Our limited exploration budget for 2015 may require PGNiG to alter its plans, may jeopardize our working relationship with PGNiG, and may impair our ability to work together in further exploring and developing the Fences. Under our agreements with PGNiG, it has the right to undertake proposed joint activities for its own, sole account and pay all related costs. If we elect not to participate, we would forfeit our interest in such specific activities. Accordingly, we may lose the opportunity to participate fully in significant new discoveries in the Fences. Any failure to provide funding for operations that PGNiG proposes in the Fences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIn the Fences, we rely on the funding, operating initiative, and expertise provided by our partner, PGNiG, the operator of the Fences area.\nPGNiG, our partner in our Fences area, holds the majority interest and is operator of this area where our principal production and reserves are located. As a paying partner, we rely to a significant extent on the financial capabilities of PGNiG, which bears a share of the costs of many Fences projects as a joint owner. PGNiG\u2019s failure to perform its obligations under contracts with us would most likely have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In particular, we have prepared our exploration budget through 2015 and beyond based on the participation of, and funding to be provided by, PGNiG. Although we have rights to participate in exploration and development activities on some PGNiG-controlled acreage, we have limited rights to initiate these activities, which might slow the pace at which we would like to advance our exploration and development efforts. Similarly, as operator, PGNiG controls the level of production as well as other day-to-day operating details. Our ability to conduct certain activities may be affected by whether PGNiG classifies such activities as exploratory or development because of different internal budgetary considerations. Our program in Poland involving PGNiG-controlled acreage would be adversely affected if PGNiG should elect not to pursue activities on this acreage, if our relationship with PGNiG should deteriorate or terminate, or if PGNiG or the governmental agencies should fail to fulfill the requirements of, or elect to terminate, our agreements, licenses, or grants.\nExploration and Development\nWe cannot assure that the exploration models we are using in Poland will lead to finding gas or oil in Poland.\nWe cannot assure that the exploration models we or PGNiG develop will provide a useful or effective guide for our exploration or development activities, including selecting exploration prospects and drilling targets, particularly in the Edge, where we have substantially less geological and geophysical data than was the case in the Fences. In the Edge, where PGNiG has no interest, we do not have access to its exploration knowledge and experience. We continually review and revise or replace these exploration models as a guide to further exploration based on new data, including drilling results and interpretations. These exploration models are typically based on incomplete or unconfirmed data and theories that have not been fully tested. The seismic data, other technologies, and the study of producing fields in the area do not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling that gas or oil will be present in commercial quantities, even for development wells. The fact that some prospects may appear to have similar geological or geophysical subsurface features or may be located near previous wells cannot assure that such prospects are actually similar or that drilling results will be comparable. Every prospect is unique and must be evaluated individually. We cannot assure that the analogies that we draw from available data from other wells, fully explored prospects, or producing fields will be applicable to our drilling prospects or will enable us to forecast accurately drilling results.\nOur long-term success depends largely on our discovery and production of economic quantities of gas or oil in Poland.\nWe anticipate that our production will increase in 2015 from 2014 levels as previously drilled wells are placed into production, and that we will generate revenues in excess of direct lease operating costs as well as anticipated general and administrative costs. However, these revenues will not be sufficient to cover exploration and development costs at previous levels. We have reduced our planned 2015 exploration and development expenditures as compared to recent years in Poland because of potential shortages of available capital. Accordingly, we will continue to rely on existing working capital; borrowings under our current Senior Secured Credit Facility secured by future production from our reserves, to the extent that borrowings are available under bank borrowing base calculations; additional funds obtained from the sale of equity securities; other external sources; and industry partners to cover these costs. If we are unable to obtain the funds that we seek from these sources for our exploration and development plans, we may be required to further reduce our capital expenditures. Any reduction in exploration expenditures will have a long-term negative impact on future reserves and revenues.\nOur statements respecting the quantities of potential gas or oil accumulation that we estimate for management purposes should not be converted into reserves.\nFor purposes of management decisions and risk analysis, we use a variety of geological, engineering, and geophysical techniques to estimate probable or possible reserves and gross, unrisked resource potential. These various methods are important in making many kinds of management decisions during the exploration, development, and production process, but the quantities and values estimated through these methods are not comparable. We cannot assure that any gas or oil quantities or values that we estimate through alternative methods will ever be converted through additional exploration and production into reserves.\nOur estimates of proved oil and gas reserves and future net revenues are subject to various risks and uncertainties.\nOur estimates of oil and gas reserves and estimated future revenues, calculated by independent, third-party engineering firms, are based on various assumptions and estimates and are very complex and interpretative, as there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of proved reserves, projecting future sales of production, and the timing and amount of development expenditures. Many of these factors are beyond our control. Our proved reserve estimates are subject to continuing revisions as additional information becomes available or assumptions change. Although they rely in part on objective information, engineering evaluations of oil and gas reservoirs are essentially subjective processes of estimating the size, characteristics, and recoverability of underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured exactly. The actual production and future net revenues that we obtain from our oil and gas properties may vary substantially from those estimated, due to the factors and assumptions that have been used in completing these estimates, including:\n\u25cf\nour data regarding the geological, geophysical, and engineering characteristics of the underground reservoir;\n\u25cf\nknown production from other properties that we believe are analogs to our own wells;\n\u25cf\nthe assumed effects of regulatory requirements and government royalties and other payments;\n\u25cf\nthe costs of the construction of production facilities and pipeline connections and the timing of completing those facilities;\n\u25cf\nproduction and other operating policies and practices of PGNiG, the operator of most of our productive wells;\n\u25cf\nthe effect of certain terms that could be changed in the future, including gas and oil exploitation fees, royalty rates, pricing discounts or adjustments, and similar items;\n\u25cf\nmarket prices and demand for the oil and gas we produce;\n\u25cf\nexchange rates for the conversion of zlotys to dollars; and\n\u25cf\noil and gas quality and impurities that reduce the sales prices we actually receive below the posted or contract price.\nIn accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s rules for estimating oil and gas reserves, we use deterministic methods to determine proved reserves, based on 12-month average prices and currency exchange rates. Accordingly, reserve values may vary significantly on exchange-rate and price fluctuations unrelated to actual oil or gas quantities. The estimates of economically recoverable quantities of oil and gas attributable to any particular property, the classifications of those reserves based on risk or probability of recovery, and estimates of the future net cash flows expected from such properties prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers but at different times or with different assumptions may vary substantially. Therefore, reserve estimates may be subject to upward or downward adjustments, and actual production, revenue, and related expenditures are likely to vary, in some cases materially, from estimates.\nWe cannot accurately predict the size of exploration targets or foresee related risks.\nNotwithstanding the accumulation and study of 2-D and 3-D seismic data, drilling logs, drill-stem tests, production information from established fields, and other engineering, geological, and geophysical data, we cannot predict accurately the gas or oil potential of individual prospects and drilling targets or the related risks. We sometimes estimate the gross potential or possible reserves of gas or oil in a particular area as part of our evaluation of the exploration potential and related risks. Our estimates are only rough, preliminary geological forecasts of the volume and characteristics of possible reservoirs and the calculated potential gas or oil that could be contained if present and are unqualified by any risk evaluation. These forecasts are not an assurance that our exploration will be successful or that we will be able to establish reserves equal to such forecasts. In some cases, our estimates of possible reserves or oil and gas potential may be based on a review of data from other exploration or producing fields in the area that ultimately may be found not to be analogous to our exploration prospects. We may require several test wells and long-term analysis of test data and history of production to determine the gas or oil potential of individual prospects.\nWe may continue to have exploration failures in Poland.\nFrom 1995 through early 2015, we have participated in drilling or recompleting 49 exploratory wells in Poland, including 16 commercial discoveries, and 33 noncommercial wells. We expect that we will continue to drill noncommercial wells in the future. Of our 16 commercial successes in Poland, as of the date of this report we were producing gas at eight wells, all of which are located in our Fences concession. Production from three other commercial discoveries is scheduled to begin in 2016 and 2017 once requisite permits are obtained and production facilities are constructed. During 2014, we sold our three producing wells that were located in our Block 287 concession. Three early wells have been fully exploited and no longer produce.\nWe may not achieve the results anticipated in placing our current or future discoveries into production.\nWe currently estimate that it may take approximately two years or more to place a completed gas well on line so that we can commence production and sell gas from the well. We may encounter delays in commencing the production and sale of gas in Poland from our recent gas discoveries and other possible future discoveries. We may face delays in obtaining rights-of-way to connect to the PGNiG pipeline system, construction permits, and materials and contractors; signing gas or oil purchase/sales contracts; negotiating price and payment details; receiving commitments for required capital expenditures by PGNiG; and managing other factors. These delays could correspondingly postpone the commencement of cash flow and may require us to increase our reliance on borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facility pending commencement of production. Further, we may design and construct surface and pipeline facilities to accommodate anticipated production from future wells, but we cannot assure that any future wells will establish additional reserves or production that will provide an economic return for expenditures for those facilities. We may have to change our anticipated expenditures if costs of placing a particular discovery into production are higher, if the actual production is smaller than projected, or if the commencement of production takes longer than expected. Further, producing wells for which PGNiG acts as the operator generally are produced at levels that are established by and acceptable to it, which may be lower as compared to the productive capacity of similar wells in the United States.\nWe may not fulfill our work commitments on the concessions we hold in Poland.\nWe are subject to certain exploration concession work commitments that must be satisfied in order to maintain our interest in those concessions. Our exploration budget and related activities may not be focused specifically or primarily on meeting these work commitments. We may not be able to retain any concession rights on areas for which we do not timely complete required work commitments. We cannot assure that we will be granted any requested changes to usufruct and concession agreements that either modify the obligations to reduce our commitments or extend the terms of those agreements. We may lose our rights to exploration acreage if we cannot obtain required changes or extensions.\nThe loss of key personnel could have an adverse impact on our operations.\nWe rely on our officers, key employees, and consultants and their expertise, particularly David N. Pierce, President and Chief Executive Officer; Thomas B. Lovejoy, Executive Vice President; Andrew W. Pierce, Vice President-Operations; Jerzy B. Maciolek, Vice President-Exploration; Zbigniew Tatys, Poland Country Manager, and Richard Hardman, Technical Advisor to our board. The loss of the services of any of these individuals may disrupt our activities as we seek a replacement. Although we have entered into employment agreements with our key executives, we may not be able to retain such key executives. We do not maintain key-man insurance on any of our employees.\nOur industry is subject to numerous operating risks. Insurance may not be adequate to protect us against all these risks.\nOur oil and gas drilling and production operations are subject to hazards incidental to the industry. These hazards include blowouts, cratering, explosions, uncontrollable flows of oil, gas or well fluids, fires, pollution, releases of toxic gas, and other environmental hazards and risks. These hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage, and suspension of operations. To lessen the effects of these hazards, we maintain insurance of various types to cover our domestic and international operations. We cannot assure that the insurance policies carried by us or by PGNiG, as operator of the Fences area, can continue to be obtained on reasonable terms. While we do carry limited third-party liability and all-risk insurance in Poland, we do not plan to purchase well control insurance on wells we drill in the Fences project areas. We may purchase such insurance on Company-operated wells drilled in the Edge or other areas in Poland. The current level of insurance does not cover all of the risks involved in oil and gas exploration, drilling, and production. Where additional insurance coverage does exist, the amount of coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full amount of the liabilities. We may not be insured against all losses or liabilities that may arise from all hazards because such insurance is unavailable at economic rates, there are limitations on existing insurance coverage, or as a result of other factors. For example, we do not maintain insurance against risks related to violations of environmental laws or damages resulting from hydraulic fracturing. We would be negatively affected by a significant adverse event that is not fully covered by insurance.\nWe face competition from larger oil and gas companies, which could result in adverse effects on our business.\nThe exploration and production business is highly competitive. Many of our competitors have substantially larger financial resources, staffs, and facilities. Our competitors in Poland and the United States include major oil and gas exploration and production companies.\nOur Operating Losses\nWe have a history of operating net losses and may require additional capital in the future to fund our operations.\nFrom our inception in January 1989 through December 31, 2014, we have incurred cumulative net losses of approximately $258 million. Our exploration and production activities may continue to result in net losses through 2015 and possibly beyond, depending on whether our activities in Poland and the United States are successful and result in sufficient revenues to cover related operating expenses.\nUntil sufficient cash flow from operations can be obtained, we expect we will need additional capital to fully fund our ongoing planned exploration, appraisal, development, and property maintenance and acquisition programs in Poland. In addition to our long-term project financing, we may seek required funds from the issuance of additional debt, equity, or hybrid securities; project financing; strategic alliances; or other arrangements. Obtaining additional financing may dilute the interest of our existing stockholders or our interest in the specific project being financed. We cannot assure that additional funds could be obtained or, if obtained, would be on terms favorable to us. In addition to planned activities in Poland and the United States, we may require additional funds for general corporate purposes.\nWe may incur additional noncash losses due to exchange-rate fluctuations.\nContinuing fluctuations in the rates at which U.S. dollars are exchanged into Polish zlotys may result in ongoing noncash exchange-rate losses. As the dollar strengthens relative to the zloty, our dollar-denominated revenue received in zlotys declines; conversely, when the dollar weakens relative to the zloty, our dollar-denominated revenue received in zlotys increases. Should exchange rates in effect during early 2015 continue throughout the year, we expect the exchange rates to have a negative impact on our dollar-denominated revenues in 2015 compared to 2014, with a corresponding decrease in the dollar cost of our capital expenditures in Poland. Applicable exchange rates may be adversely affected by continuing European economic stagnation, the consequences within the European Union of recent political changes in Greece, the collateral consequences of Russia\u2019s weakening economy and regional political and economic repercussions from its actions in Ukraine and elsewhere, the fallout from related economic sanctions on Russia and its actual or potential reaction, and other factors.\nGas Prices and Marketing\nThe price we receive for gas in Poland is currently partially determined based on trailing Russian prices and, as a consequence of lower oil prices, may decrease in the future.\nAs in previous years, the prices at which we sell gas in Poland to PGNiG are determined pursuant to published tariffs for gas sold to wholesale consumers. These tariffs are determined, in part, by reference to the cost of Russian imported gas, the price of which, in turn, is based in part on trailing oil prices. The trailing impact of lower oil prices may have a depressive effect on such tariffs and so may reduce the price that we receive for our gas from PGNiG. Conversely, because the tariffs are determined in part by trailing prices, increases in oil prices may result in higher tariffs for the gas we sell in Poland. Changes in the mechanism for determining the applicable tariff may also result in lower prices for gas that we may sell.\nChanges in Polish gas markets and pricing may have an adverse impact on our operations.\nMarket influences are shifting gas prices away from indexing to oil prices, with about half of the gas consumed in Western Europe no longer indexed to oil. In addition, the European Union is pressuring Poland to eliminate tariffs and move toward market pricing. Poland has started trading gas on its commodity exchange, but prices are not considered representative because transactions are dominated by sales from PGNiG to its wholly owned retail trading subsidiary. Imports into Poland from Germany at market prices have reduced PGNiG\u2019s pricing domination. As a result of the foregoing factors, we believe that Poland\u2019s reliance on tariff pricing may decline and that Poland\u2019s gas prices may increasingly be influenced by world gas prices, which in turn may be influenced by Russia\u2019s export policies; the availability to Western Europe of liquefied natural gas (LNG); Asian demand; U.S. gas production; European economic performance; and European Union strategies to move to uniform, market-driven carbon content pricing across various fuels and limit reliance on coal. We cannot predict the effect these changes in Poland\u2019s gas marketing landscape will have on the prices we receive for the gas that we produce in Poland.\nAll of our natural gas currently produced in Poland is sold to a single purchaser, PGNiG, or its affiliates.\nWe currently sell all of the natural gas we produce in Poland to PGNiG or one of its affiliates. If PGNiG were to fail to perform its obligations under contracts with us, it would most likely have a material adverse effect on us. The market for the sale of gas in Poland is open to competition, but there are not yet many market participants. While our contracts provide us with the ability to market gas to other purchasers, including those outside of Poland, we do not expect to diversify our gas purchasers in the foreseeable future for production located in our Fences project area.\nOil and gas price volatility could adversely affect our operations and our ability to obtain financing.\nOil and gas prices have been and are likely to continue to be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to the following factors:\n\u25cf\nthe market and price structure in markets locally and in Russia, on which Polish gas tariffs are currently based;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the mechanism for determining the applicable tariff for pricing gas;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the supply of and demand for oil and gas as the European Union seeks to limit reliance on buying Russian gas;\n\u25cf\nmarket uncertainty;\n\u25cf\nthe opening of a new natural gas exchange in Poland;\n\u25cf\nRussia\u2019s gas export policies;\n\u25cf\nthe impact of potential climate change on oil and gas demand and prices;\n\u25cf\nthe availability to Western Europe of liquefied natural gas (LNG);\n\u25cf\nAsian demand;\n\u25cf\npolitical conditions in international oil- and gas-producing regions;\n\u25cf\nthe extent of production and importation of oil and gas into existing or potential markets;\n\u25cf\nthe level of consumer demand;\n\u25cf\nweather conditions affecting production, transportation, and consumption;\n\u25cf\nthe competitive position of gas or oil as a source of energy, as compared with coal, nuclear energy, hydroelectric power, alternative energy, and other energy sources, as the European Union moves toward uniform, market-driven carbon content pricing across various fuels;\n\u25cf\nthe availability, proximity, and capacity of gathering systems, pipelines, and processing facilities;\n\u25cf\nthe processing and refining capacity of prospective gas or oil purchasers;\n\u25cf\nthe effect of governmental regulation on the production, transportation, and sale of oil and gas; and\n\u25cf\nother factors beyond our control.\nWe have not entered into any agreements, including hedging arrangements, to protect us from price fluctuations and may or may not do so in the future.\nThe effects of global climate change could adversely impact the market demand for oil and gas products and negatively impact our business.\nThe value of our oil and gas exploration, development, and production activities is and will continue to be a function of the market demand for oil and gas products. If global climate change results in rising average global temperatures, the market demand for oil and gas products used in residential and commercial heating fuels may decrease. This could result in a decrease in demand for oil and gas products and negatively impact our business.\nConcerns regarding global climate change could spur legislation or regulation, globalized through treaties or otherwise, that could diminish global demand for oil and gas products and negatively impact our business.\nOur oil and gas exploration, development, and production activities in Poland are subject to Poland\u2019s laws and regulations, some of which are designed to meet the requirements of the European Union. Future legislation and regulation could be a part of globalized efforts similar to the Kyoto Protocol, regional systems such as the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme, or other campaigns in response to concerns regarding global climate change. These laws or regulations could result in taxes or direct limitations on the production of fossil fuels that could diminish global market demand for oil and gas products or curtail or limit our activities in Poland and correspondingly have a negative impact on our business.\nRegulatory Contingencies\nWe spent a total of $321,000 in prior years for oil leak cleanup costs and may incur additional significant costs related to this or other environmental matters.\nFollowing a June 2011 oil leak at our Southwest Cut Bank Sand Unit in Montana, we spent approximately $321,000 in completing cleanup, mitigation, and restoration pursuant to an approved plan in cooperation with the Blackfeet Tribe and the United States Environmental Protection Agency, commonly referred to as the EPA. We cannot assure that the satisfactory completion of the cleanup according to the specifications provided by the Blackfeet Tribe and the EPA will not result in additional costs or civil or criminal sanctions. Investigation into the 2011 Southwest Cut Bank Sand Unit incident continues, and we cannot predict whether authorities may initiate criminal or other proceedings against us or our personnel, exposing us or our employees to penalties. Our efforts to limit our exposure to such liability and cost may prove inadequate and result in a significant adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, it is possible that the increasingly strict requirements imposed by environmental laws and enforcement policies could require us to make significant capital expenditures. Such capital expenditures could adversely impact our cash flows and our financial condition.\nWe may incur significant litigation or settlement costs as a result of actual or threatened litigation that could have an adverse effect on our business.\nFrom time to time we may be a defendant in various lawsuits, including civil or criminal proceedings based on environmental claims. The nature of our operations exposes us to further possible threats of litigation or actual litigation claims in the future. When we or our personnel are threatened with civil ligation or criminal charges, we may seek early resolution through settlement and may agree to payments or sanctions greater than might be determined after trial. Further, we may agree to sanctions informally in order to avoid further proceedings or more significant charges. Finally, we may assume Company responsibility to keep our personnel from individual liability or charges for activities undertaken by them on our behalf and for which they may be entitled to indemnification. There is risk that any civil or criminal litigation could be decided unfavorably against us regardless of our belief, opinion, and position, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow. Litigation can be very costly, and the costs associated with defending litigation could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Adverse litigation decisions or rulings may damage our business reputation and cause collateral consequences we do not foresee.\nCompliance with environmental requirements may not be offset by our limited oil production revenue in Montana.\nWe have limited oil production in Montana, so substantial environmental compliance, mitigation, and reclamation costs may not be offset by revenue from ongoing production from the wells or facilities involved in any incident or even the entire field. Accordingly, environmental costs expose our entire Montana operations, and the subsidiary through which these operations are conducted, to risk. As an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties in the United States, we are subject to various federal, tribal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations, subject the lessee to liability for pollution damages, require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas, and expose us to civil and criminal sanctions or fines, with attendant negative publicity.\nOur U.S. operations are subject to governmental risks that may impact our operations.\nOur U.S. operations have been, and at times in the future may be, affected by political developments and by federal, state, tribal, and local laws and regulations such as restrictions on production; changes in taxes, royalties, and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies; price or gathering rate controls; and environmental protection laws and regulations. New political developments, laws, and regulations may adversely impact our results on operations.\nPolish legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could make it more difficult or costly for us to explore and produce from our properties.\nWe may use hydraulic fracturing in vertical and horizontal wells in Poland to enhance oil and natural gas production. Hydraulic fracturing is a process that involves injecting water, sand, and chemicals into the foundation under high pressure to fracture the surrounding rock to stimulate production.\nRecent changes in Poland\u2019s regulations require us to apply for and obtain a permit before fracturing any well and impose reporting and disclosure obligations regarding hydraulic fracturing activities, which could cause operational delays, increase operating costs, and add regulatory burdens on our exploration and production activities. This could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing, resulting in reduced amounts of oil and natural gas being produced and booked as reserves in the future, delayed exploration and development, and increased costs of compliance and doing business. Such consequences could limit the potential upside of any activities we undertake in Poland.\nThe demand for hydraulic fracturing expertise and equipment may make it difficult for us to complete any hydraulic fracturing we might plan.\nOil and gas exploration firms in Poland have expanded their use of hydraulic fracturing, and the resulting demand on the availability of third parties with fracturing expertise and equipment, particularly in Poland, may make it difficult for us to complete planned fracturing activities within estimated schedules or budgets.\nOur activities may be directly or indirectly adversely affected by unauthorized invasion of our data processing and communications systems.\nWe are dependent on a number of computerized data storage and processing and communications systems to operate our business and interconnect our activities in Poland and Montana with our principal executive offices in Utah. We use these systems to gather and store raw exploration, development, and production data; interpret geophysical and geological data as part of our exploration and development activities; model the resource potential and reserves or project areas; forecast production; administer contracts with third parties; gather and report financial and other data to our stockholders and regulatory authorities; and complete other critical functions throughout the company. Our vendors and suppliers also rely on similar systems in conducting their own businesses. Our reliance, like others in the industry, on these technologies makes us increasingly vulnerable to risks of technological failures resulting from others gaining unauthorized access, intentional and unintentional cyber incidents, network failures, breaches of security, and similar events that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss, destruction of proprietary and other information, including the release of such information to competitors, or other damaging disruption of our activities. We cannot assure that the measures we implement to protect against these kinds of cyber risks will be successful or that our operations will not be adversely affected by cyber events. We expect that the financial and managerial resources that we devote to protective measures or to remediate breaches will increase.\nOur oil and gas operations are subject to changing environmental laws and regulations that could have a negative impact on our operations.\nOperations on our project areas are subject to environmental laws and regulations in Poland that provide for restrictions and prohibitions on spills, releases, or emissions of various substances produced in association with oil and gas exploration and development. We cannot predict the full impact on our operations of significant amendments in 2014 to governing laws respecting environmental compliance, the concessions system, and other matters. Additionally, if significant quantities of gas are produced with oil, regulations prohibiting the flaring of gas may inhibit oil production. In these circumstances, the absence of a gas-gathering and delivering system may restrict production or may require significant expenditures to develop such a system prior to producing oil and gas. We are required to prepare and obtain approval of environmental impact assessments by governmental authorities in Poland prior to commencing gas or oil production, transportation, and processing functions. We are also subject to the requirements of Natura 2000, which is an ecological network in the territory of the European Union. In May 1992, governments of the European Union adopted legislation designed to protect the most seriously threatened habitats and species across Europe.\nNeither our partners nor we can assure that we have complied with all applicable laws and regulations in drilling wells, acquiring seismic data, or completing other activities in Poland to date. The Polish government may adopt more restrictive regulations or administrative policies or practices. The cost of compliance with current regulations or any changes in environmental regulations could require significant expenditures. Further, breaches of these regulations may result in the imposition of fines and penalties, any of which may be material. These environmental costs could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows in the future.\nRisks Relating to Conducting Business in Poland\nPoland is indirectly affected by economic and political changes in Russia, which is Poland\u2019s neighbor to the east.\nRussia is currently experiencing economic and political changes resulting from reduced world prices for oil, a principal export; an overall stressed economy; political fallout from its actions in Ukraine, including Crimea; Western European and U.S. economic sanctions against Russia and Russia\u2019s reactions to those sanctions; and other factors. Russia currently exports substantial quantities of gas to Poland and Western Europe at prices Russia establishes. These imports influence gas prices in those areas. Any interruption or long-term curtailment of Russian gas exports could create pressure to increase short-term gas prices in Poland and Western Europe, but may have adverse long-term impacts on the economies of Poland and Western Europe, which could adversely affect our activities in Poland.\nA substantial amount of our revenues is attributable to our operations in Poland.\nAny disruption in production, development, or our ability to produce and sell oil and gas in Poland would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or reduce future revenues.\nPolish laws, regulations, and policies may be changed in ways that could adversely impact our business.\nOur oil and gas exploration, development, and production activities in Poland are and will continue to be subject to ongoing uncertainties and risks, including:\n\u25cf\npossible changes in government personnel, the development of new administrative policies, and practices and political conditions in Poland that may affect the administration of agreements with governmental agencies or enterprises;\n\u25cf\npossible changes to the laws, regulations, and policies applicable to our partners and us or the oil and gas industry in Poland in general;\n\u25cf\nthe potential adoption of an entirely new regulatory regime for the exploration, development, extraction, and taxation of all natural resources, including oil and gas;\n\u25cf\nuncertainties as to whether the laws and regulations will be applicable in any particular circumstance;\n\u25cf\nuncertainties as to whether we will be able to enforce our rights in Poland;\n\u25cf\nuncertainty as to whether we will be able to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Polish authorities, PGNiG\u2019s and our compliance with governmental requirements respecting exploration expenditures, results of exploration, environmental protection matters, and other factors;\n\u25cf\nthe inability to recover previous payments to the Polish government made under the exploration rights or any other costs incurred respecting those rights if we were to lose or cancel our exploration and exploitation rights at any time;\n\u25cf\npolitical instability and possible changes in government;\n\u25cf\nexport and transportation tariffs;\n\u25cf\nlocal and national tax requirements;\n\u25cf\nexpropriation or nationalization of private enterprises and other risks arising out of foreign government sovereignty over our acreage in Poland; and\n\u25cf\npossible significant delays in obtaining opinions of local authorities or satisfying other governmental requirements in connection with a grant of permits to conduct exploration and production activities.\nOur operations are concentrated in Poland such that any impediment to these operations would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nPoland has a developing regulatory regime, regulatory policies, and interpretations.\nPoland has a regulatory regime governing exploration and development, production, marketing, transportation, and storage of oil and gas. These provisions were promulgated during the past two decades and are relatively untested. Therefore, there is little or no administrative or enforcement history or established practice that can aid us in evaluating how the regulatory regime will affect our operations. It is possible those governmental policies will change or that new laws and regulations, administrative practices or policies, or interpretations of existing laws and regulations will materially and adversely affect our activities in Poland. For example, many of Poland\u2019s laws, policies, and procedures were changed to conform to the requirements that had to be met before Poland was admitted as a full member of the European Union. Further, since the history and practice of industry regulation is sparse, our activities may be particularly vulnerable to the decisions and positions of individuals, who may change, be subject to external pressures, or administer policies inconsistently. Internal bureaucratic politics may have unpredictable and negative consequences.\nPrivatization or nationalization of PGNiG could affect our relationship and future opportunities in Poland.\nOur activities in Poland have benefited from our relationship with PGNiG, which has provided us with exploration acreage, seismic data, expertise, and production data under our agreements. The Polish government commenced the privatization of PGNiG by selling PGNiG\u2019s refining assets in the mid-90s and by successfully completing an initial public offering of approximately 15% of its stock. Recently, PGNiG has announced plans to privatize its service affiliates, including the geophysical and drilling companies that we regularly engage. Complete privatization or a re-nationalization of PGNiG may result in new policies, strategies, or ownership that could adversely affect our existing relationship and agreements, as well as the availability of opportunities with PGNiG in the future.\nWe are dependent on PGNiG to accurately account for expenditures on our behalf and for which we are responsible.\nMany of our activities in Poland are undertaken in collaboration with PGNiG, which frequently owns a majority of the interest in the project and acts as operator under our agreements. As operator, PGNiG incurs costs for agreed activities, such as gathering seismic data, drilling and completing wells, constructing production facilities, and other costs, and we are obligated to advance or reimburse our share of these costs. We have limited rights to audit or otherwise examine the records of reimbursable expenditures on our behalf. The limitation on our rights and our inability to undertake audits to determine compliance with our agreements may expose us to overcharges or other irregularities.\nCertain risks of loss arise from our need to conduct transactions in foreign currency.\nThe amounts in our agreements relating to our activities in Poland are sometimes expressed and payable in U.S. dollars and sometimes in Polish zlotys. In the future, our financial results and cash flows in Poland may be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates between the zloty and the dollar for dollar-denominated agreements. Other currencies used by us may not be convertible at satisfactory rates. In addition, the official conversion rates between U.S. and Polish currencies may not accurately reflect the relative value of goods and services available or required in Poland. Further, inflation may lead to the devaluation of the Polish zloty.\nThe ongoing European sovereign debt crises and collateral financial issues may adversely affect our ability to borrow money.\nOur Senior Secured Credit Facility is financed with two European banks. Although both lending banks in our credit facility recently successfully passed required European bank stress tests, there is no guarantee that they will maintain their required capital and other ratios, and our access to the remaining available funds may be adversely affected in view of the continuing unresolved sovereign debt conditions in Europe, the unsettled circumstances surrounding the secondary credit crisis in Europe, and the uncertain success of efforts to resolve the Euro crisis. These factors may adversely impact the capital stability of our lenders as well as other lenders from which we might seek additional or replacement financing.\nThe Polish Ministry of the Environment has the authority to terminate immediately the mining usufruct agreements and may impose contractual penalties if we do not comply with the terms and obligations indicated in such agreements.\nPursuant to the Polish Geological and Mining Law, a mining usufruct is the right to carry out work connected with prospecting and exploring for, or extracting, oil and gas. A mining usufruct is established based on an agreement concluded with the Polish State Treasury, in that case represented by the Polish Ministry of the Environment. The provisions respecting mining usufruct fees continue to evolve and may be more stringent in more recent and future usufructs. Under newer usufructs, the Polish Ministry of the Environment has the authority, if we fail to comply with the terms and obligations indicated in the mining usufruct agreement, in particular with the obligation to pay fees due under the agreement, to terminate immediately a mining usufruct agreement, and may impose on us a contractual penalty in an amount equal to up to 200% of the annual fixed component of the fees. We anticipate that usufructs will continue to include higher fixed and variable payment requirements, and increased penalties or other sanctions, for nonpayment. We cannot ensure that we have complied, and will comply, with all the terms and obligations imposed on us under the mining usufruct agreements. The loss of the usufruct rights under the mining usufruct agreements would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur operations in Poland require our compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\nWe must conduct our activities in or related to Poland in compliance with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and similar anti-bribery laws that generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Enforcement officials interpret the FCPA\u2019s prohibition on improper payments to government officials to apply to officials of state-owned enterprises such as PGNiG, our principal partner in Poland. While our employees and agents are required to acknowledge and comply with these laws, we cannot assure that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws, despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics. The occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may adversely affect our business, performance, prospects, value, financial condition, reputation, and results of operations.\nWe cannot predict the impact of the recently adopted Polish Hydrocarbon Industry Tax Regime on our activities.\nIn 2014, Poland enacted the Polish Hydrocarbon Industry Tax Regime and adopted implementing regulations to become effective over the next several years. In addition to increased royalties, new laws have been enacted regarding two new taxes on hydrocarbons, one based on positive cumulative cash flows from hydrocarbon activity and the other based on production volumes. The new legislation is meant to increase governmental revenue from the oil and gas industry, with the stated intention for the total royalty and tax burden of an energy company to approach 40% of taxable income, which is approximately double that of the current fiscal regime. The new laws will become effective January 1, 2016, respecting the royalty regime, and January 1, 2020, respecting new taxes. The new royalty and tax structure would be applicable to all production, without regard to when the well was drilled or the relevant concession granted. Aside from stated royalty increases, we cannot predict whether the different taxation regime will impact our operations or cash flows. We cannot assure that industry resistance to these new burdens will result in modifications before the new provisions become fully implemented in 2020.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nOur ability to obtain equity capital will be adversely affected because of the relatively low prices at which our securities are currently traded.\nIn the past, we have obtained external capital from time to time by selling equity securities in the public market and have an effective universal shelf registration statement permitting us to sell publicly up to $179.3 million of equity or debt securities of various kinds. Although our common stock traded as high as $5.65 per share between January 1 and December 31, 2014, it reached a five-year low in early 2015 of $1.20 per share, and as of March 11, 2015, traded at approximately $1.69. A low trading price for our common stock may make it impracticable or financially unattractive to seek equity through the sale of common stock. If we do determine to seek equity at relatively low prices, the sale of stock at these prices may dilute the stock ownership and value of existing stockholders.\nOur stockholder rights plan and bylaws discourage unsolicited takeover proposals and could prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium on our common stock.\nWe have a revised stockholder rights plan that we propose to submit to the stockholders for approval at the 2015 annual meeting that may have the effect of discouraging unsolicited takeover proposals. The rights issued under the stockholder rights plan, if approved, would cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved in advance by our board of directors. In addition, our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that our stockholders may consider to be in their best interests that include:\n\u25cf\nmembers of the board of directors are elected in rotation; and\n\u25cf\nthe ability of the board of directors to designate the terms of, and to issue new series of, preferred shares.\nTogether, these provisions and our stockholder rights plan may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment to our stockholders of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common shares.\nOur common stock price has been and may continue to be extremely volatile.\nOur common stock has closed as low as $1.20 per share and as high as $5.65 per share between January 1, 2014, and the date of this report. Some of the factors leading to this volatility include:\n\u25cf\nthe outcome of individual wells or the timing of exploration efforts in Poland and the United States;\n\u25cf\nthe potential sale by us of newly issued common stock to raise capital;\n\u25cf\nmarket reactions to political and economic circumstances in Europe and, in particular, in Russia;\n\u25cf\nEuropean gas prices and currency exchange-rate uncertainties;\n\u25cf\nprice and volume fluctuations in the general securities markets that are unrelated to our results of operations;\n\u25cf\nthe investment community\u2019s view of companies with assets and operations outside the United States in general and in Poland in particular;\n\u25cf\nactions or announcements by our partners that may affect us;\n\u25cf\nannounced drilling or other exploration results by others in or near the areas of our activities;\n\u25cf\nturmoil in the financial sector that may impact our Senior Secured Credit Facility;\n\u25cf\nprevailing world prices for oil and gas;\n\u25cf\nchanges in regulatory environments or taxation measures that may adversely affect the trading prices for our common stock;\n\u25cf\nthe potential of our current and planned activities in Poland and the United States;\n\u25cf\nchanges in stock market analysts\u2019 recommendations regarding us, other oil and gas companies, or the oil and gas industry in general; and\n\u25cf\nall other risks as previously discussed.\nOur current rating by third-party corporate governance consultants advising institutional stockholders may result in recommendations that incumbent directors not be reelected or against the approval of other matters in accordance with management\u2019s recommendations.\nVarious corporate governance consultants advising institutional investors and others provide scores or ratings of our governance measures, nominees for election as directors, whether our executive compensation practices effectively incentivize performance, and other matters that may be submitted to the stockholders for consideration. We expect that certain nominees or matters that we propose for approval from time to time may not merit a favorable score or rating or may result in a negative score or rating or recommendation that the nominee or matter be rejected. We believe that approximately 30% of our stock may be held by institutions that may be advised directly by these consultants. Other stockholders consider the ratings and recommendations of proxy advisers as well. Certain of our stockholders have raised concerns similar to those noted by proxy advisers. Accordingly, unfavorable scores or ratings by such consultants could adversely affect our ability to obtain reelection of incumbent directors or the approval of other matters in accordance with management\u2019s recommendations. We have reviewed certain governance measures and implemented changes that we believe are significant and responsive to some concerns that have been raised, but we have not changed other things that we believe are in the best interests of our stockholders, notwithstanding the adverse effect of these provisions on our scores or ratings.", "PERMNO": 83659, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "FXEN"}
