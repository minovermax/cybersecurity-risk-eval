RISK FACTORS.\nRisks Relating to Ownership Structure\nThe controlling shareholder group may be able to vote its shares in favor of its interests that may not always coincide with the interests of shareholders not part of such group. This risk may be counter-balanced to a degree by the actions of the Board of Directors whose composition is made up of a majority of independent directors.\nThe controlling shareholder group includes a corporation that owns a significant percentage of the Company\u2019s common stock and which does business with the Company, as further described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In theory, this could result in a conflict of interest; nevertheless, the Company and its largest shareholder have put in place some controls to reduce the effects of any perceived conflict of interest.\nCertain conflicts of interest may be perceived by the relationship between the Company and its largest shareholder. Both entities have the same Chief Executive Officer, and certain management personnel work for both entities. Nevertheless, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors (\u201cBoard\u201d) is composed of a majority of independent directors. As recently as 2005, in a case involving both entities, the Delaware Supreme Court in connection with an attempt to obtain books and records of the Company through a proceeding against the Company\u2019s significant shareholder, held that the actions of the Company\u2019s Board were proper.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe are a part of the communities in which we do business. Accordingly, like other businesses in our communities, we are subject to the following risks:\n\u25cf the continued threat of terrorism;\n\u25cf economic downturns, both on a national and on local scales;\n\u25cf loss of key personnel;\n\u25cf the availability, if needed, of additional financing;\n\u25cf the continued availability of insurance (in different types of policies) at reasonably acceptable rates;\n\u25cf the general burdens of governmental regulation, at the Local, State and Federal levels;\n\u25cf climate change; and\n\u25cf cyber security.\nRisks Related to Real Estate Operations\nOur investment in property development may be limited by increasing costs required to \u201cfit up\u201d property to be leased to tenants. Also, as the cost of fitting up properties increases, we may be required to wait and forsake opportunities that would be revenue producing until such time that we obtain the necessary financing of such ventures. This risk may be mitigated by our obtaining lines of credit and other financing vehicles, although such have significant limitations on the amounts that may be borrowed at any point in time.\nWe also may be subject to environmental liability as an owner or operator of properties. Many of our properties are old and when we need to fit up a property for a new tenant, we may find materials and the like that could be deemed to contain hazardous elements requiring remediation or encapsulation.\nWe try to lease our properties to tenants with adequate finances, but as a result of the economic downturn, even formerly financially strong tenants may be at risk. The Company is trying to mitigate the latter by leasing our properties to multiple tenants where applicable in order to diversify the tenant base.\nRisks Related to our Investments\nExcess cash and cash equivalents may be invested from time to time. We seek to earn rates of return that will help us finance our business operations. These investments may be subject to significant uncertainties and may not be successful for many reasons, including, but not limited to the following:\n\u25cf fluctuations in interest rates;\n\u25cf worsening of general economic and market conditions; and\n\u25cf adverse legal, financial and regulatory developments that may affect a particular business.\nRisk Factors Summary\nThese are some of the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d that could affect the Company\u2019s business. The Company endeavors to take actions and do business in a way that reduces these \u201cRisk Factors\u201d or, at least, takes them into account when conducting its business. Nevertheless, some of these \u201cRisk Factors\u201d cannot be avoided so that the Company must also take actions and do business that negates the adverse effects that these may have on the Company.", "PERMNO": 27617, "SIC": 6512, "TIC": "MAYS"}
