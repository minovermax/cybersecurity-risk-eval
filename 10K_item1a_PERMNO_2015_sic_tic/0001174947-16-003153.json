{"cik": "65312", "company": "EnviroStar, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-09-20", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock. The risks described below are not the only risks faced by the Company. Additional risks not presently known to the Company or other factors that the Company does not presently perceive to present significant risks to the Company at this time may also impair the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, or the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nAcquisitions could result in operating difficulties, dilution, and other consequences that may adversely impact the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nAcquisitions are an important element of the Company\u2019s growth strategy and are expected to be material to the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. The Company expects to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding acquisitions and other potential strategic transactions. However, the Company may not be successful in consummating acquisitions or other strategic transactions as expected, including in the time frame anticipated, or at all. Expenses related to the Company\u2019s pursuit of acquisitions and other strategic transactions may be significant and will be incurred by the Company regardless of whether the underlying acquisition or other strategic transaction is ultimately consummated.\nAcquisitions and the Company\u2019s efforts with respect thereto, including efforts with respect to the integration of acquired businesses, may use significant resources, result in disruptions to the Company\u2019s business operations, result in distractions of management and not proceed as planned, and they could expose the Company to unforeseen liabilities. These involve a number of special problems and risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7 difficulty integrating acquired technologies, products, services, operations, customers and personnel;\n\u00b7 diversion of management\u2019s attention;\n\u00b7 strain on managerial and operational resources as management tries to oversee larger operations;\n\u00b7 difficulty implementing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting at the acquired businesses; and\n\u00b7 exposure to unforeseen liabilities of the acquired businesses.\nAs a result of these or other problems and risks, businesses the Company may acquire may not produce the revenues, earnings, cash flows or business synergies anticipated, and the acquired businesses may not perform as expected. As a result, the Company may incur higher costs and realize lower revenues and earnings than anticipated. The Company may not be able to successfully address these problems, integrate any acquired businesses or generate sufficient revenue to offset the associated costs or other negative effects on its business.\nIn addition, acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of the Company\u2019s equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses, or impairment of goodwill and/or purchased long-lived assets, and restructuring charges, any of which could harm the Company\u2019s financial condition or results.\nFurther, businesses that grow rapidly often have difficulty managing their growth. If the Company is successful in growing through acquisitions, such growth may place significant demands on management, as well as on the Company\u2019s accounting, financial, information and other systems and on the Company\u2019s business. Management may not be able to manage the Company\u2019s growth effectively or successfully, and the Company\u2019s financial, accounting, information and other systems may not be able to successfully accommodate the Company\u2019s growth.\nThe proposed acquisition of Western State Design may not be completed on a timely basis, on anticipated terms, or at all, and there are uncertainties and risks relating to the transaction.\nAs previously described, on September 7, 2016, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Western State Design and its members, pursuant to which the Company, indirectly through a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary, has agreed to acquire substantially all of the assets and assume certain liabilities of Western State Design. The total consideration for the Western State Design Acquisition will be equal to $28,000,000, consisting of (i) cash consideration of $18,000,000 (subject to certain net working capital and other adjustments) and (ii) 2,044,990 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. In addition, in connection with the financing of the Western State Design Acquisition, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Symmetric Capital II, a company controlled by Henry M. Nahmad, the Manager of Symmetric Capital II and the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President and controlling stockholder of the Company. Pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Company agreed to issue and sell to Symmetric Capital II in a Private Placement an aggregate of 1,290,323 shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock for a total purchase price of approximately $6,000,000. Subject to certain closing conditions, including a financing condition and the approval by the NYSE MKT of the listing of the Private Placement Shares, the closing of the Private Placement is expected to occur immediately prior to the closing of the Western State Design Acquisition. Accordingly, the Company expects to issue a total of 3,335,313 shares of its common stock in connection with the Western State Design Acquisition and the Private Placement. Based on the number of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock currently outstanding, the issuance of shares in connection with the Western State Design Acquisition and the Private Placement would result in an approximately 47% increase in the total number of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock immediately and therefore would result in substantial dilution to the Company\u2019s stockholders. Further, closing of the Western State Design Acquisition is conditioned upon the members of the Selling Group entering into a Stockholders Agreement with Symmetric Capital II and certain of its affiliates, including Mr. Nahmad, pursuant to which, among other things, the members of the Selling Group will agree to vote all of the shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock owned by them at any time during the term of the Stockholders Agreement as directed by Mr. Nahmad, as the Manager of Symmetric Capital II, and grant to Mr. Nahmad, as the Manager of Symmetric Capital II, an irrevocable proxy and power of attorney in furtherance thereof. Accordingly, Mr. Nahmad, who currently has voting power over approximately 50.3% of the outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock, will, as the Manager of Symmetric Capital II, have voting power over all of the shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock issued in connection with the Western State Design Acquisition and the Private Placement, and the transactions will therefore increase Mr. Nahmad\u2019s voting power with respect to the Company. See the risk factor captioned \u201cHenry M. Nahmad may be deemed to control the Company\u201d below for risks related to Mr. Nahmad\u2019s control position with respect to the Company.\nClosing of the Western State Design Acquisition is also subject to certain other closing conditions, including, but not limited to, (i) the Company obtaining, on terms and conditions acceptable to the Company, satisfactory debt and equity financing sufficient to fund the cash consideration; (ii) the approval by the NYSE MKT of the listing of the shares to be issued at the closing of the Western State Design Acquisition; (iii) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the parties; and (iv) the parties\u2019 performance and compliance in all material respects with the agreements and covenants contained in the Asset Purchase Agreement. There is no assurance that the Western State Design Acquisition will be completed on the contemplated terms, when anticipated, or at all, or that, if completed, the Western State Design Acquisition will have a positive impact on the Company or its business, operating results or financial condition.\nFurther, as previously described, the Company has obtained a debt financing commitment from Wells Fargo for senior secured financing facilities in the maximum aggregate amount of up to $20,000,000, approximately $12,000,000 of which the Company intends to use to finance the balance of the cash consideration to be paid in connection with the Western State Design Acquisition not funded by\nthe net proceeds of the Private Placement. See the risk factor captioned \u201cThe Company\u2019s indebtedness may impact its financial condition and results of operations, and the terms of the Company\u2019s indebtedness may limit its activities\u201d below for risks related to the Company\u2019s indebtedness.\nIf the Company fails to collect its accounts receivable or is required to increase its allowance for doubtful accounts, its operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. As of June 30, 2016, the Company\u2019s accounts receivable were approximately $2.0 million, and its allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately $160,000. Accounts and trade notes receivable due from two customers accounted for 33% of the Company\u2019s accounts and trade notes receivable at June 30, 2016. There is no assurance that the Company will collect its outstanding accounts receivable or that its allowance for doubtful accounts will be adequate. The failure to collect outstanding receivables could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, prospects, operating results or financial condition. Further, if the Company is required to make additional allowances, including, without limitation, in the event the financial condition of the Company\u2019s customers was to deteriorate and, for that reason or based on other factors, their ability to make required payments was impaired, then the Company\u2019s operating results for the period in which the determination or allowance is or was made would be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s indebtedness may impact its financial condition and results of operations, and the terms of the Company\u2019s indebtedness may limit its activities.\nThe Company\u2019s level of indebtedness may have several important effects on the Company\u2019s operations, including, without limitation, that the Company may be required to use a portion of its cash flow for the payment of principal and interest due on outstanding indebtedness, that outstanding indebtedness and the Company\u2019s leverage position will increase the impact on the Company of negative changes in general economic and industry conditions, as well as competitive pressures, and that the Company\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing for acquisitions, working capital or other corporate purposes may be impacted.\nThe Company has a revolving line of credit facility pursuant to which the Company may borrow up to $2,250,000. Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at 2.50% per annum above the Adjusted LIBOR Market Index Rate. Accordingly, if interest rates increase, then the amount of the interest payments on any outstanding indebtedness under the credit facility or any other floating rate debt the Company may incur in the future will also increase. The Company\u2019s obligations under the credit facility are guaranteed by the Company\u2019s subsidiaries and collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries. The loan agreement pursuant to which the revolving line of credit has been made available to the Company requires maintenance of certain fixed charge coverage and leverage ratios and contains other restrictive covenants, including limitations on the extent to which the Company and its subsidiaries could incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends, guarantee indebtedness of others, grant liens, sell assets and make investments. The credit facility will expire on, and the maturity date for borrowings under the credit facility is, November 1, 2016. While the Company anticipates that it will seek to extend the credit facility, the Company may not be successful in doing so or entering into an additional or replacement facility, in each case, on acceptable terms, or at all. No amounts were outstanding under the credit facility at June 30, 2016.\nThe Company also expects to seek debt financing in connection with its pursuit of acquisitions as part of its buy-and-build growth strategy. As previously described, in connection with the financing of the Western State Design Acquisition, the Company has obtained a debt financing commitment from Wells Fargo for senior secured financing facilities in the maximum aggregate amount of up to $20,000,000. In addition, the Company may seek to incur additional debt financing as determined to be appropriate by management. In connection therewith, the Company may seek to increase its current credit facility and/or enter into new credit facilities or other financing arrangements with lenders. However, the Company may not be able to increase its credit facility or otherwise incur additional debt on acceptable terms, or at all,\nincluding in the event additional funds are necessary to consummate an acquisition or support the Company\u2019s business operations.\nThe products the Company sells could fail to perform according to specification or prove to be unreliable, which could damage the Company\u2019s customer relationships and industry reputation and result in lawsuits and loss of sales.\nThe Company\u2019s customers require demanding specifications for product performance and reliability. Product defects or other failures to perform to specifications or as expected could result in higher service costs and may damage the Company\u2019s customer relationships and industry reputation and/or otherwise negatively impact the Company\u2019s sales and business. Further, the Company may be subject to lawsuits if any of the products it distributes fails to operate properly or causes property or other physical damage.\nThe Company\u2019s business and results may be adversely affected if the Company does not maintain its relationships with its significant suppliers or customers.\nThe Company purchases the products it distributes from a number of manufacturers and suppliers. Three of these manufacturers accounted for a total of approximately 68% of the Company\u2019s product purchases for fiscal 2016, and two manufacturers accounted for a total of approximately 54% of the Company\u2019s product purchases for fiscal 2015. While the Company has not historically experienced difficulty in purchasing products it distributes, and believes it has good working relationships with the manufacturers or suppliers from which the Company purchases its products, if such relationships deteriorate or the Company is unable to maintain such relationships, including with any of the three manufacturers referred to above, the Company\u2019s business and results could be materially and adversely impacted. Further, while the Company has contracts with two of the three significant manufacturers referred to above, it does not have a contract with the third significant manufacturer or with several of the other manufacturers and suppliers of the products it distributes, and in such cases, the Company has no contractual basis for maintaining its relationships with the manufacturers and suppliers. Further, third parties may not comply with the terms of any agreements to which the Company is a party or may choose to terminate such agreements, allow such agreements to expire or seek to revise the agreements on terms which are less favorable to the Company than the prevailing terms, any of which could materially and adversely impact the Company\u2019s business and results.\nIn addition, while the Company sells its products to various users, including independent and franchise dry cleaning stores and chains, laundry plants, hotels, motels, cruise lines, hospitals, nursing homes, government institutions, coin laundry stores and distributors, sales to one customer accounted for approximately 12% of the Company\u2019s revenues for fiscal 2016. The Company\u2019s operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted if the Company loses such significant customer, fails to meet its customers\u2019 expectations or otherwise realizes a decrease in its sales.\nThe Company faces substantial competition.\nThe commercial and industrial laundry, dry cleaning equipment and boiler distribution business is highly competitive and fragmented, with over 100 full-line or partial-line equipment distributors in the United States. The Company\u2019s management believes that no one distributor has a major share of the market; substantially all distributors are independently owned; and, with the exception of several regional distributors, distributors operate primarily in local markets. In Florida, the Company\u2019s principal domestic market, the Company\u2019s primary competition is from a number of full line distributors and several manufacturers, which sell direct to the customer. In the export market, the Company competes with distributors and manufacturers. The Company also faces competition from several franchisors and turn-key suppliers of dry cleaning stores, primarily on the basis of trademark recognition and reputation, in connection with its licensing operations and its activities related to the design and planning of turn-key dry cleaning establishments for its customers. Certain of the Company\u2019s competitors have greater\nfinancial and other resources than the Company. In addition, some of the Company\u2019s competitors may have less indebtedness than the Company, and therefore more of their cash may be potentially available for business purposes other than debt service. The Company\u2019s results and financial condition would be materially and adversely impacted if the Company is unable to compete effectively. Further, the Company may not be able to operate profitably if the competitive environment changes.\nInability to protect the Company\u2019s service marks and other proprietary rights could adversely impact the Company\u2019s competitive position.\nThe Company is the owner of United States service mark registrations for the names EnviroStar\u00ae, Aero-Tech\u00ae, and Green Jet\u00ae, which are used in connection with the Company\u2019s laundry and dry cleaning equipment, and for the name DRYCLEAN USA\u00ae, which is licensed by the Company to retail dry cleaning establishments. While the Company intends to and has taken steps to protect its service marks and other proprietary rights, the Company may not be successful in doing so and third parties may infringe or misappropriate the Company\u2019s intellectual property and proprietary rights. Any infringement or misappropriation of the Company\u2019s intellectual property and proprietary rights could damage their value and could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results and financial condition. Further, the Company may have to engage in litigation to protect the rights to its intellectual property and proprietary rights, which could result in significant litigation expenses and require a significant amount of management's time.\nDamages to or disruptions at the Company\u2019s facilities could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s executive offices and the main distribution center for the products it distributes are housed in two leased adjacent facilities totaling approximately 38,000 square feet in Miami, Florida, which is an area subject to hurricane casualty and flood risk. Although the Company has certain limited protection afforded by insurance, the Company\u2019s business, earnings and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major windstorm or flooding.\nThe Company faces risks associated with environmental and other regulation.\nThe Company\u2019s business and operations are subject to federal, state, local and foreign environmental and other laws and regulations, including environmental laws governing the discharge of pollutants, the handling, generation, storage and disposal of hazardous materials, substances, and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites. The Company may not remain in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and could be required to incur significant costs as a result of violations of, liabilities under, or efforts to comply with, applicable laws and regulations. In addition, violations may have other adverse implications for the Company, including negative public relations and potential litigation. Further, the Company may incur significant compliance costs in the event of changes to the laws and regulations applicable to the Company.\nThe Company faces risks related to its foreign operations.\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, export revenues totaled approximately $4.6 million, which represented approximately 12.9% of the Company\u2019s total revenues for such fiscal year. These export revenues related principally to the Company\u2019s sales of commercial and industrial laundry and dry cleaning equipment and boilers activities to the Caribbean and Latin America. All of the Company\u2019s export sales require the customer to make payment in United States dollars. Foreign sales may be affected by the strength of the United States dollar relative to the currencies of the countries in which customers and competitors are located, as well as the strength of the economies of the countries in which the Company\u2019s customers are located.\nFurther, conducting an international business inherently involves a number of difficulties, risks and uncertainties, such as:\n\u00b7 export and trade restrictions,\n\u00b7 inconsistent and changing regulatory requirements,\n\u00b7 tariffs and other trade barriers,\n\u00b7 cultural issues,\n\u00b7 problems in collecting accounts receivable,\n\u00b7 political instability,\n\u00b7 local economic downturns, and\n\u00b7 potentially adverse tax consequences.\nAny of the above factors may materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, prospects, operating results or financial condition.\nHenry M. Nahmad may be deemed to control the Company.\nHenry M. Nahmad, the Company\u2019s Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, is the Manager and President of Symmetric Capital LLC (\u201cSymmetric\u201d) and may be deemed to control Symmetric. Symmetric owns 2,838,194 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, which represents approximately 40.4% of the total number of issued and outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. In addition, Symmetric and Mr. Nahmad are parties to a Stockholders Agreement with Michael S. Steiner, the Company\u2019s Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President, and Robert M. Steiner, Mr. Michael Steiner\u2019s brother. Pursuant to such Stockholders Agreement, each of Mr. Michael Steiner and Mr. Robert Steiner (who as of the date of filing of this Report hold 600,100 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock and 100,000 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, respectively) agreed to vote all shares of the Company\u2019s common stock owned by them at any time during the term of the Stockholders Agreement as directed by Mr. Nahmad, as the Manager of Symmetric, and have granted to Mr. Nahmad, as the Manager of Symmetric, an irrevocable proxy and power of attorney in furtherance thereof. The Stockholders Agreement also contains, among other things, (i) a right of first refusal held by Symmetric with respect to proposed sales of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock by Mr. Michael Steiner or Mr. Robert Steiner and (ii) a special call right which, in the event of Mr. Michael Steiner\u2019s death or Disability (as defined in the Stockholders Agreement) during the term of the Stockholders Agreements, would entitle Symmetric (or its assignee) to purchase all of the shares of the Company\u2019s common stock held by Mr. Michael Steiner and Mr. Robert Steiner at the then-prevailing fair market value. The Stockholders Agreement will expire in March 2020, unless earlier terminated at Symmetric\u2019s election or under certain other limited circumstances.\nIncluding the shares of the Company\u2019s common stock owned by Symmetric and the shares of the Company\u2019s common stock over which Mr. Nahmad, as the Manager of Symmetric, may be deemed to have voting power as a result of the Stockholders Agreement described above, Mr. Nahmad, as the Manager of Symmetric, may be deemed to have voting power over a total of approximately 50.3% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. Under the Company\u2019s Bylaws, except with respect to the election of directors (which requires a plurality vote), with respect to any matter put to a vote of the Company\u2019s stockholders, the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of the Company\u2019s common stock represented at a meeting, in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote on the matter is required to approve the matter, unless a greater percentage is required by applicable law. Consequently, Mr. Nahmad, as the Manager of Symmetric, without the consent of any other stockholders of the Company, can approve actions that require stockholder approval and elect directors acceptable to him. Mr. Nahmad\u2019s interests may conflict with the interests of the Company\u2019s other stockholders.\nSee also the risk factor captioned \u201cThe proposed acquisition of Western State Design may not be completed on a timely basis, on anticipated terms, or at all, and there are uncertainties and risks relating\nto the transaction\u201d above for information regarding the increased voting power that Mr. Nahmad is expected have with respect to the Company if the Western State Design Acquisition and Private Placement are consummated.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends on key personnel, the loss of whom could harm the Company\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s business is dependent on the active participation of its executive officers, including, without limitation Henry M. Nahmad and Michael S. Steiner. The loss of the services of any of these individuals could adversely affect the Company business and future prospects. In addition, the Company\u2019s success is dependent on its ability to retain and attract additional qualified management and other personnel. Competition for such talent is intense, and the Company may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel.\nThe Company\u2019s common stock has a limited trading volume, and the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock may be volatile.\nThe Company\u2019s common stock is listed and traded on the NYSE MKT. Because, as described above, Symmetric owns approximately 40.4% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s common stock and has a right of first refusal over an additional approximately 9.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, the Company has a limited non-affiliate market capitalization. As a result, the Company\u2019s common stock has a limited trading volume, which may make it more difficult for stockholders to sell their shares, and which may make the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock subject to price volatility.\nThe issuance of preferred stock and common stock, and the Company\u2019s Board of Directors authority to approve issuances of preferred stock and common stock, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s stockholders and have an anti-takeover effect.\nThe Company\u2019s Board of Directors is authorized under the Company\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the \u201cCertificate of Incorporation\u201d), to approve the issuance by the Company of up to 200,000 shares of preferred stock, and to designate the relative rights, preferences and limitations of any preferred stock so issued, in each case, without any further action on the part of the Company\u2019s stockholders. Currently, no shares of preferred stock are outstanding. In the event that the Company issues preferred stock in the future that has preference over the Company\u2019s common stock with respect to payment of dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the rights of holders of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock may be adversely affected. In addition, the Company is authorized under its Certificate of Incorporation to issue 15,000,000 shares of common stock, and currently has 7,033,732 shares outstanding. Subject to applicable law and the rules and regulations of the NYSE MKT, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors (or a committee thereof, in the case of shares issued under the Company\u2019s 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (the \u201cPlan\u201d)) has the power to approve the issuance of any authorized but unissued shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, and any such issuances, including, without limitation, those under the Plan or pursuant to any acquisitions consummated by the Company or in connection with the financing thereof, would result in dilution to the Company\u2019s stockholders. As previously described, the Company expects to issue a total of 3,335,313 shares of its Common Stock in connection with the Western State Design Acquisition and the Private Placement. Based on the number of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock currently outstanding, the issuance of shares in connection with the Western State Design Acquisition and the Private Placement would result in an approximately 47% increase in the total number of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock immediately and therefore would result in substantial dilution to the Company\u2019s stockholders.\nThe above-described provisions of the Company\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation, as well as Mr. Nahmad\u2019s control position with respect to the Company, could also delay, defer or prevent a change of\ncontrol of the Company or its management, and could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nLitigation and legal proceedings and the impact of any finding of liability or damages could adversely impact the Company and its financial condition and operating results.\nThe Company may from time to time become subject to litigation and other legal proceedings relating to its business and operations. Litigation and other legal proceedings may require the Company to incur significant expenses, including those relating to legal and other professional fees. In addition, litigation and other legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse outcomes in litigation or other legal proceedings could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition, cash flows, and operating results.\nThere are inherent uncertainties involved in estimates, judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Any changes in estimates, judgments and assumptions used could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position and operating results.\nThe consolidated financial statements included in the periodic reports the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including those included as part of this Report, are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP involves making estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets (including goodwill and other intangible assets), liabilities and related reserves, revenues, expenses and income. This includes estimates, judgments and assumptions for assessing the recoverability of intangible assets pursuant to applicable accounting guidance. If any estimates, judgments or assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record additional expenses or impairment charges, which would be recorded as a charge against earnings, and any such changes could result in corresponding changes to the amounts of assets (including goodwill and other intangible assets), liabilities, revenues, expenses and income, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial position and operating results.", "PERMNO": 87437, "SIC": 5080, "TIC": "EVI"}
