{"cik": "785956", "company": "J&J SNACK FOODS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-11-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all the other information included in this report, in considering our business and prospects. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem insignificant may also impair our business operations. Following is a discussion of known potentially significant risks which could result in harm to our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to COVID-19\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 continues to affect our operations. Approximately 2/3 of our sales are to venues and locations that have shut down or sharply curtailed their foodservice operations over the past nine months so we anticipate COVID-19 will continue to have a negative impact on our business as the uncertainty surrounding the future of the pandemic and varying state and local laws on public gatherings, shelter in place ordinances and virtual schooling at all levels continues. The impact of the pandemic on our operations to date is discussed in Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion And Analysis Of Financial Condition And Results Of Operations of this Form 10-K. The extent of the future impact of COVID-19 on our operations depends on future developments of the virus and its effects which is uncertain at this point in time.\nRisks of Shortages or Increased Cost of Raw Materials\nWe are exposed to the market risks arising from adverse changes in commodity prices, affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy. The raw materials and energy which we use for the production and distribution of our products are largely commodities that are subject to price volatility and fluctuations in availability caused by changes in global supply and demand, weather conditions, agricultural uncertainty or governmental controls. We purchase these materials and energy mainly in the open market. Our procurement practices are intended to reduce the risk of future price increases, but also may potentially limit the ability to benefit from possible price decreases. If commodity price changes result in increases in raw materials and energy costs, we may not be able to increase our prices to offset these increased costs without suffering reduced volume, revenue and operating income.\nGeneral Risks of the Food Industry\nFood processors are subject to the risks of adverse changes in general economic conditions; evolving consumer preferences and nutritional and health-related concerns; changes in food distribution channels; federal, state and local food processing controls or other mandates; changes in federal, state, local and international laws and regulations, or in the application of such laws and regulations; consumer product liability claims; risks of product tampering and contamination; and negative publicity surrounding actual or perceived product safety deficiencies. The increased buying power of large supermarket chains, other retail outlets and wholesale food vendors could result in greater resistance to price increases and could alter the pattern of customer inventory levels and access to shelf space.\nRisks of Shortages or Increased Costs of Labor\nOur businesses operate in highly competitive markets. The labor market in the United States is very competitive and the unemployment rate is at historic lows. We depend on the skills, working relationships, and continued services of key personnel, including our experienced management team. We must hire, train and develop effective employees. We compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel, and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract, train, and retain other talented personnel. In addition, our ability to achieve our operating goals depends on our ability to identify, hire, train, and retain qualified individuals. Any such loss or failure could adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results.\nEnvironmental Risks\nThe disposal of solid and liquid waste material resulting from the preparation and processing of foods is subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Such laws and regulations have an important effect on the food processing industry as a whole, requiring substantially all firms in the industry to incur material expenditures for modification of existing processing facilities and for construction of upgraded or new waste treatment facilities.\nWe cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future, how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted or what environmental conditions may be found to exist. Enactment of more stringent laws or regulations or more strict interpretation of existing laws and regulations may require additional expenditures by us, some of which could be material.\nRisks Resulting from Customer Concentration\nWe have several large customers that account for a significant portion of our sales. Our top ten customers accounted for 43%, 43% and 43% of our sales during fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, with our largest customer accounting for 13% of our sales in 2020, 11% of our sales in 2019 and 9-1/2% of our sales in 2018.\nThree of the ten customers in 2020 are food distributors who sell our product to many end users. The loss of one or more of our large customers could adversely affect our results of operations. These customers typically do not enter into long-term contracts and make purchase decisions based on a combination of price, product quality, consumer demand and customer service performance. If our sales to one or more of these customers are reduced, this reduction may adversely affect our business. If receivables from one or more of these customers become uncollectible, our operating income would be adversely impacted.\nCompetition\nOur businesses operate in highly competitive markets. We compete against national and regional manufacturers and distributors on the basis of price, quality, product variety and effective distribution. Many of our major competitors in the market are larger and have greater financial and marketing resources than we do. Increased competition and anticipated actions by our competitors could lead to downward pressure on prices and/or a decline in our market share, either of which could adversely affect our results. See \u201cCompetition\u201d in Item 1 for more information about our competitors.\nRisks Relating to Manufacturing and Distribution\nOur ability to purchase, manufacture and distribute products is critical to our success. Because we source certain products from single manufacturing sites, it is possible that we could experience a production disruption that results in a reduction or elimination of the availability of some of our products. If we are not able to obtain alternate production capability in a timely manner, or on favorable terms, it could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, including the potential for long-term loss of product placement with various customers. We are also subject to risks of other business disruptions associated with our dependence on production facilities and distribution systems. Natural disasters, terrorist activity, cyberattacks or other unforeseen events could interrupt production or distribution and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, including the potential for long-term loss of product placement with our customers.\nRisks Relating to the Availability and Costs of Transportation\nOur ability to obtain adequate and reasonably priced methods of transportation to distribute our products, including refrigerated trailers for many of our products, is a key factor to our success. Delays in transportation, including weather-related delays, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Further, higher fuel costs and increased line haul costs due to industry capacity constraints, customer delivery requirements and a more restrictive regulatory environment could also negatively impact our financial results. We pay fuel surcharges that fluctuate with the price of diesel fuel to third-party transporters of our products, and such surcharges can be substantial. Any sudden or dramatic increases in the price of diesel fuel would serve to increase our fuel surcharges and our cost of goods sold. If we were unable to pass higher freight costs to our customers in the form of price increases, those higher costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nRisks Relating to Manufacturing Capacity Constraints\nOur current manufacturing resources may be inadequate to meet significantly increased demand for some of our food products. Our ability to increase our manufacturing capacity depends on many factors, including the equipment delivery, construction lead-times, installation, qualification, regulatory permitting and regulatory requirements. A lack of sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand could cause our customer service levels to decrease, which may negatively affect customer demand for our products and customer relations generally, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, operating facilities at or near capacity may also increase production and distribution costs and negatively affect relations with our employees or contractors, which could result in disruptions in our operations.\nNew Jersey Law and Provisions of Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws May Inhibit a Change In Control\nThe New Jersey Shareholders' Protection Act, N.J.S.A. 14A:10A-1, et seq., may delay, deter or prevent a change in control by prohibiting the Company from engaging in a business combination transaction with an interested shareholder for a period of five years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a majority of our shareholders believe a change in control would be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. In addition, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws contain provisions that may delay, deter or prevent a future acquisition of J & J Snack Foods Corp. not approved by our Board of Directors. This could occur even if our shareholders are offered an attractive value for their shares or if a substantial number or even a majority of our shareholders believe the takeover is in their best interest. These provisions are intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring us to negotiate with and obtain the approval of our Board of Directors in connection with the transaction. Provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws that could delay, deter or prevent a future acquisition include the following:\n--\na classified Board of Directors;\n--\nthe requirement that our shareholders may only remove Directors for cause;\n--\nlimitations on share holdings and voting of certain persons;\n--\nspecial Director voting rights;\n--\nthe ability of the Board of Directors to consider the interests of various constituencies, including our employees, customers, suppliers, creditors and the local communities in which we operate;\n--\nshareholders do not generally have the right to call special meetings or to act by written consent;\n--\nour Bylaws contain advance notice procedures for nominations of Directors or submission of shareholder proposals at an annual meeting; and\n--\nour Bylaws contain a forum selection clause providing that certain litigation against the Company can only be brought in New Jersey state or federal courts.\nRisks Relating to Gerald B. Shreiber\nGerald B. Shreiber is the founder and Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company and the current beneficial owner of 19% of its outstanding common stock. Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that Mr. Shreiber has three votes on any matter to be acted upon by the Board of Directors (subject to certain adjustments). Therefore, he and one other director would have the ability to approve any matter before the Board. The performance of the Company is greatly impacted by his leadership and decisions.\nRisk Related to Increases in our Health Insurance Costs\nThe costs of employee health care insurance have been increasing in recent years due to rising health care costs, legislative changes, and general economic conditions. Because of the breadth and complexity of health care regulations as well as other health care reform legislation considered by Congress and state legislatures, we cannot predict with certainty the future effect of these laws on us. A continued increase in health care costs or additional costs incurred as a result of new or existing health care reform laws or changes in enforcement policies could have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nRisk Related to Product Changes\nThere are risks in the marketplace related to trade and consumer acceptance of product improvements, packing initiatives and new product introductions.\nRisks Related to Changes in the Business\nOur ability to successfully manage changes to our business processes, including selling, distribution, product capacity, information management systems and the integration of acquisitions, will directly affect our results of operations.\nRisks Associated with Foreign Operations\nForeign operations generally involve greater risk than doing business in the United States. Foreign economies differ favorably or unfavorably from the United States\u2019 economy in such respects as the level of inflation and debt, which may result in fluctuations in the value of the country\u2019s currency and real property. Further, there may be less government regulation in various countries, and difficulty in enforcing legal rights outside the United States. Additionally, in some foreign countries, there is the possibility of expropriation or confiscatory taxation limitations on the removal of property or other assets, political or social instability or diplomatic developments which could affect the operations and assets of U.S. companies doing business in that country. Sales of our foreign operations were $15,421,000, $33,906,000 and $32,459,000 in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. At September 26, 2020, the total assets of our foreign operations were approximately $20 million or 1.9% of total assets. At September 28, 2019, the total assets of our foreign operations were approximately $26 million or 2.6% of total assets.\nRisks Associated with our Information Technology Systems\nThe efficient operation of our business depends on our information technology systems. We rely on our information technology systems to effectively manage our business data, communications, supply chain, manufacturing, order entry and fulfillment, and other business processes. The failure of our information technology systems (including those provided to us by third parties) to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in billing, collecting, and ordering errors, processing inefficiencies, and the loss of sales and customers, causing our business and results of operations to suffer.\nOur information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control, including fire, natural disasters, systems failures, security breaches or intrusions (including theft of customer, consumer or other confidential data), and viruses. If we are unable to prevent physical and electronic break-ins, cyber-attacks and other information security breaches, we may suffer financial and reputational damage, be subject to litigation or incur remediation costs or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our partners, customers, suppliers or employees.\nWe may experience difficulties in implementing the final phases of our new enterprise resource planning system. We are in the late stages of a multi-year implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system (\u201cERP\u201d), which is replacing our existing financial and operating systems. The design and implementation of this new ERP has required an investment of significant personnel and financial resources, including substantial expenditures for outside consultants and software. We may not be able to implement the ERP successfully without experiencing delays, increased costs and other difficulties, including potential design defects, miscalculations, testing requirements, and the diversion of management\u2019s attention from day-to-day business operations. If we are unable to implement the new ERP as planned, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected, our ability to assess those controls adequately could be delayed, and our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be negatively impacted.\nRisks Associated with Real or Perceived Safety Issues Regarding our Food Products\nWe sell food products for human consumption, which involves risks such as product contamination or spoilage, product tampering, other adulteration of food products, mislabeling, and misbranding. We can be impacted by both real and unfounded claims regarding the safety of our operations, or concerns regarding mislabeled, adulterated, contaminated or spoiled food products. Any of these circumstances could necessitate a voluntary or mandatory recall due to a substantial product hazard, a need to change a product\u2019s labeling or other consumer safety concerns. A pervasive product recall may result in significant loss due to the costs of a recall, related legal claims, including claims arising from bodily injury or illness caused by our products, the destruction of product inventory, or lost sales due to product unavailability. A highly publicized product recall, whether involving us or any related products made by third parties, also could result in a loss of customers or an unfavorable change in consumer sentiment regarding our products or any category in which we operate. In addition, an allegation of noncompliance with federal or state food laws and regulations could force us to cease production, stop selling our products or create significant adverse publicity that could harm our credibility and decrease market acceptance of our products. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nSeasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations\nOur sales are affected by the seasonal demand for our products. Demand is greater during the summer months primarily as a result of the warm weather demand for our ICEE and frozen juice treats and desserts products. Because of seasonal fluctuations, there can be no assurance that the results of any particular quarter will be indicative of results for the full year or for future years.", "PERMNO": 10026, "SIC": 2050, "TIC": "JJSF"}
