{"cik": "1592057", "company": "Enviva Partners, LP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-08", "item_1A": "Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\" for information regarding certain risks inherent in our business.\nOverview\nWe are the world's largest supplier by production capacity of utility-grade wood pellets to major power generators. Since our entry into this business in 2010, we have executed multiple long-term, take-or-pay off-take contracts with utilities and large scale power generators and have built and acquired the production and terminaling capacity necessary to serve them. Our existing production constitutes approximately 14% of current global utility-grade wood pellet production capacity. We own and operate six industrial-scale production plants in the Southeastern U.S. that have a combined wood pellet production capacity of 2.3 million metric tons per year (\"MTPY\"). Three of our production plants are new facilities that we constructed using our templated design and standardized equipment. A fourth plant, our largest in terms of production capacity, has been in operation since 2008. We also own a dry-bulk, deep-water marine terminal at the Port of Chesapeake (the \"Chesapeake terminal\") that reduces our storage and shiploading costs and enables us to reliably supply our customers. All of our facilities are located in geographic regions with low input costs and favorable transportation logistics. Owning these cost-advantaged, fully-contracted assets in a rapidly expanding industry provides us with a platform to generate stable and growing cash flows that should enable us to increase our per-unit cash distributions over time, which is our primary business objective.\nWe were formed on November 12, 2013 as a wholly owned subsidiary of our sponsor. On April 9, 2015, our sponsor contributed some but not all of our Predecessor's assets and liabilities to us. On May 4, 2015, we completed an initial public offering (the \"IPO\") of common units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership. Our assets and operations are organized into a single reportable segment and are all located and conducted in the United States. Please read Part II, Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 1, Business and Basis of Presentation\" for further discussion regarding our formation and organization.\nIndustry Overview\nOur principal product, utility-grade wood pellets, is becoming a global energy commodity. Utility-grade wood pellets are used as a substitute for coal in both dedicated and co-fired power generation and combined heat and power plants. They enable major power generators to profitably generate electricity in a manner that reduces the overall cost of compliance with mandatory GHG emissions limits and\nrenewable energy targets while also allowing countries to diversify their sources of electricity supply. Unlike wind and solar power generation, wood pellet-fired plants are capable of meeting baseload electricity demand and are dispatchable (that is, power output can be switched on or off or adjusted based on demand). The capital costs required to convert a coal plant to co-fire biomass, or to burn biomass exclusively, are a fraction of the capital costs associated with implementing offshore wind and most other renewable technologies. Furthermore, the relatively quick process of converting coal-fired plants to biomass-fired generation is an attractive benefit for power generators whose generation assets are no longer viable as coal plants due to the expiration of operating permits or the introduction of taxes or other restrictions on fossil fuel usage or emissions of GHGs and other pollutants.\nThere also continues to be significant growth in the demand for wood pellets to heat homes and commercial buildings and to produce process heat at industrial sites. As the markets develop and commoditize, there will continue to be opportunities for utility-grade wood pellet producers to serve this growing demand.\nOur Assets and Operations\nWe procure wood fiber and process it into utility-grade wood pellets. We load the finished wood pellets into railcars, trucks and barges that are transported to deep-water marine terminals, where they are received, stored and ultimately loaded onto oceangoing vessels for transport to our principally Northern European customers.\nOur customers use our wood pellets as a substitute fuel for coal in dedicated biomass or co-fired coal power plants. Wood pellets serve as a suitable \"drop-in\" alternative to coal because of their comparable heat content, density and form. Due to the uninterruptible nature of our customers' fuel consumption, our customers require a reliable supply of wood pellets that meet stringent product specifications. We have built our operations and assets to deliver and certify the highest levels of product quality, and our proven track record enables us to charge premium prices for this certainty. In addition to our customers' focus on the reliability of supply, they are concerned about the combustion efficiency of the wood pellets and their safe handling. Because combustion efficiency is a function of energy density, particle size distribution, ash/inert content and moisture, our customers require that we supply wood pellets meeting minimum criteria for a variety of specifications and, in some cases, provide incentives for exceeding our contract specifications.\nOur Production Plants\nWe own and operate six industrial-scale wood pellet production plants located in the Mid-Atlantic and the Gulf Coast regions of the United States. These facilities are designed to run 24 hours per day, 365 days per year, although we schedule up to 15 days of maintenance for our plants during each calendar year. There are no regularly required major turnarounds or overhauls.\nMid-Atlantic Region Plants\nThe following table describes our three wood pellet production plants in the Mid-Atlantic region:\nAhoskie\nWe acquired the site of the Ahoskie plant in December 2010 and constructed a dedicated wood pellet production plant in less than one year, commencing operations in November 2011. Through an expansion completed in June 2012, we increased the plant's production from 260,000 MTPY to 350,000 MTPY and have made further improvements to increase production to its current capacity of 370,000 MTPY.\nProduction from the Ahoskie plant is transported by truck to our Chesapeake terminal.\nNorthampton\nThe Northampton plant was constructed based on the Ahoskie plant design, utilizing the same major equipment suppliers. The Northampton plant currently produces 510,000 MTPY of wood pellets.\nProduction from the Northampton plant is transported by truck to our Chesapeake terminal.\nSouthampton\nThe Southampton plant is a replica of our Northampton plant. The Southampton plant currently produces 510,000 MTPY of wood pellets. We acquired the Southampton plant from our sponsor in December 2015.\nProduction from the Southampton plant is transported by truck to our Chesapeake terminal.\nGulf Coast Region Plants\nThe following table describes our three wood pellet production plants in the Gulf Coast region:\nCottondale\nOur sponsor acquired Green Circle Bio Energy, Inc., which owns a wood pellet production plant in Cottondale, Florida, in January 2015, changed the name of this entity to Cottondale and contributed Cottondale to us in April 2015. The Cottondale plant was commissioned in 2008 and has undergone expansion and process improvements since then. The Cottondale plant currently produces 700,000 MTPY.\nProduction from the Cottondale plant is transported approximately 50 miles by short-line rail to a warehouse in Port Panama City, Florida, where we store up to 32,000 MT of inventory.\nAmory\nWe purchased the Amory plant in August 2010. The plant initially consisted of three pellet mills producing at a rate of 41,500 MTPY. Through basic operational improvements and installation of a fourth pellet mill, the Amory plant currently produces 110,000 MTPY.\nProduction from the Amory plant is transported by barge to a third-party deep-water marine terminal in Mobile, Alabama (the \"Mobile terminal\").\nWiggins\nWe purchased a 50% controlling interest in the entity that owns the Wiggins plant in October 2010, and subsequently contributed capital in exchange for additional interests that increased our ownership interest to a 67% controlling interest. During 2011, we completed a series of modifications to the plant and production capacity was increased from 45,000 MTPY to its current production capacity of 110,000 MTPY.\nProduction from the Wiggins plant is transported by truck to the Mobile terminal.\nLogistics and Storage Capabilities\nTo-Port Logistics and Port Infrastructure\nWe site our production plants to minimize wood fiber procurement and logistics costs. Our production plants are strategically located in advantaged fiber baskets and near multiple truck, rail, river and ocean transportation access points. We also have inland waterway access and rail access at our Chesapeake terminal and in Port Panama City. Our multi-year fixed-cost contracts with third-party logistics providers allow for long-term visibility into our to-port logistics cost structure.\nThe wood pellets produced at our plants must be stored, terminaled and shipped to our European customers. Limited deep-water, bulk terminaling assets exist in the Southeastern U.S., and very few of them have the appropriate handling and storage infrastructure necessary for receiving, storing and loading wood pellets. In response to such scarcity, we have vertically integrated our Mid-Atlantic operations downstream to encompass finished product logistics and storage. As a largely fixed cost and capital intensive piece of the value chain, our port infrastructure allows us to ship incremental product from our regional plants at a small fraction of the cost of our competitors. Management of port terminal infrastructure is also a key element in reducing distribution-related costs as we can manage the arrival and loading of vessels. Additionally, we are able to improve our cost position by maintaining a dedicated berth where pellets from our Mid-Atlantic region plants have priority and equipment with sufficient load rate capabilities to turn around vessels within the allotted time windows.\nIn addition to terminaling wood pellets from our production plants, we will, on occasion, provide terminaling services for third-party wood pellet producers as well as for owners of other bulk commodities.\nPort Operation in the Mid-Atlantic Region\nWe acquired a deep-water marine terminal located at the Port of Chesapeake in January 2011 and converted it into a major dry-bulk terminal. Wood pellets produced at our Mid-Atlantic region plants are transported by truck to our Chesapeake terminal. The Chesapeake terminal receives, stores and loads wood pellets for export and serves as the shipment point for products produced at our Mid-Atlantic region plants. The Chesapeake terminal accommodates Handysize, Supramax and Panamax-sized vessels, and has a 200-car rail yard adjacent to a Norfolk Southern track, a loading/unloading system to accommodate deliveries by truck, rail and barge and a highly automated conveying system. In May 2011, we erected a 157-foot tall, 175-foot wide storage dome that receives, stores and loads up to 45,000 MT of wood pellets. In April 2013, we placed into operation a second storage dome at the site to add an additional 45,000 MT of storage.\nThe Chesapeake terminal's storage and loading capacity is more than adequate to store and facilitate the loading of the wood pellets produced from our Mid-Atlantic region plants, and its location decreases our customers' transportation time and costs. Efficiently positioned near our Ahoskie,\nNorthampton and Southampton plants, the Chesapeake terminal delivers up to a three- to four-day European shipping advantage compared to other Southern or Gulf Coast ports. In addition, because we own the Chesapeake terminal, we enjoy preferential berth access and lading, which minimizes costs of shipping and logistics without the need for excess storage. Our ownership and operation of this terminal enables us to control shipment of the production of our Mid-Atlantic region plants.\nPort Operation in the Gulf Coast Region\nWood pellets from our Cottondale plant are transported via short-line rail to the Panama City terminal where we store up to 32,000 MT of inventory in a warehouse at Port Panama City. Production from the Cottondale plant is received, stored and loaded under a long-term warehouse service agreement with the Port Authority and a stevedoring contract, each of which runs through June 2018. We have the right to extend the warehouse services agreement for up to five additional two-year terms.\nWood pellets produced at our Amory and Wiggins plants are transported by barge and truck, respectively, to the Mobile terminal, where, pursuant to a long-term throughput agreement with Cooper Marine & Timberlands, we export from Cooper's ChipCo terminal. This privately owned and maintained deep-water, multi-berth terminal operates 24 hours per day, seven days per week and is the fleeting and loading point for production from our Amory and Wiggins plants. These production plants have been sited along major inland waterways and highways that make transportation to the Mobile terminal easy and efficient, thereby reducing emissions and costs. Trucked volumes from the Wiggins plant are transferred into barges and are fleeted along with barges from the Amory plant. The ability to store our wood pellets in barges provides a capital-light, flexible solution that accommodates the storage needs of the Amory and Wiggins plants.\nOur Sponsor's Assets and Development Projects\nIn connection with the closing of the IPO, we entered into a Purchase Rights Agreement with our sponsor, pursuant to which our sponsor granted us a five-year right of first offer to acquire the Wilmington Projects (as defined below) and any other wood pellet production plants and associated deep-water marine terminals that it or the Hancock JV may develop or acquire and elect to sell. We expect to pursue the acquisition of such assets to the extent that they are supported by long-term off-take contracts with creditworthy counterparties and have long useful lives, stable cost positions and advantaged locations.\nLong-Term, Take-or-Pay Off-Take Contracts\nThe Hancock JV is party to a ten-year take-or-pay off-take contract with DONG Energy Thermal Power A/S, a Danish power generator (\"DONG Energy\"). This contract commences September 1, 2016 and provides for sales of 360,000 MTPY for the first delivery year and 420,000 MTPY for years two through ten. DONG Energy's obligations under the contract are guaranteed by DONG Energy A/S.\nIn the first quarter of 2016, the Hancock JV entered into a new take-or-pay contract (the \"MGT Contract\") to be the sole source supplier of nearly 1 million tons of imported wood pellets needed annually by MGT Power's Teesside Renewable Energy Plant (the \"Tees REP\"), which is currently under development. Deliveries under the MGT Contract are expected to commence in 2019 and continue through 2034. Following the execution of the MGT Contract, we entered into a contract with the Hancock JV (the \"EVA-MGT Contract\") to supply 375,000 MTPY of the contracted volume to the Tees REP. For more information on the EVA-MGT Contract, please read \"-Customers-EVA-MGT Contract\" below. Both the EVA-MGT Contract and the MGT Contract are contingent upon the Tees REP reaching financial close.\nWilmington Projects\nThe Hancock JV continues to progress the construction of the 515,000 MTPY Sampson production plant and began commissioning the plant during 2016. In addition, the Hancock JV is constructing a deep-water marine terminal in Wilmington, North Carolina. We collectively refer to the Sampson plant, the Wilmington terminal and two future production plants as the \"Wilmington Projects.\" The production plants under development are strategically sited in attractive fiber baskets in close proximity to the Wilmington terminal.\nAlthough we expect to continue to have the opportunity to acquire assets, including the Wilmington Projects, from our sponsor or the Hancock JV in the future, there can be no assurance that our sponsor or the Hancock JV will be successful in completing their development projects or that our sponsor will decide to sell, or compel the Hancock JV to sell, assets or completed development projects to us.\nCustomers\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we generated substantially all of our revenues from sales under long-term off-take contracts. We seek to contract a substantial portion of our production through long-term off-take contracts supplemented by smaller contracts of intermediate or short duration to take advantage of opportunities in the market.\nDepending on the specific take-or-pay off-take contract, shipping terms are either \"Cost, Insurance and Freight\" (\"CIF\") or \"Free On Board\" (\"FOB\"). Under a CIF contract, we procure and pay for shipping costs, which include insurance and all other charges, up to the port of destination for the customer. These costs are included in the price to the customer and, as such, are included in revenue and cost of goods sold. Under an FOB contract, the customer is directly responsible for shipping costs. We have entered into fixed-price shipping contracts with reputable shippers matching the terms and volumes of our contracts for which we are responsible for arranging shipping.\nWe have take-or-pay off-take contracts with utilities and large European power generators such as Drax and ENGIE (formerly known as GDF SUEZ Energy Management Trading). Excluding the EVA-MGT Contract and the Langerlo contract, described below, our off-take contracts provide for sales of 2.3 million MT of wood pellets in 2016 and have a weighted average remaining term of 7.1 years from March 1, 2016. As our current off-take contracts expire, we will seek to recontract our capacity with a combination of renewals with existing customers, the acquisition of additional contracts from the Hancock JV and the entry into contracts with new customers.\nDrax Contracts. We began selling utility-grade wood pellets pursuant to a contract with Drax (the \"First Drax Contract\") in the amount of 468,750 MTPY on April 1, 2013. Beginning on April 1, 2014 through the end of the term of the First Drax Contract in 2022, we will sell 1,000,000 MTPY of wood pellets. In connection with the Southampton Drop-Down, the Hancock JV assigned to us a ten-year contract with Drax (the \"Second Drax Contract\"). The Second Drax Contract commenced on December 1, 2015, and we will supply 385,000 MT for the first delivery year and 500,000 MTPY for years two through ten.\nENGIE. We began selling utility-grade wood pellets to Electrabel in the amount of 480,000 MTPY on June 30, 2011. The initial contract term expires in June 2017.\nLangerlo Contract. We have contracted with the owner of the Langerlo power station in Ghent, Belgium, to supply 450,000 MTPY of wood pellets beginning in 2017 and continuing through 2026. The owner intends to convert the plant from coal to biomass. In the first quarter of 2016, an affiliate of the owner filed for insolvency. Although we do not believe that our customer is involved in the insolvency proceeding, it is possible that our customer will not be able to perform under the terms of the contract.\nEVA-MGT Contract. We have contracted with the Hancock JV to supply 375,000 MTPY to the Tees REP. The EVA-MGT Contract is denominated in British Pound Sterling and commences in 2019, ramps to full supply in 2021 and continues through 2034. The contract is contingent upon Tees REP reaching financial close. For more information on the EVA-MGT Contract, please read Part III, Item 13. \"Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence-Agreements with Affiliates-EVA-MGT Contract.\"\nWe refer to the structure of our contracts as \"take-or-pay\" because they include a firm obligation to take a fixed quantity of product at a stated price and provisions that compensate us in the case of our customer's failure to accept all or a part of the contracted volumes or for termination by our customer. Our contracts provide for annual inflation-based adjustments or price escalators. Certain of our contracts also contain provisions that allow us to increase or decrease the volume of product that we deliver by a percentage of the base volume of the contract, as well as cost pass-through provisions related to stumpage (i.e., the price paid to the underlying timber resource owner for the raw material), fuel or transportation costs and price adjustments for actual product specifications. In addition, certain of our contracts and related arrangements provide for certain cost recovery and sharing arrangements in connection with certain changes in law or sustainability requirements and for payments to us in the case of termination as a result of such changes.\nIn addition to our long-term contracts, we also sell product under limited scope contracts. On occasion, we will intermediate dislocations in the market by entering into back-to-back transactions with physical delivery. We also provide terminaling services for other bulk commodities and fiber procurement services for domestic users of wood fiber.\nContracted Backlog\nAs of March 1, 2016, we had approximately $2.3 billion of product sales backlog for firm contracted product sales to Drax, ENGIE and other major power generators. Backlog represents the revenue to be recognized under existing contracts assuming deliveries occur as specified in the contract.\nExcluding the EVA-MGT Contract and the Langerlo contract, our expected future product sales revenue under our contracted backlog as of March 1, 2016 is as follows (in millions):\nWood Fiber Procurement\nAlthough stumpage (i.e., the price paid to the underlying timber resource owner for the raw material) constitutes only approximately 15% of our total cost of delivered products, wood fiber procurement is a vital function of our business, and cost-effective access to wood fiber is an important factor in our pricing stability. Our raw materials are byproducts of traditional timber harvesting, principally the tops and limbs of trees as well as other low-value wood materials that are generated in a harvest. We procure wood fiber directly from timber owners, loggers and other suppliers. We also opportunistically acquire industrial residuals (sawdust and shavings) and forest residuals (woodchips and slash) when they provide a cost advantage. Due to the moisture content of unprocessed wood, it cannot be transported economically over long distances. Therefore, the specific regional wood fiber resource supply and demand balance dictates the underlying economics of wood fiber procurement. For this reason, we have elected to site our facilities in some of the most robust and advantaged fiber baskets in the world.\nOur customers are subject to stringent requirements regarding the sustainability of the fuels they procure. In addition to our internal sustainability policies and initiatives, our wood fiber procurement is conducted in accordance with leading forest certification standards. Our wood pellet production plants and their associated fiber supply chains have been audited by independent third parties and certified to the Sustainable Forestry Initiative\u00ae (SFI\u00ae) fiber sourcing standard and have achieved chain-of-custody certifications to the Forest Stewardship Council\u2122 (FSC\u00ae) and the Programme for Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC). In addition, we proactively work with all of our suppliers to promote responsible forest management on all lands, not just those that are already certified.\nOur wood fiber demand is complementary to, rather than in competition with, demand for high-grade wood for use by most other forest-related industries, such as lumber and furniture making. Improvements in the U.S. housing construction industry increase the demand for construction-quality lumber, which in turn increases the available supply of the low-cost pulpwood and mill residues that are used in wood pellet production. By using commercial thinnings and byproducts as raw materials, wood pellet production also indirectly supports other forest-related industries as well as the sustainable management of commercial forests.\nThe wood fiber used for wood pellet production comprises predominantly pulpwood, which derives its name from its traditional use by the pulp and paper industry and includes roundwood (typically thinnings from forest management operations and the tops and branches from sawlogs), and wood residues (primarily mill residues, a byproduct of sawmilling and veneer mill operations). Our procured wood fiber consists of:\n\u2022 Low-grade wood fiber: wood that is unsuitable for or rejected by the sawmilling and lumber industries because of small size, defects (e.g. crooked or knotty), disease or pest infestation;\n\u2022 Tops and limbs: the parts of trees that cannot be processed into lumber;\n\u2022 Commercial thinnings: harvests that promote the growth of higher value timber by removing weaker or deformed trees to reduce competition for water, nutrients and sunlight; and\n\u2022 Mill residues: chips, sawdust and other wood industry byproducts.\nDemand for the non-merchantable trees, waste products or byproducts that we use is generally low because they have few competing uses, and such raw materials represent approximately 10% to 30% of the value paid to a landowner for any given harvest. The tops, limbs and other low-grade wood fiber we purchase would otherwise generally be left on the forest floor, impeding reforestation, or burned. Wood pellet production provides a profitable use for the residues from sawmill and furniture industries and for the trees that are thinned to make room for higher value lumber-grade timber. U.S. demand for such low grade wood fiber historically emerged from the pulp and paper industry. However, due to the decline in demand from paper and pulp, many landowners lack commercial markets for this wood fiber. Wood pellet producers help fill the gap.\nAs a result of the fragmented nature of tract ownership, we procure raw materials from hundreds of landowners, loggers and timber industry participants, with no individual landowner representing a material fraction of any of our production plants' needs. Our wood fiber is procured under a range of arrangements, including (1) the direct purchase of timber tracts which provide an inventory of stumpage, (2) logging contracts for the thinnings, pulpwood and other unmerchandised chip-and-saw timber cut by a harvester, (3) in-woods chipping contracts where we may also provide the actual harvesting assets, (4) contracts with timber dealers and (5) \"gatewood\" purchases, which refer to wood hauled to a mill that was not purchased as standing timber by the mill. We have sourced wood fiber from more than 500 suppliers, including landowners growing both hardwoods and softwoods and other suppliers. The diversity of our supply base enables us to maintain stable costs, and our facilities' advantaged siting ensures consistent and reliable deliveries at lower cost than others in our region or industry.\nCompetition\nWe compete with other utility-grade wood pellet producers for long-term, take-or-pay off-take contracts with major power generation customers. Competition in our industry is based on the price, quality and consistency of the wood pellets produced, the reliability of wood pellet deliveries and the producer's ability to verify and document, through customer and third-party audits, that its wood pellets meet the regulatory sustainability obligations of a particular customer.\nMost of the world's current wood pellet production plants are owned by small, private companies, with few companies owning or operating multiple plants. Few companies have the scale, technical expertise or commercial infrastructure necessary to supply utility-grade wood pellets under large, long-term off-take contracts with power generators. We are the largest producer by production capacity, and consider the limited number of other companies with comparable scale, technical expertise or commercial infrastructure to be our competitors.\nApproximately 58% of the world's utility-grade wood pellet production capacity is located in North America. Other current producers of utility-grade wood pellets in North America include Fram Renewable Fuels, LLC, which is owned by an individual investor, Georgia Biomass, LLC, a plant owned by RWE Innogy, Rentech Inc., Pacific BioEnergy, Pinnacle Renewable Energy Inc., Drax Biomass Inc., affiliates of German Pellets GmbH, The Navigator Company, S.A., Zilkha Biomass LLC and The Westervelt Company.\nOur Management and Employees\nWe are managed and operated by the board of directors and the executive officers of our General Partner. As a result of owning our General Partner, our sponsor has the right to appoint all members of the board of directors of our General Partner, at least three of whom must meet the independence standards established by the NYSE. Our unitholders are not entitled to elect our General Partner or its directors or otherwise directly participate in our management or operations. For more information about the executive officers and directors of our General Partner, please read Part III, Item 10. \"Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance.\"\nAs of December 31, 2015, Enviva Management had 569 employees. Please read Part II, Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Related Party Transactions\" for more information regarding our management services agreement with Enviva Management.\nOur Relationship with Our Sponsor\nOur sponsor, Enviva Holdings, LP, is a majority owned subsidiary of the Riverstone Funds.\nOur sponsor owns approximately 10.5% of our common units, all of our subordinated units and our General Partner. Our General Partner owns our incentive distribution rights, which entitles our General Partner to increasing percentages of our cash distribution above certain targets. As a result, our sponsor is incentivized to facilitate our access to accretive acquisition and organic growth opportunities, including those pursuant to the right of first offer it granted to us in connection with our IPO.\nOur sponsor is the managing member and operator of the Hancock JV and is responsible for managing the activities of the Hancock JV, including the development and construction of the Hancock JV's development projects.\nEnvironmental Matters\nOur operations are subject to stringent and comprehensive federal, state and local laws and regulations governing matters including environmental protection, occupational health and safety and\nthe release or discharge of materials into the environment, including air emissions and wastewater discharges. These laws and regulations may (i) require acquisition, compliance with and maintenance of certain permits or other approvals to conduct regulated activities, (ii) impose technology requirements or standards on our operations, (iii) restrict the amounts and types of substances that may be discharged or emitted into the environment, (iv) limit or prohibit construction or timbering activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands or areas inhabited by endangered or threatened species, (v) govern worker health and safety aspects of operations, (vi) require measures to investigate, mitigate or remediate releases of hazardous or other substances from our operations and (vii) impose substantial liabilities, including possible fines and penalties for unpermitted emissions or discharges from our operations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory and remedial obligations and the issuance of orders enjoining some or all of our operations in affected areas.\nMoreover, the trend in environmental regulation is towards increasingly stringent and broader requirements for activities that may affect the environment. Any changes in environmental laws and regulations or re-interpretation of enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position. Although we monitor environmental requirements closely and budget for the expected costs, actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate spending. Moreover, certain environmental laws impose joint and several, strict liability for costs to clean up and restore sites where pollutants have been disposed or otherwise spilled or released. We cannot assure you that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities for remediation or damage to property, natural resources or persons as a result of spills or releases from our operations or those of a third party. Although we believe that our competitors will face similar environmental requirements, other market factors may prevent us from passing on any increased costs to our customers. Although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not materially affect us, there is no assurance that the current level of regulation will continue in the future.\nThe following summarizes some of the more significant existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations applicable to our business operations and with which compliance may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations or financial position.\nAir Emissions\nThe Clean Air Act, as amended (\"CAA\"), and state and local laws and regulations that implement and add to CAA requirements, regulate the emission of air pollutants from our facilities. The CAA imposes significant monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements for these emissions. These laws and regulations require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permits, and in certain cases utilize specific equipment or technologies to control and measure emissions. Obtaining these permits can be both costly and time intensive and has the potential to delay the opening of new plants or the significant expansion of existing plants.\nThe CAA requires that we obtain various construction and operating permits, including, in some cases, Title V air permits. In certain cases, the CAA requires us to incur capital expenditures to install air pollution control devices at our facilities. We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, substantial administrative and capital expenditures to maintain compliance with CAA requirements that have been promulgated or may be promulgated or revised in the future.\nClimate Change and Greenhouse Gases\nIn response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and certain other gases, referred to as greenhouse gases (\"GHGs\"), present an endangerment to public health and the environment, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"U.S. EPA\") has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the CAA that require a reduction in emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles and certain stationary sources. In August 2015, U.S. EPA also issued its final rules to reduce GHG pollution from existing and new power plants (\"CPP\"). Although the CPP has been stayed by the United States Supreme Court while legal challenges are pending, U.S. EPA maintains that implementation of the rule will begin as scheduled in 2022, and states are currently evaluating if and how to continue with the development of their implementation plans. Although U.S. EPA permits states to consider biomass-based fuel in energy production in their plans as a mechanism to meet the emission reduction requirements of the CPP, there remains uncertainty regarding the treatment of biomass under the rule and costs to implement the rule. See Item 1A. \"Risk Factor-Climate change legislation, regulatory initiatives and litigation could result in increased operating costs.\" and \"Risk Factor-Changes in government policies, incentives and taxes implemented to support increased generation of low carbon and renewable energy may affect customer demand for our products.\" Additionally, any other legislation or regulations that require permitting or reporting of GHG emissions or limit such emissions from our equipment and operations or from biomass-fired power plants operated by our customers, could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations, or negatively impact the demand for wood pellets. We also note that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth's atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nWater Discharges\nThe Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended (\"Clean Water Act\"), as well as state laws and regulations that implement, and may be more stringent than, the Clean Water Act, restrict the discharge of pollutants into waters of the United States. Any such discharge of pollutants must be performed in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by U.S. EPA or the implementing state agency. In addition, the Clean Water Act and implementing state laws and regulations require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations. These permits generally have a term of five years. Although our facilities are presently in compliance with these requirements, changes to the terms and conditions of our permits in future renewals or new or modified regulations could require us to incur additional capital or operating expenditures which may be material.\nPursuant to the Clean Water Act, U.S. EPA has adopted the Discharge of Oil Regulation, which requires any person in charge of an onshore facility to report any discharge of a harmful quantity of oil into U.S. navigable waters, adjoining shorelines or the contiguous zone. A harmful quantity is any quantity of discharged oil that violates state water quality standards, causes a film or sheen on the water's surface or leaves sludge or emulsion beneath the surface. Spills from our production plants that are located along waterways or from our deep-water marine terminal facilities may result in fines, penalties and obligations to respond to and remediate any such spills.\nSpill Response and Release Reporting\nCertain of our facilities are subject to federal requirements to prepare for and respond to spills or releases from tanks and other equipment located at these facilities and provide training to employees on operation, maintenance and discharge prevention procedures and the applicable pollution control\nlaws. At these facilities, we have developed or will develop Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure plans to memorialize these preparations and response plans and will update them on a regular basis. From time to time, these requirements may be made more stringent and may require us to modify our operations or expand our plans accordingly. The costs of implementing any such modifications or expansion may be significant. In addition, in the event of a spill or release, we may incur fines or penalties or incur responsibility for damage to natural resources, private property or personal injury in addition to obligations to respond to and remediate any such spill or release.\nEndangered Species Act\nThe federal Endangered Species Act, as amended (\"ESA\"), restricts activities that may affect endangered and threatened species or their habitats. Although some of our facilities may be located in areas that are designated as habitat for endangered or threatened species, we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the ESA. Moreover, as a result of a settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on September 9, 2011, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is required to make a determination on listing of more than 250 species as endangered or threatened under the ESA over the next six years, through the agency's 2017 fiscal year. The designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected areas, which could have an adverse impact on the availability or price of raw materials.\nCoastal Area Protection and Wetlands and Navigable Waters Activity Regulations\nOur Chesapeake terminal is a deep-water marine terminal facility. As a result, it is subject to the various federal and state programs that regulate the conservation and development of coastal resources. At the federal level, the Coastal Zone Management Act (\"CZMA\") was enacted to preserve, protect, develop and, where possible, restore or enhance valuable natural coastal resources of the United States coastal zone. The CZMA authorizes and provides grants for state management programs to regulate land and water use and coastal development.\nIn Virginia, the Virginia Coastal Zone Management Program (\"Virginia CZM Program\") administers the CZMA as established through Executive Order 18 (2010). A network of state agencies and local governments administer the Virginia CZM Program with the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality serving as the lead agency. The Chesapeake Bay Preservation Area Designation and Management Regulations provide specific regulations regarding the protection and improvement of water quality of the Chesapeake Bay and establish criteria for local governments in granting, denying or modifying zoning and development requests in certain areas. The City of Chesapeake has passed an ordinance creating the Chesapeake Bay Preservation Area District and adopting regulations for development within that district.\nIn addition to the CZMA, the Clean Water Act may result in federal or state regulators imposing conditions or restrictions on our operations or construction activities. For instance, the dredge and fill provisions of the Clean Water Act require a permit to conduct construction activities in protected waters and wetlands and prohibit unpermitted discharges of fill materials. Likewise, Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act also requires permits for the construction of certain port structures. We believe that we are in material compliance with these various requirements. However, any delays in obtaining future permits or renewals, or the inclusion of restrictive conditions in such permits, could adversely affect the cost of, or result in delays in, our operations and any future construction.\nSafety and Maintenance\nWe are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended (\"OSHA\"), and comparable state statutes, whose\npurpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. We have a corporate health and safety program that governs the way we conduct our operations at our facilities. Our employees receive OSHA training that is appropriate in light of the tasks performed at our facilities and general training on our health and safety plans. Compliance with OSHA and general training is mandatory. We perform preventive and routine maintenance on all of our manufacturing and deep-water marine terminaling systems, and make repairs and replacements when necessary or appropriate. We also conduct routine and required inspections of those assets in accordance with applicable regulations. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standards in the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local governmental authorities and citizens. Our facilities adhere to National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) standards for combustible dust and incorporate pollution control equipment such as cyclones, baghouses and electrostatic precipitators to minimize regulated emissions. Our deep-water marine terminaling facilities adhere to Homeland Security/U.S. Coast Guard regulations regarding physical security and emergency response plans. We continually strive to maintain compliance with applicable air, solid waste and wastewater regulations. Notwithstanding these preventative measures, we cannot guarantee that serious accidents will not occur in the future.\nSeasonality\nOur business is affected to some extent by seasonal fluctuations. The cost of producing wood pellets tends to be higher in the winter months because the delivered cost of fiber typically increases with wet weather and our raw materials have, on average, higher moisture content during this period of the year, resulting in a lower product yield. In addition, lower ambient temperatures increase the cost of drying wood fiber.\nPrincipal Executive Offices\nWe lease office space for our principal executive offices at 7200 Wisconsin Avenue, Suite 1000, Bethesda, Maryland 20814. The lease expires in June 2024.\nAvailable Information\nWe file annual, quarterly and current reports and other documents with the U.S. Securities Exchange Act Commission (\"SEC\") under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \"Exchange Act\"). You may read and copy any materials we file with the SEC at the SEC's Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549. You may obtain information on the operations of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at (800) SEC-0330. In addition, the SEC maintains a website at www.sec.gov that contains reports and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC.\nWe also make available free of charge our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, simultaneously with or as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such materials with, or furnishing such materials to, the SEC, and on or through our website, www.envivabiomass.com. The information on our website, or information about us on any other website, is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThere are many factors that could have a material adverse effect on the Partnership's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution. New risks may emerge at any time, and the Partnership cannot predict those risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect financial performance. Each of the risks described below could adversely impact the value of the Partnership's common units.\nRisks Inherent in Our Business\nWe may not have sufficient cash from operations following the establishment of cash reserves and payment of costs and expenses, including cost reimbursements to our General Partner and its affiliates, to enable us to pay quarterly distributions to our unitholders at our current distribution rate.\nWe may not have sufficient cash each quarter to enable us to pay quarterly distributions at our current distribution rate. The amount of cash we can distribute on our common and subordinated units principally depends upon the amount of cash we generate from our operations, which fluctuates from quarter to quarter based on the following factors, some of which are beyond our control:\n\u2022 the volume of products that we are able to sell;\n\u2022 the price at which we are able to sell our products;\n\u2022 failure of the Partnership's customers to pay or perform their contractual obligations to the Partnership;\n\u2022 the amount of low-cost wood fiber that we are able to procure and process, which could be adversely affected by, among other things, operating or financial difficulties suffered by our suppliers;\n\u2022 the amount of products that we are able to produce, which could be adversely affected by, among other things, operating difficulties;\n\u2022 failure of the Partnership's shipping partners to perform their contractual obligations to the Partnership;\n\u2022 changes in the price and availability of natural gas, coal or other sources of energy;\n\u2022 changes in prevailing economic conditions;\n\u2022 our ability to complete acquisitions, including acquisitions from our sponsor;\n\u2022 unanticipated ground, grade or water conditions;\n\u2022 inclement or hazardous weather conditions, including extreme precipitation, temperatures and flooding;\n\u2022 environmental hazards;\n\u2022 fires, explosions or other accidents;\n\u2022 changes in domestic and foreign laws and regulations (or the interpretation thereof) related to renewable or low-carbon energy, the forestry products industry or power generators;\n\u2022 changes in the regulatory treatment of biomass in core and emerging markets for utility-scale generation;\n\u2022 inability to acquire or maintain necessary permits or rights for our production, transportation and terminaling operations;\n\u2022 inability to obtain necessary production equipment or replacement parts;\n\u2022 technical difficulties or failures;\n\u2022 labor disputes;\n\u2022 late delivery of raw materials;\n\u2022 inability of our customers to take delivery of products or their rejection of delivery of products;\n\u2022 changes in the price and availability of transportation;\n\u2022 changes in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022 changes in the quality specifications for our products that are required by our customers; and\n\u2022 our ability to borrow funds and access capital markets.\nIn addition, the actual amount of cash we have available for distribution depends on other factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022 the level of capital expenditures we make;\n\u2022 costs associated with construction projects at our existing facilities and future construction projects;\n\u2022 fluctuations in our working capital needs;\n\u2022 our treatment as a flow-through entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes;\n\u2022 our debt service requirements and other liabilities;\n\u2022 restrictions contained in our existing or future debt agreements; and\n\u2022 the amount of cash reserves established by our General Partner.\nThe amount of cash we have available for distribution to holders of our units depends primarily on our cash flow and not solely on profitability, which may prevent us from making cash distributions during periods when we record net income.\nThe amount of cash we have available for distribution depends primarily upon our cash flow, including cash flow from reserves and working capital or other borrowings, and not solely on profitability, which will be affected by non-cash items. As a result, we may pay cash distributions during periods when we record net losses for financial accounting purposes and may be unable to pay cash distributions during periods when we record net income.\nWe have incurred losses from operations during certain periods since our inception and may do so in the future.\nWe incurred a net loss of $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Additionally, we may incur net losses in the future. The uncertainty and risks described in this Annual Report may impede our ability to remain profitable or have positive cash flows from operating activities in the future.\nSubstantially all of our revenues are generated under contracts with two customers, and the loss of any of them could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to make cash distributions. We may not be able to renew or obtain new and favorable contracts with these customers when our existing contracts expire, and we may not be able to obtain contracts with new customers, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nOur contracts with Drax and ENGIE represent substantially all of our sales volumes. Because we have a small number of customers, our off-take contracts subject us to counterparty risk concentration. The ability of each of our customers to perform its obligations under a contract with us will depend on\na number of factors that are beyond our control and may include, among other things, the overall financial condition of the counterparty, the counterparty's access to capital, the condition of the Northern European power generation industry, continuing economic support for wood pellet-generated power and general economic conditions. In addition, in depressed market conditions, our customers may no longer need the amount of our products they have contracted for or may be able to obtain comparable products at a lower price. If our customers experience a significant downturn in their business or financial condition, they may attempt to renegotiate or declare force majeure under our contracts. Recently, an affiliate of the owner of the Langerlo power station filed for insolvency in a German court, and although our customer is not party to the proceedings, the impact of the affiliate's insolvency on our customer's ability to perform its obligations under the Langerlo Contract remains uncertain. Should any counterparty fail to honor its obligations under a contract with us, we could sustain losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution. We may also decide to renegotiate our existing contracts on less favorable terms and at reduced volumes in order to preserve our relationships with our customers.\nUpon the expiration of our off-take contracts, our customers may decide not to recontract on terms as favorable to us as our current contracts, or at all. For example, our current customers may acquire wood pellets from other providers that offer more competitive pricing or logistics or develop their own sources of wood pellets. Some of our customers could also exit their current business or be acquired by other companies that purchase wood pellets from other providers. The demand for wood pellets or their prevailing prices at the time our current off-take contracts expire may also render entry into new long-term off-take contracts difficult or impossible.\nAny reduction in the amount of wood pellets purchased by our customers, renegotiation on less favorable terms, or inability to enter into new contracts on economically acceptable terms upon the expiration of our current contracts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, business and financial position, as well as our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders.\nWe derive substantially all of our revenues from customers in Northern Europe. If we fail to diversify our customer base in the future, our results of operations, business and financial position and ability to make cash distributions could be materially adversely affected.\nA substantial portion of our revenues has historically been derived from customers in Northern Europe, and our revenues have been heavily dependent on developments in the Northern European markets. If economic, political and financial market conditions in Europe remain uncertain as a result of continued weakness in European economies, our customers may respond by suspending, delaying or reducing their expenditures. Our failure to successfully penetrate markets outside of Northern Europe in the future could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, business and financial position, and our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders.\nOur exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations may result in fluctuations in our cash flows and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates could be material to us depending upon, among other things, the currency denominations of our off-take contracts. In particular, we may in the future be sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the British Pound as sales under the EVA-MGT Contract are denominated in pounds. Deliveries under the EVA-MGT Contract do not begin until 2019 and the contract is contingent upon the Tees REP reaching financial close.\nThere may be instances in which costs and revenue will not be matched with respect to currency denomination. As a result, to the extent that we continue to expand our customer base as anticipated,\nit is possible that increasing portions of revenue, costs, assets and liabilities will be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency valuations. We may experience economic loss and a negative impact on earnings or net assets solely as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nChanges in government policies, incentives and taxes implemented to support increased generation of low-carbon and renewable energy may affect customer demand for our products.\nConsumers of utility-grade wood pellets currently use our products either as part of a binding obligation to generate a certain percentage of low-carbon energy or because they receive direct or indirect financial support or incentives to do so. Financial support is often necessary to cover the generally higher costs of wood pellets compared to conventional fossil fuels like coal. In most countries, once the government implements a tax (e.g., the UK's carbon price floor tax) or a preferable tariff or a specific renewable energy policy either supporting a renewable energy generator or the energy generating sector as a whole, such tax, tariff or policy is guaranteed for a specified period of time, sometimes for the investment lifetime of any electricity generator's project. However, the government may modify its tax, tariff, or incentive regimes, and the future availability of such taxes, tariffs or policies, either in current jurisdictions beyond the prescribed timeframes or in new jurisdictions, is uncertain. Demand for wood pellets could be substantially lower than expected if government support is reduced or delayed or, in the future, is insufficient to enable successful deployment of biomass power to the levels currently projected. In addition, regulatory changes such as new requirements to install additional pollution control technology or curtail operations to meet new GHG emission limits, may also affect demand for our products. For example, in the U.S., current regulations exempt biomass-fired generating units from GHG emission regulations of U.S. EPA. In July 2013, the D.C. Circuit Court, in Center for Biological Diversity v. EPA vacated U.S. EPA's July 1, 2011 decision to grant a three-year deferral of the applicability of Prevention of Significant Deterioration (\"PSD\") and Title V permitting requirements for carbon dioxide emissions to certain biomass-fired generators. However, the D.C. Circuit Court also stayed its ruling and delayed any rehearing until after the Supreme Court issued its decision in Utility Air Regulatory Group (UARG) v. EPA, effectively leaving U.S. EPA's deferral in place. Although the U.S. Supreme Court issued its decision in UARG v. EPA in June 2014, generally upholding U.S. EPA's authority to regulate GHG emissions from certain stationary sources, there has been no resolution of the validity of U.S. EPA's exemption for biomass-fired facilities. On September 19, 2014, the D.C. Circuit Court issued an order extending the deadline to submit petitions for rehearing in Center for Biological Diversity v. EPA until the D.C. Circuit Court issues its mandate in a related case, Coalition for Responsible Regulation v. EPA. In June 2015, U.S. EPA requested the D.C. Circuit Court deny a rehearing since U.S. EPA's three-year deferral expired last year, making any challenges to the rule moot.\nIn August 2015, U.S. EPA issued its final CPP rule that establishes carbon pollution standards for existing power plants, called Carbon Dioxide (\"CO2\") emission performance rates. U.S. EPA expects each state to develop implementation plans for power plants in its state to meet the individual state targets established in the CPP. Although the rule calls for state plans to be submitted in September 2016, subject to potential extensions of up to two years for final plan submission, the recent Supreme Court stay of the rule creates significant uncertainty with respect to the timing of the development of state plans. The first Clean Power Plan compliance period begins in 2022, and emission reductions will be phased in up to 2030. U.S. EPA also proposed a federal compliance plan to implement the CPP in the event that an approvable state plan is not submitted to U.S. EPA. After the final rule was published in October 2015, over two dozen states and various industry groups filed several petitions that were later consolidated in the D.C. Circuit Court challenging the rule and seeking a stay of the CPP while litigation is ongoing. On February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay of the implementation of the CPP before the D.C. Circuit Court even issued a decision. By its terms, this stay will remain in effect throughout the pendency of the appeals process including at the D.C. Circuit Court and the Supreme Court through any certiorari petition that may be granted. The stay suspends\nthe rule, including the requirement that states submit their initial plans by September 2016. The Supreme Court's stay applies only to U.S. EPA's regulations for CO2 emissions from existing power plants and will not affect U.S. EPA's standards for new power plants. It is not yet clear how either the D.C. Circuit Court or the Supreme Court will rule on the legality of the CPP.\nEven if the final CPP withstands judicial review, the status of biomass under the rule is not clear. Although the final rule contemplates that states may use biomass as a tool to comply with their obligations to reduce GHG emissions from existing power plants, it does not provide clear guidance on how biomass policies may be implemented under the rule. U.S. EPA may issue supplemental guidance as part of its Model Trading Rules, but the timing of any future rulemakings or guidance to clarify the status of biomass under the CPP remains uncertain in light of the Supreme Court's stay of the rule. An additional source of uncertainty regarding future biomass guidance or rules from U.S. EPA is the outcome of its ongoing scientific process to assess biogenic carbon dioxide emissions from stationary sources. In November 2014, U.S. EPA released a revised methodological framework for assessing biogenic carbon dioxide emissions from stationary sources. U.S. EPA also released a memorandum explaining that it expects to recognize biogenic carbon dioxide emissions and climate policy benefits of waste-derived and certain forest-derived industrial byproduct feedstocks when considering state compliance plans under the CPP and the PSD program going forward. The updated draft framework is currently subject to review by U.S. EPA's Scientific Advisory Board (the \"SAB\"), and the SAB's final report should be submitted to U.S. EPA in 2016, raising the possibility that U.S. EPA will adopt a policy approach to address biogenic carbon dioxide emissions based upon the SAB's review of its proposed framework. Therefore, it is possible that in the future, U.S. EPA or individual states may seek (or be required) to regulate carbon dioxide or other GHG emissions from biomass-fired power plants, including requiring such plants to retroactively obtain permits or install pollution control technology. Such developments could negatively impact the demand for wood pellets and limit our growth in the U.S. market. In addition, regulatory actions to address GHG emissions from biomass in the U.S. could be used as precedents by regulators in our primary markets, and any subsequent changes in the regulatory schemes in Europe could impact demand for wood pellets.\nThe international nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks, including foreign exchange and unfavorable political, regulatory and tax conditions in foreign countries.\nSubstantially all of our current product sales are to customers that operate outside of the United States. As a result, we face certain risks inherent to maintaining international operations that include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022 foreign exchange movements, which may make it more difficult for our customers to make payments denominated in U.S. dollars or exert pricing pressure on new contracts compared to competitors that source in a weaker currency;\n\u2022 restrictions on foreign trade and investment, including currency exchange controls imposed by or in other countries; and\n\u2022 trade barriers such as export requirements, tariffs, taxes and other restrictions and expenses, which could increase the prices of our products and make our products less competitive in some countries.\nOur business in foreign countries requires us to respond to rapid changes in market conditions in these countries. Our overall success as a global business depends, in part, on our ability to succeed under differing legal, regulatory, economic, social and political conditions. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to develop, implement and maintain policies and strategies that will be effective in each location where our customers operate. Any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, business and financial position and our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders.\nFederal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to forestry products and the potential for related litigation could result in increased costs, additional operating restrictions or delays for our suppliers and customers, respectively, which could cause a decline in the demand for our products and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCurrently, our raw materials are byproducts of traditional timber harvesting, principally the tops and limbs of trees as well as other low-value wood materials that are generated in a harvest, and industrial residuals (chips, sawdust and other wood industry byproducts). Commercial forestry is regulated by complex regulatory frameworks at each of the federal, state, and local levels. Among other federal laws, the Clean Water Act and ESA have been applied to commercial forestry operations through agency regulations and court decisions, as well as through the delegation to states to implement and monitor compliance with such laws. State forestry laws, as well as land use regulations and zoning ordinances at the local level, are also used to manage forests in the Southeastern U.S., as well as other regions from which we may need to source raw materials in the future. Any new or modified laws or regulations at any of these levels could have the effect of reducing forestry operations in areas where we procure our raw materials, and consequently may prevent us from purchasing raw materials in an economic manner, or at all. In addition, future regulation of, or litigation concerning, the use of timberlands, the protection of endangered species, the promotion of forest biodiversity, and the response to and prevention of wildfires, as well as litigation, campaigns or other measures advanced by environmental activist groups, could also reduce the availability of the raw materials required for our operations.\nThe actions of certain non-governmental organizations could result in increased or adverse regulation of our business.\nCertain non-governmental organizations with an interest in environmental issues have expressed their opposition to the use of biomass for power generation, both publicly and directly to domestic and foreign regulators, policy makers, power generators and other industrial users of biomass. These organizations are also actively lobbying domestically and abroad to significantly increase the regulation of, and reduce or eliminate the incentives and support for, the production and use of biomass for power generation. These organizations may also seek to increase regulation through litigation. For example, in Center for Biological Diversity, et al. v. EPA, environmental groups contested U.S. EPA's decision to defer regulation of carbon dioxide emissions from biomass-fired power plants. It is possible that the continued efforts of these organizations, whether through lobbying, litigation or other means, will result in the adoption of regulation that could adversely affect our current operations or those of our customers or impede expansions. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, business and financial condition, and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders.\nThe viability of our customers' businesses may also affect demand for our products and the results of our business and operations.\nThe viability of our customers' businesses is dependent on their ability to compete in their respective electricity and heat markets. Our customers' competitiveness is a function of, among other things, the market price of electricity, the market price of competing fuels (e.g. coal and natural gas), the relative cost of carbon and the costs of generating heat or electricity using other renewable energy technologies. Changes in the values of the inputs and outputs of our customers' businesses, or of the businesses of their competitors, could have a material adverse effect on our customers and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, business and financial position, and our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders.\nThe growth of our business depends in part upon locating and acquiring interests in additional production plants and deep-water marine terminals at favorable prices.\nOur business strategy includes growing our business through drop-down and third-party acquisitions that result in an increase in our cash available for distribution per unit. Various factors could affect the availability of attractive projects to grow our business, including:\n\u2022 our sponsor's failure to complete its or the Hancock JV's development projects in a timely manner or at all, which could result from, among other things, permitting challenges, failure to procure the requisite financing or equipment, construction difficulties or an inability to obtain an off-take contract on acceptable terms;\n\u2022 our sponsor's failure to offer its assets or the assets of the Hancock JV for sale;\n\u2022 our failure or inability to exercise our right of first offer with respect to any asset that our sponsor offers, or compels the Hancock JV to offer, to us; and\n\u2022 fewer third-party acquisition opportunities than we expect, which could result from, among other things, available projects having less desirable economic returns, anti-trust concerns or higher risk profiles than we believe suitable for our business plan and investment strategy.\nAny of these factors could prevent us from executing our growth strategy or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, business and financial position, and our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders.\nAny acquisitions we make may reduce, rather than increase, our cash generated from operations on a per unit basis.\nWe may consummate acquisitions that we believe will be accretive, but that result in a decrease in our cash available for distribution per unit. Any acquisition involves potential risks, some of which are beyond our control, including, among other things:\n\u2022 mistaken assumptions about revenues and costs, including synergies;\n\u2022 the inability to successfully integrate the businesses we acquire;\n\u2022 the inability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel to manage and operate our business and newly acquired assets;\n\u2022 the assumption of unknown liabilities;\n\u2022 limitations on rights to indemnity from the seller;\n\u2022 mistaken assumptions about the overall costs of equity or debt;\n\u2022 the diversion of management's attention to other business concerns;\n\u2022 unforeseen difficulties in connection with operating in new product areas or new geographic areas;\n\u2022 customer or key employee losses at the acquired businesses; and\n\u2022 the inability to meet the obligations in off-take contracts associated with acquired production plants.\nIf we consummate any future acquisitions, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly, and unitholders will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in determining the application of our funds and other resources.\nIf there are significant increases in the cost of raw materials or our suppliers suffer from operating or financial difficulties, we could generate lower revenue, operating profits and cash flows or lose our ability to meet commitments to our customers.\nWe purchase wood fiber from third-party landowners and other suppliers for use at our production plants. Our reliance on third parties to secure wood fiber exposes us to potential price volatility and unavailability of such raw materials, and the associated costs may exceed our ability to pass through such price increases under our contracts with our customers. Further, delays or disruptions in obtaining wood fiber may result from a number of factors affecting our suppliers, including extreme weather, production or delivery disruptions, inadequate logging capacity, labor disputes, impaired financial condition of a particular supplier, the inability of suppliers to comply with regulatory or sustainability requirements or decreased availability of raw materials. In addition, other companies, whether or not in our industry, could procure wood fiber within our procurement areas and adversely change regional market dynamics, resulting in insufficient quantities of raw material or higher prices. Any of these events could increase our operating costs or prevent us from meeting our commitments to our customers, and thereby could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, business and financial position, and our ability to make distributions to our unitholders.\nAny interruption or delay in the supply of wood fiber, or our inability to obtain wood fiber at acceptable prices in a timely manner, could impair our ability to meet the demands of our customers and expand our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, business and financial position, and our ability to make distributions to our unitholders.\nWe are exposed to the credit risk of customers for our products, and any material nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers could adversely affect our financial results and cash available for distribution.\nWe are subject to the risk of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers, whose operations are concentrated in the Northern European power generation industry. Our credit procedures and policies may not be adequate to fully eliminate customer credit risk. If we fail to adequately assess the creditworthiness of existing or future customers, or if their creditworthiness deteriorates unexpectedly, any resulting unremedied nonpayment or nonperformance by them could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, business and financial position, and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders.\nWe could suffer a catastrophic failure of the shiploading equipment at the Port of Chesapeake or Port Panama City or be adversely impacted by a port closure.\nA significant portion of our total production is loaded for shipment utilizing automated conveyor and ship loading equipment at the Port of Chesapeake and Port Panama City. Should we suffer a catastrophic failure of this equipment, we could be unable to fulfill off-take obligations or incur substantial additional transportation costs that would reduce cash flow. We may also lose access to the ports or our facilities if they are closed for security or weather-related reasons.\nFluctuations in transportation costs and the availability or reliability of shipping, rail or truck transportation could reduce revenues by causing us to reduce our production or by impairing our ability to deliver products to our customers or the ability of our customers to take delivery.\nDisruptions of local or regional transportation services due to shortages of vessels, barges, railcars or trucks, weather-related problems, flooding, drought, accidents, mechanical difficulties, bankruptcy, strikes, lockouts, bottlenecks or other events could temporarily impair our ability to deliver products to our customers and might, in certain circumstances, constitute a force majeure event under our customer contracts, permitting our customers to suspend taking delivery of and paying for our products.\nIn addition, persistent disruptions in marine transportation may force us to halt production as we reach storage capacity at our deep-water marine terminals. Accordingly, if the transportation services we use to transport our products are disrupted, and we are unable to find alternative transportation providers, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, business and financial position, and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders.\nOur long-term, fixed price off-take contracts with our customers may preclude us from taking advantage of an increase in spot market prices for our products and only partially offset certain cost increases.\nOur off-take contracts set base prices subject to annual price escalation and other pricing adjustments for changes in certain of our underlying costs of operations. In periods of increased spot market prices, our revenues could be significantly lower than they would otherwise be as a result of being party to such contracts, reducing the net income and cash available for distribution that we would otherwise generate. In addition, our current and future competitors may be in a better position to take advantage of increases in spot market prices.\nEach of our off-take contracts provides for an annual price escalator, and certain of our off-take contracts provide for cost pass-through mechanisms for either stumpage or shipping fuel. However, these cost pass-through mechanisms only pass a portion of our total costs through to our customers. If our operating costs increase significantly during the terms of our off-take contracts beyond the levels of pricing and cost protection afforded to us under the terms of our contracts, our results of operations, business and financial position, and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders could be materially adversely affected.\nTermination penalties within our off-take contracts may not fully compensate us for total economic losses suffered by us.\nCertain of our off-take contracts provide the customer with a right of termination for various events of convenience or changes in law or policy. Although certain of these contracts are subject to certain protective termination payments, the termination payments made by our customers may not fully compensate us for losses resulting from a termination by such counterparty. In each case, we may be unable to re-contract our production at favorable prices or at all, and our results of operations, business and financial position, and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders may be materially adversely affected as a result.\nWe may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to maintain our facilities.\nAlthough we currently use a portion of our cash reserves and cash generated from our operations to maintain, develop and improve our assets and facilities, such investment may, over time, be insufficient to preserve the operating profile required for us to meet our planned profitability. Accordingly, if additional capital expenditures are required, our results of operations, business and financial position, and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders may be materially adversely affected.\nWe compete with other wood pellet producers, and, if growth in domestic and global demand for wood pellets meets or exceeds management's expectations, the competition within our industry may grow significantly.\nWe compete with other wood pellet production companies in the United States for the customers to whom we sell our products. Other current producers of utility-grade wood pellets in North America include Fram Renewable Fuels, LLC, which is owned by an individual investor, Georgia Biomass, LLC, a plant owned by RWE Innogy, Rentech, Inc., Pacific BioEnergy, Pinnacle Renewable Energy Inc., Drax Biomass Inc., affiliates of German Pellets GmbH, The Navigator Company, S.A., Zilkha Biomass LLC and The Westervelt Company. Competition in our industry is based on price, consistency\nand quality of product, site location, distribution and logistics capabilities, customer service and reliability of supply. Some of our competitors may have greater financial and other resources than we do, may develop technology superior to ours or may have production plants that are sited in more advantageous locations from a transport or other cost perspective.\nIn addition, we expect global demand for solid biomass to increase significantly in the coming years. This demand growth may lead to a significant increase in the production levels of our existing competitors and may incentivize new, well-capitalized competitors to enter the industry, both of which could reduce the demand and the prices we are able to obtain under future off-take contracts. Significant price decreases or reduced demand could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, business and financial position, and our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders.\nFor our products to be acceptable to our customers, they must comply with stringent sustainability requirements, of which some elements are still under development.\nBiomass energy generation requires the use of biomass that is from acceptable sources and is demonstrably sustainable. Within Europe (and the United Kingdom, in particular), this is implemented through biomass sustainability criteria, which will become a mandatory element of eligibility for financial subsidies to biomass energy generators in the future. As a biomass fuel supplier, the viability of our business is therefore dependent upon our ability to comply with such requirements. This may restrict the types of biomass we can use and the geographic regions from which we source our raw materials, and may require us to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions associated with our supply and production processes. Currently, some elements of the criteria with which we will have to comply, including rules relating to forest management practices, are not yet finalized. If more stringent sustainability requirements are adopted in the future, demand for our products could be materially reduced in certain markets, and our results of operations, business and financial position, and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders may be materially adversely affected as a result.\nOur level of indebtedness may increase and reduce our financial flexibility.\nIn April 2015, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the \"Credit Agreement\") providing for (i) a $174.5 million term loan facility and (ii) a $25.0 million revolving credit facility (collectively, the \"Original Credit Facilities\"). In December 2015, we entered into the First Incremental Term Loan Assumption Agreement (the \"Assumption Agreement\") providing for $36.5 million of incremental borrowing (the \"Incremental Term Advances\" and, together with the Original Credit Facilities, the \"Senior Secured Credit Facilities\") under the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2015, our total debt was $213.2 million, which was primarily comprised of $206.8 million outstanding under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, $3.3 million related to a construction loan and working capital line due 2016 related to our Wiggins plant, a note in the amount of $2.0 million due 2017 related to the acquisition of our Amory plant and a promissory note of $0.7 million due 2017 related to the land purchase for the Southampton plant development and other loans and capital leases totaling $0.4 million. In the future, we may incur additional indebtedness in order to make acquisitions or to develop our properties. Our level of indebtedness could affect our operations in several ways, including the following:\n\u2022 a significant portion of our cash flows could be used to service our indebtedness;\n\u2022 the covenants contained in the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness may limit our ability to borrow additional funds, dispose of assets, pay distributions and make certain investments;\n\u2022 our debt covenants may also affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in the economy and in our industry;\n\u2022 a high level of debt would increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022 a high level of debt may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged and therefore may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our indebtedness would prevent us from pursuing; and\n\u2022 a high level of debt may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions, general partnership or other purposes.\nIn addition, borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and potentially other credit facilities we or our subsidiaries may enter into in the future will bear interest at variable rates. If market interest rates increase, such variable-rate debt will create higher debt service requirements, which could adversely affect our cash flow.\nIn addition to our debt service obligations, our operations require substantial expenditures on a continuing basis. Our ability to make scheduled debt payments, to refinance our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and to fund capital and non-capital expenditures necessary to maintain the condition of our operating assets and properties, as well as to provide capacity for the growth of our business, depends on our financial and operating performance. General economic conditions and financial, business and other factors affect our operations and our future performance. Many of these factors are beyond our control. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to pay the interest on our debt, and future working capital, borrowings or equity financing may not be available to pay or refinance such debt.\nAn increase in the price or a significant interruption in the supply of electricity could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur production plants use a substantial amount of electricity. The price and supply of electricity are unpredictable and can fluctuate significantly based on international, political and economic circumstances, as well as other events outside our control, such as changes in supply and demand due to weather conditions, regional production patterns and environmental concerns. In addition, potential climate change regulations or carbon or emissions taxes could result in higher production costs for electricity, which may be passed on to us in whole or in part. A significant increase in the price of electricity or an extended interruption in the supply of electricity to our production plants could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and ability to make cash distributions.\nChanges in the price of diesel fuel may adversely affect our results of operations.\nDiesel fuel costs generally fluctuate with world crude oil prices, and accordingly are subject to political, economic and market factors that are outside of our control. Our operations are dependent on rolling stock and trucks, and diesel fuel costs are a significant component of the operating expense of these vehicles. In addition, diesel fuel is consumed by our wood suppliers in the harvesting and transport of our raw material and is therefore a component of the delivered cost we pay for wood fiber. It is also consumed by the changes in handling equipment at our facilities. Some of our off-take contracts contain mechanisms that are intended to reduce the impact that changes in the price of diesel fuel would have on us, but these mechanisms may not be effective. Accordingly, changes in diesel fuel prices could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and ability to make cash distributions.\nOur business may suffer if we lose, or are unable to attract and retain, key personnel.\nWe depend to a large extent on the services of our senior management team and other key personnel. Members of our senior management and other key employees collectively have extensive expertise in designing, building and operating wood pellet production plants, negotiating long-term off-take contracts and managing businesses such as ours. Competition for management and key personnel is intense, and the pool of qualified candidates is limited. The loss of any of these individuals or the failure to attract additional personnel, as needed, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and could lead to higher labor costs or the use of less-qualified personnel. In addition, if any of our executives or other key employees were to join a competitor or form a competing company, we could lose customers, suppliers, know-how and key personnel. Our success is dependent on our ability to continue to attract, employ and retain highly skilled personnel.\nFailure to maintain effective quality control systems at our production plants and deep-water marine terminals could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nThe performance and quality of our products are critical to the success of our business. These factors depend significantly on the effectiveness of our quality control systems which, in turn, depends on a number of factors. These include the design of our quality control systems, our quality training program and our ability to ensure that our employees adhere to our quality control policies and guidelines. Any significant failure or deterioration of our quality control systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.\nOur operations are subject to operational hazards and downtimes or interruptions, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operation. We may also not be adequately insured against such events.\nWe produce a combustible product. Fires and explosions have occurred in our industry. As a result, our business could be adversely affected by these and other operational hazards and could suffer catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as explosions, fires, natural disasters or severe weather conditions. Severe weather, such as floods, earthquakes, hurricanes or other catastrophes, or climatic phenomena, such as drought, may impact our operations by causing weather-related damage to our facilities and equipment and impact our customers' ability to take delivery of our products. Such severe weather may also adversely affect the ability of our suppliers to provide us with the raw materials we require or the ability of vessels to load, transport and unload our product. In addition, our facilities are subject to the risk of unexpected equipment failures. At our production plants, our manufacturing processes are dependent upon critical pieces of equipment, and such equipment may, on occasion, be out of service as a result of such failures. As a result, we may experience material plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production.\nAny interference with or curtailment of our operations could result in a loss of productivity, an increase in our operating costs or a breach of our obligations to deliver contracted volumes to our customers. Any breach of our contractual obligations as a result of periods of downtime or reduced production may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and ability to make cash distributions.\nIn addition, we may not be fully insured against all risks incident to our business, including the risk of our operations being interrupted due to severe weather and natural disasters. Furthermore, we may be unable to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies could escalate. In some instances, insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we are not fully insured, it could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution to unitholders.\nOur operations are subject to stringent environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities.\nOur operations are subject to stringent federal, regional, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern environmental protection, occupational health and safety, the release or discharge of materials into the environment, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the investigation and remediation of contaminated sites and allocation of liability for cleanup of such sites. These laws and regulations may restrict or impact our business in many ways, including by requiring us to acquire permits or other approvals to conduct regulated activities; limiting our air emissions or wastewater discharges or requiring us to install costly equipment to control, reduce or treat such emissions or discharges; imposing requirements on the handling or disposal of wastes; impacting our ability to modify or expand our operations (for example, by limiting or prohibiting construction and operating activities in environmentally sensitive areas); and imposing health and safety requirements for worker protection. We may be required to make significant capital and operating expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations, suspension or revocation of permits and the issuance of orders limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations. Adoption of new or modified environmental laws and regulations may impair the operation of our business, delay or prevent expansion of existing facilities or construction of new facilities and otherwise result in increased costs and liabilities, which may be material.\nCertain environmental laws, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act and analogous state laws, impose strict as well as joint and several liability without regard to comparative fault. Under these laws, we may be required to remediate contaminated properties currently or formerly operated by us, or facilities of third parties that received waste generated by our operations. Such remediation obligations may be imposed regardless of whether such contamination resulted in whole or in part from the conduct of others and whether such contamination resulted from actions (by us or third parties) that complied with all applicable laws in effect at the time of those actions. In addition, claims for damages to persons or property, including natural resources, may result from the environmental, health and safety impacts of our operations, including accidental spills or releases in the course of our operations or those of a third party. Although we are not presently aware of any material contamination on our properties or any material remediation liabilities, there is no assurance that we will not be exposed to significant remediation obligations or liabilities in the future.\nClimate change legislation, regulatory initiatives and litigation could result in increased operating costs.\nU.S. EPA has recently issued regulations that would limit GHGs from certain existing and new electric generating units, and the Supreme Court has upheld U.S. EPA's authority to regulate GHG emissions from certain stationary sources. In August 2015, U.S. EPA issued its final CPP rule establishing carbon pollution standards for power plants and setting a target carbon emissions reduction in the power sector of 32% below 2005 levels by 2030. U.S. EPA expected each state to develop implementation plans for power plants in its state to meet the individual state targets established in the CPP. U.S. EPA also proposed a federal compliance plan to implement the CPP in the event that an approvable state plan was not submitted to U.S. EPA. After the final rule was published in October 2015, over two dozen states and various industry groups filed several petitions that were later consolidated in the D.C. Circuit Court challenging the rule and seeking a stay of the CPP while litigation is ongoing. On February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay of the\nimplementation of the CPP before the D.C. Circuit Court even issued a decision. By its terms, this stay will remain in effect throughout the pendency of the appeals process including at the D.C. Circuit Court and the Supreme Court through any certiorari petition that may be granted. The stay suspends the rule, including the requirement that states submit their initial plans by September 2016. The Supreme Court's stay applies only to U.S. EPA's regulations for CO2 emissions from existing power plants and will not affect U.S. EPA's standards for new power plants. It is not yet clear how either the D.C. Circuit Court or the Supreme Court will rule on the legality of the CPP.\nAlthough the legal challenges to the CPP are ongoing, U.S. EPA may still proceed with other activities to address climate change that could impact our operations. Previously, U.S. EPA adopted GHG regulations under its existing Clean Air Act authority, including regulations requiring monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions and consideration of potential emission controls for certain new or modified facilities. In a November 2014 memorandum, U.S. EPA exempted biogenic carbon dioxide from consideration under the existing permitting regime for GHGs from stationary sources (the PSD permitting program). However, recent progress in the SAB's review of U.S. EPA's proposed framework to assess biogenic carbon dioxide emissions increases the likelihood that U.S. EPA will finalize an approach to include biogenic carbon dioxide emissions in stationary source permitting.\nShould U.S. EPA finalize an approach to biogenic carbon dioxide emissions under either the CPP or a framework for permitting GHG emissions from new sources, the use of biomass to reduce GHG emissions reductions in the U.S. regulatory context could require us to undertake substantial additional tracking and monitoring of sources within our supply chain, which could increase our operating costs.\nIn addition, U.S. EPA is still evaluating its approach to the treatment of biogenic carbon dioxide emissions from stationary sources. The adoption of a different approach in the United States could be treated as precedential by European regulators and impact the regulatory treatment of our product in our primary markets.\nAlso, almost half of U.S. states, either individually or through multi-state regional initiatives, have begun to address GHG emissions, primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap-and-trade programs. Although neither the U.S. Congress nor the states in which our facilities are located have adopted such legislation at this time, they may do so in the future.\nMany nations have agreed to limit emissions of GHGs pursuant to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and more recently, in December 2015, 195 countries met in Paris, France to approve a landmark climate accord. The United States is one of the nations participating in the adoption of the new Paris Agreement to cut GHG emissions. If the Paris agreement enters into force, it could be the basis for individual countries to undertake efforts to reduce GHG emissions.\nAlthough it is not possible at this time to accurately estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws or implementing regulations could require us to incur increased operating or maintenance costs, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business and operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations.\nOur business is affected to some extent by seasonal fluctuations. The cost of producing wood pellets tends to be higher in the winter months because the delivered cost of fiber typically increases with wet weather and our raw materials have, on average, higher moisture content during such period of the year, resulting in a lower product yield. In addition, lower ambient temperatures increase the cost of drying wood fiber. As a result of these seasonal fluctuations, comparisons of operating measures between consecutive quarters may not be as meaningful as comparisons between longer reporting periods.\nA terrorist attack or armed conflict could harm our business.\nTerrorist activities and armed conflicts could adversely affect the U.S. and global economies and could prevent us from meeting financial and other obligations or prevent our customers from meeting their obligations to us. We could experience loss of business, delays or defaults in payments from customers or disruptions of fuel supplies and markets, including if domestic and global power generators are direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terror or war. Terrorist activities and the threat of potential terrorist activities and any resulting economic downturn could adversely affect our results of operations, impair our ability to raise capital or otherwise adversely impact our ability to realize certain business strategies.\nRisks Related to Our Partnership Structure\nEnviva Holdings, LP owns and controls our General Partner, which has sole responsibility for conducting our business and managing our operations. Our General Partner and its affiliates, including Enviva Holdings, LP, have conflicts of interest with us and limited duties, and they may favor their own interests to our detriment and that of our unitholders.\nEnviva Holdings, LP, owns and controls our General Partner and appoints all of the directors of our General Partner. Although our General Partner has a duty to manage us in a manner that it believes is not adverse to our interest, the executive officers and directors of our General Partner have a fiduciary duty to manage our General Partner in a manner beneficial to our sponsor. Therefore, conflicts of interest may arise between our sponsor or any of its affiliates, including our General Partner, on the one hand, and us or any of our unitholders, on the other hand. In resolving these conflicts of interest, our General Partner may favor its own interests and the interests of its affiliates over the interests of our common unitholders. These conflicts include the following situations, among others:\n\u2022 our General Partner is allowed to take into account the interests of parties other than us, such as our sponsor, in exercising certain rights under our partnership agreement;\n\u2022 neither our partnership agreement nor any other agreement requires our sponsor to pursue a business strategy that favors us;\n\u2022 our partnership agreement eliminates and replaces the fiduciary duties that would otherwise be owed by our General Partner with contractual standards governing its duties, limits our General Partner's liabilities and restricts the remedies available to our unitholders for actions that, without such eliminations and limitations, might constitute breaches of fiduciary duty;\n\u2022 except in limited circumstances, our General Partner has the power and authority to conduct our business without unitholder approval;\n\u2022 our General Partner determines the amount and timing of asset purchases and sales, borrowings, issuances of additional partnership securities and the level of reserves, each of which can affect the amount of cash that is distributed to our unitholders;\n\u2022 our General Partner determines the amount and timing of any cash expenditure and whether an expenditure is classified as a maintenance capital expenditure, which reduces operating surplus, or an expansion capital expenditure, which does not reduce operating surplus. This determination can affect the amount of cash from operating surplus that is distributed to our unitholders which, in turn, may affect the ability of the subordinated units to convert into common units;\n\u2022 our General Partner may cause us to borrow funds in order to permit the payment of cash distributions;\n\u2022 our partnership agreement permits us to distribute up to $39.3 million as operating surplus, even if it is generated from asset sales, borrowings other than working capital borrowings or other sources that would otherwise constitute capital surplus. This cash may be used to fund distributions on our subordinated units or the incentive distribution rights;\n\u2022 our General Partner determines which costs incurred by it and its affiliates are reimbursable by us;\n\u2022 our partnership agreement does not restrict our General Partner from causing us to pay it or its affiliates for any services rendered to us or entering into additional contractual arrangements with its affiliates on our behalf;\n\u2022 our General Partner intends to limit its liability regarding our contractual and other obligations;\n\u2022 our General Partner may exercise its right to call and purchase common units if it and its affiliates own more than 80% of the common units;\n\u2022 our General Partner controls the enforcement of obligations that it and its affiliates owe to us;\n\u2022 our General Partner decides whether to retain separate counsel, accountants or others to perform services for us; and\n\u2022 our General Partner may elect to cause us to issue common units to it in connection with a resetting of the target distribution levels related to our General Partner's incentive distribution rights without the approval of the conflicts committee of the board of directors of our General Partner or the unitholders. This election may result in lower distributions to the common unitholders in certain situations.\nIn addition, we may compete directly with our sponsor and entities in which it has an interest for acquisition opportunities and potentially will compete with these entities for new business or extensions of the existing services provided by us.\nThe board of directors of our General Partner may modify or revoke our cash distribution policy at any time at its discretion. Our partnership agreement does not require us to pay any distributions at all.\nPursuant to our cash distribution policy, we intend to distribute quarterly at least $0.4125 per unit on all of our units to the extent we have sufficient cash after the establishment of cash reserves and the payment of our expenses, including payments to our General Partner and its affiliates. However, the board may change such policy at any time at its discretion and could elect not to pay distributions for one or more quarters. Please read Part II, Item 5. \"Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities-Cash Distribution Policy.\"\nIn addition, our partnership agreement does not require us to pay any distributions at all. Accordingly, investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the permanence of such a policy in making an investment decision. Any modification or revocation of our cash distribution policy could substantially reduce or eliminate the amounts of distributions to our unitholders. The amount of distributions we make, if any, and the decision to make any distribution at all will be determined by the board of directors of our General Partner, whose interests may differ from those of our common unitholders. Our General Partner has limited duties to our unitholders, which may permit it to favor its own interests or the interests of our sponsor to the detriment of our common unitholders.\nOur General Partner limits its liability regarding our obligations.\nOur General Partner limits its liability under contractual arrangements between us and third parties so that the counterparties to such arrangements have recourse only against our assets, and not against our General Partner or its assets. Our General Partner may therefore cause us to incur\nindebtedness or other obligations that are nonrecourse to our General Partner. Our partnership agreement provides that any action taken by our General Partner to limit its liability is not a breach of our General Partner's duties, even if we could have obtained more favorable terms without the limitation on liability. In addition, we are obligated to reimburse or indemnify our General Partner to the extent that it incurs obligations on our behalf. Any such reimbursement or indemnification payments would reduce the amount of cash otherwise available for distribution to our unitholders.\nWe intend to distribute a significant portion of our cash available for distribution to our partners, which could limit our ability to grow and make acquisitions.\nWe intend to distribute most of our cash available for distribution, which may cause our growth to proceed at a slower pace than that of businesses that reinvest their cash to expand ongoing operations. To the extent we issue additional units in connection with any acquisitions or expansion capital expenditures, the payment of distributions on those additional units may increase the risk that we will be unable to maintain or increase our per unit distribution level. There are no limitations in our partnership agreement on our ability to issue additional units, including units ranking senior to the common units. The incurrence of additional commercial borrowings or other debt to finance our growth strategy would result in increased interest expense, which, in turn, may impact the cash that we have available to distribute to our unitholders.\nOur partnership agreement eliminates and replaces our General Partner's fiduciary duties to holders of our units.\nOur partnership agreement contains provisions that eliminate and replace the fiduciary standards to which our General Partner would otherwise be held by state fiduciary duty law. For example, our partnership agreement permits our General Partner to make a number of decisions in its individual capacity, as opposed to in its capacity as our general partner, or otherwise free of fiduciary duties to us and our unitholders. This entitles our General Partner to consider only the interests and factors that it desires and relieves it of any duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of, or factors affecting, us, our affiliates or our limited partners. Examples of decisions that our General Partner may make in its individual capacity include:\n\u2022 how to allocate business opportunities among us and its affiliates;\n\u2022 whether to exercise its call right;\n\u2022 whether to seek approval of the resolutions of a conflict of interest by the conflicts committee of the board of directors of our General Partner;\n\u2022 how to exercise its voting rights with respect to the units it owns;\n\u2022 whether to exercise its registration rights;\n\u2022 whether to elect to reset target distribution levels; and\n\u2022 whether or not to consent to any merger or consolidation of the partnership or amendment to the partnership agreement.\nLimited partners who own common units are treated as having consented to the provisions in the partnership agreement, including the provisions discussed above.\nOur partnership agreement restricts the remedies available to holders of our units for actions taken by our General Partner that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty.\nOur partnership agreement contains provisions that restrict the remedies available to unitholders for actions taken by our General Partner that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty under state fiduciary duty law. For example, our partnership agreement provides that:\n\u2022 whenever our General Partner makes a determination or takes, or declines to take, any other action in its capacity as our general partner, our General Partner is generally required to make such determination, or take or decline to take such other action, in good faith, and will not be subject to any higher standard imposed by our partnership agreement, Delaware law, or any other law, rule or regulation, or at equity;\n\u2022 our General Partner and its officers and directors will not be liable for monetary damages or otherwise to us or our limited partners resulting from any act or omission unless there has been a final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that such losses or liabilities were the result of conduct in which our General Partner or its officers or directors engaged in bad faith, meaning that they believed that the decision was adverse to the interest of the partnership or, with respect to any criminal conduct, with knowledge that such conduct was unlawful; and\n\u2022 our General Partner will not be in breach of its obligations under the partnership agreement or its duties to us or our limited partners if a transaction with an affiliate or the resolution of a conflict of interest is:\n(1)approved by the conflicts committee of the board of directors of our General Partner, although our General Partner is not obligated to seek such approval; or\n(2)approved by the vote of a majority of the outstanding common units, excluding any common units owned by our General Partner and its affiliates.\nIn connection with a situation involving a transaction with an affiliate or a conflict of interest, other than one where our General Partner is permitted to act in its sole discretion, any determination by our General Partner must be made in good faith. If an affiliate transaction or the resolution of a conflict of interest is not approved by our common unitholders or the conflicts committee then it will be presumed that, in making its decision, taking any action or failing to act, the board of directors acted in good faith, and in any proceeding brought by or on behalf of any limited partner or the partnership, the person bringing or prosecuting such proceeding will have the burden of overcoming such presumption.\nOur sponsor and other affiliates of our General Partner may compete with us.\nOur partnership agreement provides that our General Partner is restricted from engaging in any business activities other than acting as our general partner, engaging in those activities incidental to its ownership interest in us and providing management, advisory and administrative services to its affiliates or to other persons. However, affiliates of our General Partner, including our sponsor, are not prohibited from engaging in other businesses or activities, including those that might be in direct competition with us. In addition, our sponsor may compete with us for investment opportunities and may own an interest in entities that compete with us.\nPursuant to the terms of our partnership agreement, the doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any analogous doctrine, does not apply to our General Partner or any of its affiliates, including its executive officers and directors and our sponsor. Any such person or entity that becomes aware of a potential transaction, agreement, arrangement or other matter that may be an opportunity for us will not have any duty to communicate or offer such opportunity to us. Any such person or entity will not be liable\nto us or to any limited partner for breach of any fiduciary duty or other duty by reason of the fact that such person or entity pursues or acquires such opportunity for itself, directs such opportunity to another person or entity or does not communicate such opportunity or information to us. This may create actual and potential conflicts of interest between us and affiliates of our General Partner and result in less than favorable treatment of us and our unitholders.\nThe holder or holders of our incentive distribution rights may elect to cause us to issue common units to it in connection with a resetting of the incentive distribution without the approval of our unitholders. This election may result in lower distributions to our common unitholders in certain situations.\nThe holder or holders of a majority of our incentive distribution rights (currently our General Partner) have the right, at any time when there are no subordinated units outstanding and we have made cash distributions in excess of the then-applicable third target distribution for each of the prior four consecutive fiscal quarters, to reset the initial target distribution levels at higher levels based on our cash distribution levels at the time of the exercise of the reset election. Following a reset election, a baseline distribution amount will be calculated equal to an amount equal to the prior cash distribution per common unit for the fiscal quarter immediately preceding the reset election (such amount is referred to as the \"reset minimum quarterly distribution\"), and the target distribution levels will be reset to correspondingly higher levels based on percentage increases above the reset minimum quarterly distribution.\nWe anticipate that our General Partner would exercise this reset right in order to facilitate acquisitions or internal growth projects that would not be sufficiently accretive to cash distributions per unit without such conversion. However, our General Partner may transfer the incentive distribution rights at any time. It is possible that our General Partner or a transferee could exercise this reset election at a time when we are experiencing declines in our aggregate cash distributions or at a time when the holders of the incentive distribution rights expect that we will experience declines in our aggregate cash distributions in the foreseeable future. In such situations, the holders of the incentive distribution rights may be experiencing, or may expect to experience, declines in the cash distributions it receives related to the incentive distribution rights and may therefore desire to be issued our common units, which are entitled to specified priorities with respect to our distributions and which therefore may be more advantageous for them to own in lieu of the right to receive incentive distribution payments based on target distribution levels that are less certain to be achieved. As a result, a reset election may cause our common unitholders to experience dilution in the amount of cash distributions that they would have otherwise received had we not issued new common units to the holders of the incentive distribution rights in connection with resetting the target distribution levels.\nHolders of our common units have limited voting rights and are not entitled to elect our General Partner or its directors, which could reduce the price at which our common units will trade.\nCompared to the holders of common stock in a corporation, unitholders have limited voting rights and, therefore, limited ability to influence management's decisions regarding our business. Unitholders have no right on an annual or ongoing basis to elect our General Partner or its board of directors. The board of directors of our General Partner, including the independent directors, is chosen entirely by our sponsor, as a result of it owning our General Partner, and not by our unitholders. Unlike publicly traded corporations, we do not conduct annual meetings of our unitholders to elect directors or conduct other matters routinely conducted at annual meetings of stockholders of corporations. As a result of these limitations, the price at which the common units trade could be diminished because of the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price.\nEven if holders of our common units are dissatisfied, they cannot currently remove our General Partner without our sponsor's consent.\nIf our unitholders are dissatisfied with the performance of our General Partner, they have limited ability to remove our General Partner. Unitholders are currently unable to remove our General Partner without our sponsor's consent because our sponsor and its affiliates own sufficient units to be able to prevent its removal. The vote of the holders of at least 662/3% of all outstanding common and subordinated units voting together as a single class is required to remove our General Partner. As of March 1, 2016, our sponsor owned an aggregate of 53.5% of our common and subordinated units. In addition, any vote to remove our General Partner during the subordination period must provide for the election of a successor General Partner by the holders of a majority of the common units and a majority of the subordinated units, voting as separate classes. Both of these conditions provide our sponsor the ability to prevent the removal of our General Partner.\nOur general partner interest or the control of our General Partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent.\nOur General Partner may transfer its general partner interest to a third party without the consent of our unitholders. Furthermore, our partnership agreement does not restrict the ability of the owner of our General Partner to transfer its membership interests in our General Partner to a third party. The new owner of our General Partner would then be in a position to replace the board of directors and executive officers of our General Partner with its own designees and thereby exert significant control over the decisions taken by the board of directors and executive officers of our General Partner. This effectively permits a \"change of control\" without the vote or consent of the unitholders.\nThe incentive distribution rights may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent.\nOur General Partner may transfer the incentive distribution rights to a third party at any time without the consent of our unitholders. If our General Partner transfers the incentive distribution rights to a third party, our General Partner would not have the same incentive to grow our partnership and increase quarterly distributions to unitholders over time. For example, a transfer of incentive distribution rights by our General Partner could reduce the likelihood of our sponsor accepting offers made by us relating to assets owned by our sponsor, as it would have less of an economic incentive to grow our business, which in turn would impact our ability to grow our asset base.\nOur General Partner has a call right that may require unitholders to sell their common units at an undesirable time or price.\nIf at any time our General Partner and its affiliates own more than 80% of the common units, our General Partner will have the right, which it may assign to any of its affiliates or to us, but not the obligation, to acquire all, but not less than all, of the common units held by unaffiliated persons at a price equal to the greater of (1) the average of the daily closing price of the common units over the 20 trading days preceding the date three days before notice of exercise of the call right is first mailed and (2) the highest per-unit price paid by our General Partner or any of its affiliates for common units during the 90-day period preceding the date such notice is first mailed. As a result, unitholders may be required to sell their common units at an undesirable time or price and may not receive any return or a negative return on their investment. Unitholders may also incur a tax liability upon a sale of their units. Our General Partner is not obligated to obtain a fairness opinion regarding the value of the common units to be repurchased by it upon exercise of the call right. There is no restriction in our partnership agreement that prevents our General Partner from causing us to issue additional common units and then exercising its call right. If our General Partner exercised its call right, the effect would be to take us private and, if the units were subsequently deregistered, we would no longer be subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act.\nWe may issue additional units without unitholder approval, which would dilute existing unitholder ownership interests.\nOur partnership agreement does not limit the number of additional limited partner interests we may issue at any time without the approval of our unitholders. The issuance of additional common units or other equity interests of equal or senior rank will have the following effects:\n\u2022 our existing unitholders' proportionate ownership interest in us will decrease;\n\u2022 the amount of cash available for distribution on each unit may decrease;\n\u2022 because a lower percentage of total outstanding units will be subordinated units, the risk that a shortfall in the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution will be borne by our common unitholders will increase;\n\u2022 the ratio of taxable income to distributions may increase;\n\u2022 the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding unit may be diminished; and\n\u2022 the market price of the common units may decline.\nThere are no limitations in our partnership agreement on our ability to issue units ranking senior to the common units.\nIn accordance with Delaware law and the provisions of our partnership agreement, we may issue additional partnership interests that are senior to the common units in right of distribution, liquidation and voting. The issuance by us of units of senior rank may (i) reduce or eliminate the amount of cash available for distribution to our common unitholders; (ii) diminish the relative voting strength of the total common units outstanding as a class; or (iii) subordinate the claims of the common unitholders to our assets in the event of our liquidation.\nThe market price of our common units could be adversely affected by sales of substantial amounts of our common units in the public or private markets, including sales by our sponsor or other large holders.\nAll of the subordinated units will convert into common units on a one-for-one basis at the end of the subordination period. Additionally, our sponsor has registration rights with respect to the common units it holds. Sales by our sponsor or other large holders of a substantial number of our common units in the public markets, or the perception that such sales might occur, could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common units or could impair our ability to obtain capital through an offering of equity securities.\nOur partnership agreement restricts the voting rights of unitholders owning 20% or more of our common units.\nOur partnership agreement restricts unitholders' voting rights by providing that any units held by a person or group that owns 20% or more of any class of units then outstanding, other than our General Partner and its affiliates, their transferees and persons who acquired such units with the prior approval of the board of directors of our General Partner, cannot vote on any matter.\nCost reimbursements due to our General Partner and its affiliates for services provided to us or on our behalf will reduce cash available for distribution to our unitholders. The amount and timing of such reimbursements will be determined by our General Partner.\nUnder our management services agreement with Enviva Management (the \"MSA\"), we are obligated to reimburse Enviva Management for all direct or indirect costs and expenses incurred by, or chargeable to, Enviva Management in connection with its provision of services necessary for the\noperation of our business. If the MSA were terminated without replacement, or our General Partner or its affiliates provided services outside of the scope of the MSA, our partnership agreement would require us to reimburse our General Partner and its affiliates for all expenses they incur and payments they make on our behalf. Our partnership agreement does not set a limit on the amount of expenses for which our General Partner and its affiliates may be reimbursed. These expenses include salary, bonus, incentive compensation and other amounts paid to persons who perform services for us or on our behalf and expenses allocated to our General Partner by its affiliates. Our partnership agreement provides that our General Partner determines the expenses that are allocable to us. The reimbursement of expenses and payment of fees, if any, to our General Partner and its affiliates will reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our unitholders.\nThe price of our common units may fluctuate significantly and unitholders could lose all or part of their investment.\nThe market price of our common units may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022 our quarterly distributions;\n\u2022 our quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022 announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts or acquisitions;\n\u2022 changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022 general economic conditions;\n\u2022 the failure of securities analysts to cover our common units or changes in financial estimates by analysts;\n\u2022 future sales of our common units; and\n\u2022 the other factors described in these \"Risk Factors.\"\nUnitholders may have liability to repay distributions.\nUnder certain circumstances, unitholders may have to repay amounts wrongfully returned or distributed to them. Under Section 17-607 of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, we may not make a distribution to our unitholders if the distribution would cause our liabilities to exceed the fair value of our assets. Delaware law provides that for a period of three years from the date of the impermissible distribution, limited partners who received the distribution and who knew at the time of the distribution that it violated Delaware law will be liable to the limited partnership for the distribution amount. Liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interests and liabilities that are non-recourse to the partnership are not counted for purposes of determining whether a distribution is permitted.\nFor as long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with certain disclosure requirements that apply to other public companies.\nFor as long as we remain an \"emerging growth company\" as defined in the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to provide an auditor's attestation report on management's assessment of the effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports. We will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, although we will lose that status earlier if we have more\nthan $1.0 billion of revenues in a fiscal year, have more than $700.0 million in market value of our common units held by non-affiliates, or issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period.\nTo the extent that we rely on any of the exemptions available to emerging growth companies, our unitholders will receive less information about our executive compensation and internal control over financial reporting than issuers that are not emerging growth companies. If some investors find our common units to be less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common units and our trading price may be more volatile.\nThe New York Stock Exchange (the \"NYSE\") does not require a publicly traded partnership like us to comply with certain of its corporate governance requirements.\nOur common units are listed on the NYSE. Because we are a publicly traded partnership, the NYSE does not require us to have a majority of independent directors on our General Partner's board of directors or to establish a compensation committee or a nominating and corporate governance committee. Accordingly, unitholders do not have the same protections afforded to certain corporations that are subject to all of the NYSE corporate governance requirements. Please read Part III, Item 10. \"Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance-Director Independence.\"\nTax Risks to Common Unitholders\nOur tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, as well as us not being subject to a material amount of entity-level taxation by individual states. If the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, were to treat us as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, or we become subject to entity-level taxation for state tax purposes, our cash available for distribution to our unitholders would be substantially reduced.\nThe anticipated after-tax economic benefit of an investment in our common units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.\nDespite the fact that we are organized as a limited partnership under Delaware law, we would be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes unless we satisfy a \"qualifying income\" requirement. Based upon our current operations, we believe we satisfy the qualifying income requirement. We have requested and obtained a favorable private letter ruling from the IRS to the effect that, based on facts presented in the private letter ruling request, our income from processing timber feedstocks into pellets and transporting, storing, marketing and distributing such timber feedstocks and wood pellets constitute \"qualifying income\" within the meaning of Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code. However, no ruling has been or will be requested regarding our treatment as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Failing to meet the qualifying income requirement or a change in current law could cause us to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject us to taxation as an entity.\nIf we were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we would pay U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income at the corporate tax rate, which is currently a maximum of 35%. Distributions to our unitholders would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions, and no income, gains, losses or deductions would flow through to our unitholders. Because a tax would be imposed upon us as a corporation, our cash available for distribution to our unitholders would be substantially reduced. Therefore, treatment of us as a corporation would result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after-tax return to the unitholders, likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of our common units.\nOur partnership agreement provides that if a law is enacted or existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that subjects us to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects us to\nentity-level taxation for U.S. federal, state, local or foreign income tax purposes, the minimum quarterly distribution amount and the target distribution amounts may be adjusted to reflect the impact of that law or interpretation on us. At the state level, several states have been evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity-level taxation through the imposition of state income, franchise or other forms of taxation. Specifically, we currently own assets and conduct business in Mississippi, North Carolina, Florida and Virginia, each of which imposes a margin or franchise tax. In the future, we may expand our operations. Imposition of a similar tax on us in other jurisdictions that we may expand to could substantially reduce our cash available for distribution to our unitholders.\nThe tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships or an investment in our units could be subject to potential legislative, judicial or administrative changes or differing interpretations, possibly applied on a retroactive basis.\nThe present U.S. federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships, including us, or an investment in our common units may be modified by administrative, legislative or judicial changes or differing interpretations at any time. For example, from time to time, members of Congress propose and consider substantive changes to the existing U.S. federal income tax laws that affect publicly traded partnerships. One such legislative proposal would have eliminated the qualifying income exception to the treatment of all publicly traded partnerships as corporations upon which we rely for our treatment as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A recent legislative proposal for comprehensive tax reform included a provision that would restrict the activities that generate qualifying income to exclude timber activities.\nIn addition, the IRS, on May 5, 2015, issued proposed regulations concerning which activities give rise to qualifying income within the meaning of Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code. We do not believe the proposed regulations affect our ability to qualify as a publicly traded partnership. However, finalized regulations could modify the amount of our gross income that we are able to treat as qualifying income for the purposes of the qualifying income requirement and modify or revoke existing private letter rulings, including ours.\nAny modification to the U.S. federal income tax laws may be applied retroactively and could make it more difficult or impossible for us to meet the exception for certain publicly traded partnerships to be treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We are unable to predict whether any of these changes or other proposals will ultimately be enacted. Any such changes could negatively impact the value of an investment in our common units.\nIf the IRS were to contest the federal income tax positions we take, it may adversely impact the market for our common units, and the costs of any such contest would reduce cash available for distribution to our unitholders. Recently enacted legislation alters the procedures for assessing and collecting taxes due for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, in a manner that could substantially reduce cash available for distribution to you.\nWe have requested and obtained a favorable private letter ruling from the IRS to the effect that, based on facts presented in the private letter ruling request, our income from processing timber feedstocks into pellets and transporting, storing, marketing and distributing such timber feedstocks and wood pellets will constitute \"qualifying income\" within the meaning of Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code. However, no ruling has been or will be requested regarding our treatment as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The IRS may adopt positions that differ from the positions we take in the future. It may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings to sustain some or all of the positions we take. A court may not agree with some or all of the positions we take. Any contest with the IRS may materially and adversely impact the market for our common units and the price at which they trade. Moreover, the costs of any contest between us and the IRS will\nresult in a reduction in cash available for distribution to our unitholders and thus will be borne indirectly by our unitholders.\nRecently enacted legislation applicable to us for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 alters the procedures for auditing large partnerships and also alters the procedures for assessing and collecting taxes due (including applicable penalties and interest) as a result of an audit. Unless we are eligible to (and choose to) elect to issue revised Schedules K-1 to our partners with respect to an audited and adjusted return, the IRS may assess and collect taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) directly from us in the year in which the audit is completed under the new rules. If we are required to pay taxes, penalties and interest as the result of audit adjustments, cash available for distribution to our unitholders may be substantially reduced. In addition, because payment would be due for the taxable year in which the audit is completed, unitholders during that taxable year would bear the expense of the adjustment even if they were not unitholders during the audited taxable year.\nEven if unitholders do not receive any cash distributions from us, unitholders will be required to pay taxes on their share of our taxable income.\nUnitholders are required to pay federal income taxes and, in some cases, state and local income taxes, on unitholders' share of our taxable income, whether or not they receive cash distributions from us. For example, if we sell assets and use the proceeds to repay existing debt or fund capital expenditures, you may be allocated taxable income and gain resulting from the sale, and our cash available for distribution would not increase. Similarly, taking advantage of opportunities to reduce our existing debt, such as debt exchanges, debt repurchases, or modifications of our existing debt could result in \"cancellation of indebtedness income\" being allocated to our unitholders as taxable income without any increase in our cash available for distribution. Unitholders may not receive cash distributions from us equal to their share of our taxable income or even equal to the actual tax due from them with respect to that income.\nA tax gain or loss on the disposition of our common units could be more or less than unitholders expect.\nIf unitholders sell their common units, they will recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and their tax basis in those common units. Because distributions in excess of unitholders' allocable share of our net taxable income decrease their tax basis in their common units, the amount, if any, of such prior excess distributions with respect to the units unitholders sell will, in effect, become taxable income to our unitholders if they sell such units at a price greater than their tax basis in those units, even if the price they receive is less than their original cost. Furthermore, a substantial portion of the amount realized, whether or not representing gain, may be taxed as ordinary income due to potential recapture items, including depreciation recapture. In addition, because the amount realized includes a unitholder's share of our nonrecourse liabilities, if they sell their units, unitholders may incur a tax liability in excess of the amount of cash they receive from the sale.\nTax-exempt entities and non-U.S. persons face unique tax issues from owning our common units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them.\nInvestment in common units by tax-exempt entities, such as employee benefit plans and individual retirement accounts (known as IRAs), and non-U.S. persons raises issues unique to them. For example, virtually all of our income allocated to organizations that are exempt from federal income tax, including IRAs and other retirement plans, will be unrelated business taxable income and will be taxable to them. Distributions to non-U.S. persons are subject to withholding taxes at the highest effective tax rate applicable to such non-U.S. persons, and each non-U.S. persons will be required to file United States federal tax returns and pay tax on their share of our taxable income. Any tax-exempt entity or non-U.S. person should consult their tax advisor before investing in our common units.\nWe treat each purchaser of our common units as having the same tax benefits without regard to the actual common units purchased. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could adversely affect the value of the common units.\nBecause we cannot match transferors and transferees of common units, we have adopted depreciation and amortization positions that may not conform to all aspects of existing Treasury Regulations. A successful IRS challenge to those positions could adversely affect the amount of tax benefits available to our unitholders. It also could affect the timing of these tax benefits or the amount of gain from our unitholders' sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of our common units or result in audit adjustments to their tax returns.\nWe prorate our items of income, gain, loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our units each month based upon the ownership of our units on the first day of each month, instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss and deduction among our unitholders.\nWe prorate our items of income, gain, loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our units each month based upon the ownership of our units on the first day of each month, instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred. The U.S. Department of the Treasury recently adopted final Treasury Regulations allowing a similar monthly simplifying convention for taxable years beginning on or after August 3, 2015. However, such regulations do not specifically authorize the use of the proration method we adopted for our 2015 taxable year and may not specifically authorize all aspects of our proration method thereafter. If the IRS were to challenge our proration method, we may be required to change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss and deduction among our unitholders.\nA unitholder whose units are the subject of a securities loan (e.g., a loan to a \"short seller\" to cover a short sale of units) may be considered as having disposed of those units. If so, he would no longer be treated for tax purposes as a partner with respect to those units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition.\nBecause there are no specific rules governing the U.S. federal income tax consequence of loaning a partnership interest, a unitholder whose units are the subject of a securities loan may be considered as having disposed of the loaned units. In that case, the unitholder may no longer be treated for tax purposes as a partner with respect to those units during the period of the loan to the short seller and the unitholder may recognize gain or loss from such disposition. Moreover, during the period of the loan, any of our income, gain, loss or deduction with respect to those units may not be reportable by the unitholder and any cash distributions received by the unitholder as to those units could be fully taxable as ordinary income. Unitholders desiring to assure their status as partners and avoid the risk of gain recognition from a securities loan are urged to modify any applicable brokerage account agreements to prohibit their brokers from borrowing their units.\nWe have adopted certain valuation methodologies in determining a unitholder's allocations of income, gain, loss and deduction. The IRS may challenge these methodologies or the resulting allocations, which could adversely affect the value of the common units.\nIn determining the items of income, gain, loss and deduction allocable to our unitholders, we must routinely determine the fair market value of our assets. Although we may, from time to time, consult with professional appraisers regarding valuation matters, we make many fair market value estimates using a methodology based on the market value of our common units as a means to measure the fair market value of our assets. The IRS may challenge these valuation methods and the resulting allocations of income, gain, loss and deduction.\nA successful IRS challenge to these methods or allocations could adversely affect the timing or amount of taxable income or loss being allocated to our unitholders. It also could affect the amount of gain from our unitholders' sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of the common units or result in audit adjustments to our unitholders' tax returns without the benefit of additional deductions.\nThe sale or exchange of 50% or more of our capital and profits interests during any twelve-month period will result in the termination of our partnership for federal income tax purposes.\nWe will be considered to have terminated our partnership for federal income tax purposes if there is a sale or exchange of 50% or more of the total interests in our capital and profits within a twelve-month period. As of March 1, 2016, our sponsor owned 53.5% of the total interests in our capital and profits. Therefore, a transfer by our sponsor of all or a portion of its interests in us could, in conjunction with the trading of common units held by the public, result in a termination of our partnership for federal income tax purposes. For purposes of determining whether the 50% threshold has been met, multiple sales of the same interest will be counted only once.\nOur termination would, among other things, result in the closing of our taxable year for all unitholders, which would result in us filing two tax returns for one calendar year and could result in a significant deferral of depreciation deductions allowable in computing our taxable income. In the case of a unitholder reporting on a taxable year other than a calendar year, the closing of our taxable year may also result in more than twelve months of our taxable income or loss being includable in taxable income for the unitholder's taxable year that includes our termination. Our termination would not affect our classification as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, but it would result in our being treated as a new partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes following the termination. If we were treated as a new partnership, we would be required to make new tax elections and could be subject to penalties if we were unable to determine that a termination occurred. The IRS has announced a relief procedure whereby if a publicly traded partnership that has technically terminated requests and the IRS grants special relief, among other things, the partnership may be permitted to provide only a single Schedule K-1 to unitholders for the two short tax periods included in the year in which the termination occurs.\nOur unitholders will likely be subject to state and local taxes and income tax return filing requirements in jurisdictions where they do not live as a result of investing in our common units.\nIn addition to U.S. federal income taxes, our unitholders may be subject to other taxes, including foreign, state and local taxes, unincorporated business taxes and estate, inheritance or intangible taxes that are imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we conduct business or own property now or in the future, even if they do not live in any of those jurisdictions. Our unitholders will likely be required to file foreign, state and local income tax returns and pay state and local income taxes in some or all of these various jurisdictions. Further, our unitholders may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with those requirements.\nWe currently own assets and conduct business in Mississippi, North Carolina, Florida and Virginia, each of which currently impose a personal income tax on individuals, corporations and other entities. As we make acquisitions or expand our business, we may own assets or conduct business in additional states that impose a personal income tax. It is our unitholders' responsibility to file all United States federal, foreign, state and local tax returns.", "PERMNO": 15313, "SIC": 2400, "TIC": "EVA"}
