Risk Factors\nIndex to Risk Factors\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacted us and, in the future, could again adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe onset of the COVID-19 pandemic created periods of significant economic disruption, high unemployment, volatility and disruption in financial markets and required adjustments in the housing finance system and real estate markets. Uncertainty regarding the pandemic\u2019s scope, severity and duration, and its resulting impact on the economy, continues to persist as the pandemic evolves, and it is difficult to predict the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.\nIn 2020, in response to the pandemic, among other things, we raised additional capital, aligned our business with the temporary origination and servicing guidelines announced by the GSEs, and activated our business continuity program by transitioning to a work-from-home virtual workforce model with the exception of certain essential activities. Further, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the economy, including the significant increase in unemployment and the implementation of mortgage forbearance programs by the GSEs, we experienced a material increase in new defaults in 2020 which resulted in a significant increase in our loss reserves and had a negative effect on our results of operations. If we experience another period of increased defaults stemming from the pandemic in future periods, our loss reserves may again increase which would negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may again impact our business in various ways, including the following, which are further described in the remainder of our risk factors in this report:\n\u25a0We may be required to maintain more capital against COVID-19-related defaults under the PMIERs, in which case Radian Group may choose or be required to contribute additional capital to Radian Guaranty to remain in compliance with the PMIERs financial requirements;\n\u25a0As a result of COVID-19-related relief programs, we anticipate that defaults related to the pandemic, if not cured, could remain in our defaulted loan inventory for a protracted period of time, potentially resulting in higher levels of claims and Claim Severity for those loans that ultimately result in a claim;\nGlossary\nPart I. Item 1A. Risk Factors\n\u25a0Our access to the reinsurance and capital markets may be limited and the terms on which we are able to access such markets may be negatively impacted;\n\u25a0The GSEs\u2019 business practices have changed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the primary objectives of supporting borrowers impacted by the pandemic and protecting the ongoing functioning of the housing finance system. In response to the ongoing pandemic, the FHFA and GSEs are likely to continue to take actions that impact the housing finance system. Because traditional mortgage insurance is an important component of this system, these actions have had, and may continue to have, a significant impact on our mortgage insurance operations and performance; and\n\u25a0Volatility in the financial markets may impact the performance of our investment portfolio and could increase the risk that we will not achieve our investment objectives.\nAlthough we are uncertain of the ultimate magnitude or duration of the business and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, their long-term effect on our businesses will depend on, among other things: the extent, evolution and duration of the pandemic; the severity of and the number of people infected with the virus and the widespread availability of anti-viral treatments and vaccines, especially as new strains of COVID-19 have been discovered; the wider economic effects of the pandemic and the scope and duration of governmental and other third-party measures restricting day-to-day life and business operations; the impact of economic stimulus efforts to support the economy through the pandemic; and governmental and GSE programs implemented to assist borrowers experiencing a COVID-19-related hardship, including forbearance programs. Due to the unprecedented and continually evolving social and economic impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic on the U.S. and global economies generally, and in particular on the U.S. housing, real estate and housing finance markets, there is significant uncertainty regarding the ultimate impact on our business, business prospects, operating results and financial condition and our estimates or predictions regarding such impact may be materially wrong.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Matters\nRadian Guaranty may fail to maintain its eligibility status with the GSEs, and the additional capital required to support Radian Guaranty\u2019s eligibility could reduce our available liquidity.\nIn order to be eligible to insure loans purchased by the GSEs, mortgage insurers such as Radian Guaranty must meet the GSEs\u2019 eligibility requirements, or PMIERs. The PMIERs are comprehensive, covering virtually all aspects of the business of a private mortgage insurer, including internal risk management and quality controls, the relationship between the GSEs and the approved insurer and the approved insurer\u2019s financial condition. In addition, the PMIERs contain requirements related to the operations of our mortgage insurance business, including extensive operational requirements in areas such as claim processing, loss mitigation, document retention, underwriting, quality control, reporting and monitoring, among others. These extensive operational requirements have resulted in additional expenses and require substantial time and effort from management and our employees. If Radian Guaranty is unable to satisfy the requirements set forth in the PMIERs, including the financial requirements discussed below, the GSEs could restrict it from conducting certain types of business with them or take actions that may include not purchasing loans insured by Radian Guaranty.\nThe PMIERs include financial requirements incorporating a risk-based framework that requires a mortgage insurer\u2019s Available Assets to meet or exceed its Minimum Required Assets. The PMIERs financial requirements include increased financial requirements for defaulted loans, as well as for performing loans with a higher likelihood of default and/or certain credit characteristics, such as higher LTVs and lower FICO credit scores. Radian Guaranty\u2019s ability to continue to comply with the PMIERs financial requirements could be impacted by, among other factors: (i) the volume and product mix of our NIW; (ii) factors affecting the performance of our mortgage insurance portfolio, including the level of new defaults and prepayments; (iii) for existing defaults, the aging of these existing defaults and whether they are subject to, and remain in, mortgage forbearance programs, and the ultimate losses we incur on new or existing defaults; (iv) the application of the Disaster Related Capital Charge (as discussed below) under the PMIERs; (v) the amount of credit that we receive under the PMIERs financial requirements for our third-party reinsurance transactions (which is subject to initial and ongoing review by the GSEs); and (vi) potential amendments or updates to the PMIERs. If our mix of business includes more loans that are subject to the increased financial requirements under the PMIERs, we may limit the type and volume of business we are willing to write for certain of our products based on the increased financial requirements associated with certain loans. This could reduce the amount of NIW we write, which could reduce our future revenues.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the economy beginning in March 2020, we experienced a material increase in new defaults in 2020, substantially all of which related to defaults of loans subject to mortgage forbearance programs implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The overall volume of pandemic-related new defaults resulted in a corresponding significant increase in Radian Guaranty\u2019s Minimum Required Assets, which negatively impacted Radian Guaranty\u2019s PMIERs Cushion beginning in 2020. Since then, Radian Guaranty\u2019s Minimum Required Assets have been decreasing as the economy has been recovering, the rate of new defaults has largely returned to pre-pandemic levels and many pandemic-related defaulted loans have cured. However, Radian\u2019s Minimum Required Assets remain elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels and the amount of Minimum Required Assets that Radian Guaranty is and will be required to maintain, will depend on the number, timing and duration of defaults, including those defaulted loans participating in mortgage forbearance programs. This, in turn, will depend on the scope, severity, evolution and duration of the pandemic, its resulting impact on the economy, including unemployment and housing prices, and the effectiveness of current and any future\nGlossary\nPart I. Item 1A. Risk Factors\ngovernment and GSE programs to provide economic and individual relief and long-term assistance to homeowners, all of which will likely have an impact on the ability of borrowers to remain current on their mortgage payments and, if they have entered into forbearance or other relief programs, to resume making payments upon the expiration of the forbearance period. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Regulation-Federal Regulation-CARES Act\u201d and \u201cItem 1. Business-Regulation-Federal Regulation-GSE Requirements for Mortgage Insurance Eligibility\u201d for information regarding forbearance programs for borrowers experiencing financial hardship related to the pandemic.\nThe PMIERs apply a 0.30 multiplier to the Minimum Required Asset factor for loans that have become non-performing as a result of a \u201cFEMA Declared Major Disaster\u201d event, including as a result of participation in a mortgage forbearance program. This effectively reduces the Minimum Required Asset amount for these loans by 70%. Under National Emergency Guidelines issued by the GSEs, the PMIERs were amended so that the Disaster Related Capital Charge applies nationwide to all non-performing loans that are subject to a COVID-19 forbearance plan. For more information about the application of the Disaster Related Capital Charge see \u201cItem 1. Business-Regulation-Federal Regulation-GSE Requirements for Mortgage Insurance Eligibility.\u201d\nThe application of the Disaster Related Capital Charge has materially reduced the total amount of Minimum Required Assets that Radian Guaranty is required to hold against COVID-19 Defaulted Loans. While we expect that application of the Disaster Related Capital Charge will continue to materially reduce Radian Guaranty\u2019s Minimum Required Assets for loans subject to a COVID-19 forbearance plan, the benefit that Radian Guaranty currently is receiving from the Disaster Related Capital Charge is expected to diminish over time. The reduction of this benefit could be accelerated if the GSEs were to terminate the COVID-19 Amendment to the PMIERs issued under their National Emergency Guidelines.\nAs the benefits of the Disaster Related Capital Charge diminish, or if existing and future new defaults materially increase Radian Guaranty\u2019s Minimum Required Assets, we may be required or otherwise choose to: (i) contribute capital to Radian Guaranty; (ii) alter our strategy with respect to our NIW; or (iii) seek additional capital relief through reinsurance or otherwise, which may not be available on acceptable terms or on terms that would be approved by the GSEs.\nThe GSEs may amend the PMIERs at any time and also have broad discretion to interpret the PMIERs, which could impact the calculation of Radian Guaranty\u2019s Available Assets and/or Minimum Required Assets. The most recent large-scale revisions to PMIERs, or PMIERs 2.0, became effective on March 31, 2019 and the PMIERs were further updated as part of the COVID-19 Amendment under the National Emergency Guidelines. We expect the GSEs to continue to update the PMIERs in the future, including potentially to align the PMIERs 2.0 financial requirements with the increased capital requirements for the GSEs under the ECF and/or the proposed new liquidity requirements for the GSEs. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Regulation-Federal Regulation-GSE Requirements for Mortgage Insurance Eligibility\u201d and \u201cItem 1. Business-Regulation-Federal Regulation-Housing Finance Reform and the GSEs\u2019 Business Practices\u201d for additional information on the ECF and proposed GSE liquidity requirements.\nCompliance with the PMIERs financial requirements could impact our holding company liquidity if additional capital support for Radian Guaranty is required for it to maintain this compliance. The amount of capital that Radian Group could be required to contribute to Radian Guaranty for this purpose is uncertain, but could be significant and, under extreme economic scenarios, could exhaust Radian Group\u2019s available liquidity. See \u201c-Radian Group\u2019s sources of liquidity may be insufficient to fund its obligations.\u201d Further, if Radian Guaranty becomes capital constrained, it may be more difficult for Radian Guaranty to return capital to Radian Group, which would compound the negative liquidity impact to Radian Group of the contributions it may be required to make to Radian Guaranty and leave less liquidity to satisfy Radian Group\u2019s other obligations. Depending on the amount of liquidity that is utilized from Radian Group, we may be required (or may decide) to seek additional capital by incurring additional debt, issuing additional equity or selling assets, which we may not be able to do on favorable terms, if at all.\nThe PMIERs prohibit Radian Guaranty from engaging in certain activities such as insuring loans originated or serviced by an affiliate (except under certain circumstances) and require Radian Guaranty to obtain the prior consent of the GSEs before taking many actions, which may include, among other things, entering into certain intercompany agreements, settling loss mitigation disputes with customers and commuting risk. These restrictions could prohibit or delay Radian Guaranty from taking certain actions that would be advantageous to it or to Radian Group.\nAlthough we expect Radian Guaranty to retain its eligibility status with the GSEs and to continue to comply with the PMIERs financial requirements, including as potentially updated in the future, we cannot provide assurance that this will occur. Loss of Radian Guaranty\u2019s eligibility status with the GSEs would have an immediate and material adverse impact on the franchise value of our Mortgage business and our future prospects, as well as a material negative impact on our future results of operations and financial condition.\nOur insurance subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive state insurance regulations and other requirements, which we may fail to satisfy.\nWe and our insurance subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive, detailed regulation by the insurance regulators in the states where they are domiciled or licensed to transact business. These regulations are principally designed for the protection of our insurance policyholders rather than for the benefit of our investors. Insurance laws vary from state to state, but generally grant broad supervisory powers to examine insurance companies and enforce rules or exercise discretion affecting almost\nGlossary\nPart I. Item 1A. Risk Factors\nevery significant aspect of the insurance business, including the power to revoke or restrict an insurance company\u2019s ability to write new business.\nAmong other matters, the state insurance regulators impose various capital requirements on our insurance subsidiaries. State insurance capital requirements for our mortgage insurance subsidiaries include Risk-to-capital ratios, other risk-based capital measures and surplus requirements that may limit the amount of insurance that our mortgage insurance subsidiaries write or the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to distribute capital to Radian Group. Similarly, our title insurance subsidiary is required to maintain statutory premium reserves that vary by state and are subject to periodic reviews of certain financial performance ratios, the results of which could result in additional capital requirements in states where it is licensed. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Regulation-State Regulation\u201d for more information on existing regulatory requirements and potential changes to the capital and surplus requirements under the Model Act that the NAIC has been reviewing for many years.\nAmong other things, our failure to maintain adequate levels of capital in our mortgage insurance and title insurance subsidiaries could lead to intervention by the various insurance regulatory authorities, which could materially and adversely affect our business, business prospects and financial condition. In addition, the GSEs and our mortgage lending customers may decide not to conduct new business with Radian Guaranty (or may reduce current business levels) or impose restrictions on Radian Guaranty if it is not in compliance with applicable state insurance requirements. The franchise value of our mortgage insurance business likely would be significantly diminished if we were prohibited from writing new business or restricted in the amount of new business we could write in one or more states. For additional information about statutory surplus and other state insurance requirements, see \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Mortgage,\u201d as well as Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe mortgage insurance industry has always been highly competitive with respect to pricing. Our mortgage insurance subsidiaries\u2019 premium rates and policy forms are generally subject to regulation in every state in which they are licensed to transact business. These regulations are intended to protect policyholders against the adverse effects of excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory rates and to encourage fair competition in the insurance marketplace. We may be subject to regulatory inquiries or examinations with respect to our mortgage insurance premium rates and policy forms. Similarly, our title insurance business is subject to extensive rate regulation by the applicable state agencies in the states in which it operates. Given that the premium rates for our insurance subsidiaries are highly regulated, we could lose business opportunities and fail to successfully implement our business strategies if our rates are deemed non-compliant or are subject to investigation, if new rates and policy forms are not approved as may be required, or if we are otherwise unable to respond to competitor pricing actions and our customers\u2019 demands in a timely and compliant manner.\nChanges in the charters, business practices or role of the GSEs in the U.S. housing market generally, could significantly impact our businesses.\nOur current business structure is highly dependent on the GSEs, as the GSEs are the primary beneficiaries of most of our mortgage insurance policies. Changes in the business practices of the GSEs, which can be implemented by the GSEs acting independently or through their conservator, the FHFA, could negatively impact our businesses and financial performance. Examples of potential changes that could impact our business, may include, without limitation:\n\u25a0eligibility requirements for a mortgage insurer to become and remain an approved eligible insurer for the GSEs;\n\u25a0underwriting standards on mortgages they purchase;\n\u25a0policies or requirements that may result in a reduction in the number of mortgages they acquire;\n\u25a0the national conforming loan limit for mortgages they acquire;\n\u25a0the level of mortgage insurance they require;\n\u25a0the terms on which mortgage insurance coverage may be canceled before reaching the cancellation thresholds established by law;\n\u25a0the terms required to be included in master policies for the mortgage insurance policies that cover the loans they acquire, including limitations on our ability to mitigate losses on insured mortgages that are in default;\n\u25a0the amount of loan level price adjustments or guarantee fees, which often result in a higher cost to borrowers, that the GSEs charge on loans that require mortgage insurance; and\n\u25a0the degree of influence that the GSEs have over a mortgage lender\u2019s selection of the mortgage insurer providing coverage.\nIn addition, the GSEs\u2019 business practices have changed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily to support borrowers impacted by the pandemic and protect the ongoing functioning of the housing finance system. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, the actions or potential inactions of the FHFA and GSEs in response to COVID-19 may continue to have a significant impact on the overall functioning of the housing finance system. Because traditional mortgage insurance is an important component of this system and because our businesses depend on the health of the housing finance\nGlossary\nPart I. Item 1A. Risk Factors\nsystem and housing markets in particular, these actions have impacted, and may continue to impact, our business operations and performance.\nThe structure of the residential housing finance system could be altered in the future, including as a result of comprehensive housing reform legislation. Since the FHFA was appointed as conservator of the GSEs, there has been a wide range of legislative proposals to reform the U.S. housing finance market. In conjunction with these proposals, there has been ongoing debate about the roles that the federal government and private capital should play in the housing finance system. To the extent new legislative action alters the existing GSE charters without explicit preservation of the role of private mortgage insurance for high-LTV loans, our business could be adversely affected. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Regulation-Federal Regulation-Housing Finance Reform and the GSEs\u2019 Business Practices\u201d for a discussion of the future of housing finance in the U.S., including potential objectives for future reform.\nIn December 2020, the FHFA finalized the ECF, which establishes new increased capital requirements for the GSEs, and the FHFA also has proposed new liquidity requirements for the GSEs. In September 2021, the FHFA proposed further amendments to the ECF, and it is uncertain if and when these proposed amendments may be incorporated into the ECF and the form that they may take. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Regulation-Federal Regulation-Housing Finance Reform and the GSEs\u2019 Business Practices\u201d for further information about the requirements established by the ECF, the September 2021 proposed amendments to the ECF and the proposed new liquidity requirements for the GSEs. Taken together, compliance with the increased capital requirements imposed by the ECF and the proposed new GSE liquidity requirements could significantly alter the business practices and operations of the GSEs, including potentially resulting in an increase in GSE pricing and a decrease in their use of credit risk transfer. An increase in GSE pricing could make alternatives to the GSEs such as FHA insured loans or the private securitization market more attractive, which could reduce the GSEs\u2019 market position and reduce the number of loans available for private mortgage insurance. Further, the GSEs may seek to amend the PMIERs financial requirements in the future, including potentially to align with the ECF and the GSE liquidity requirements, once finalized. It remains uncertain if, when and how the PMIERs ultimately may be amended; however, changes to the PMIERs to align with the ECF could include: (i) an increase in the level of Radian Guaranty\u2019s required capital and (ii) a decrease in the amount of PMIERs\u2019 capital relief that Radian Guaranty receives for existing or future reinsurance or insurance-linked notes transactions.\nThe GSEs have in the past and may in the future pursue new products and activities in pursuit of their business strategies, including credit risk transfer transactions and structures that compete with private mortgage insurance. In 2018, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae launched pilot programs, IMAGIN and EPMI, respectively, as alternative ways for lenders to obtain credit enhancement and sell loans with LTVs greater than 80% to the GSEs. These programs were discontinued in 2021, but could be relaunched in the future. If these programs or any future credit risk transfer transactions and structures were to materially displace primary loan level or standard levels of mortgage insurance, the amount of mortgage insurance we write may be reduced, which could negatively impact our franchise value, results of operations and financial condition. The FHFA previously released for comment a proposed rule regarding the process for how it will consider and approve new GSE activities and products; however, this proposed rule has not been finalized. In addition, the proposed rule is intended to apply to any future pilot programs, and therefore, it is not certain whether the same standards and procedures proposed in the new rule also would apply to pilots such as IMAGIN and EPMI if they are relaunched in the future. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Regulation-Federal Regulation-Housing Finance Reform and the GSEs\u2019 Business Practices\u201d for further discussion of IMAGIN and EPMI and additional information about the proposed rule discussed above.\nSince assuming leadership over the FHFA in June 2021, the Biden Administration appointed FHFA leadership has taken actions that represent a reversal of the previous FHFA leadership\u2019s primary focus on preparing the GSEs to exit from conservatorship by increasing the GSEs\u2019 overall capital levels and reducing their credit risk profile. In contrast, the current FHFA leadership has been focused on increasing the accessibility and affordability of mortgage credit, in particular to low- and moderate-income borrowers and underserved communities. Radian Guaranty and other private mortgage insurance companies have been engaged in discussions with the GSEs regarding how the industry may support the GSEs to advance these objectives. In addition, in furtherance of these policy objectives, Radian Guaranty and/or one or more of the mortgage insurers may pursue initiatives outside of their customary business activities, the success of which may be measured based on how well the initiative was able to advance accessibility and affordability of mortgage credit rather than by traditional profitability and return measures. In addition, the FHFA has required the GSEs to prepare and file three-year Equitable Housing Finance Plans that describe each GSE\u2019s planned efforts to advance equity in housing finance. The action plans, when finalized, may include methods to reduce mortgage costs for historically underserved borrowers, including mortgage insurance costs. To implement these plans or to otherwise support the FHFA\u2019s mandate regarding increasing the accessibility and affordability of mortgage credit, the GSEs may pursue new products and activities, or alter existing policies and practices in ways that could require changes to the GSEs\u2019 business practices, including in ways that could negatively impact Radian Guaranty\u2019s IIF, results of operations or financial condition.\nAlthough we believe that traditional private mortgage insurance will continue to play an important role in any future housing finance structure, developments in the practices of the GSEs, including potentially new federal legislation, changes to existing statutes, rules or regulations, or changes in the GSEs\u2019 business practices that reduce the level of private mortgage insurance coverage used by the GSEs as credit enhancement, or even eliminate the requirement, may diminish the franchise value of our mortgage insurance business and materially and adversely affect our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nGlossary\nPart I. Item 1A. Risk Factors\nLegislation and administrative and regulatory changes and interpretations could impact our businesses.\nOur businesses are subject to and may be impacted by many federal and state lending, insurance and consumer laws and regulations. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Regulation\u201d for a discussion of significant state and federal regulations and other requirements of the GSEs that are applicable to our businesses. Changes in these laws and regulations or the way they are interpreted or applied, as well as changes in other laws and regulations that may affect corporations more generally, could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and business prospects. In addition, our businesses could be impacted by new legislation or regulations, including changes that are not currently contemplated and which could occur at any time. While we have established policies and procedures to comply with applicable laws and regulations, many such laws and regulations are complex, and it is not possible to predict the eventual scope, duration or outcome of any reviews or investigations nor is it possible to predict their effect on us or the industries in which we participate.\nRisks Related to our Mortgage and homegenius Business Operations\nOur success depends on our ability to assess and manage our underwriting risks; the premiums we charge may not be adequate to compensate us for our liability for losses and the amount of capital we are required to hold against our insured risks. We expect to incur losses for future defaults beyond what we have reserved for in our financial statements.\nThe estimates and expectations we use to establish premium rates in our mortgage insurance business are based on assumptions made at the time our insurance is written. Our mortgage insurance premium rates are based on, among other items, our expectations about competitive and economic conditions and our cost of capital, as well as a broad range of other factors and risk attributes that we consider in developing our assumptions about the credit performance of the loans we insure and the economic benefits we expect to receive from our insurance policies. Our assumptions may ultimately prove to be inaccurate, especially in a period of high market volatility and economic uncertainty, or if there is a change in law or the GSEs\u2019 business practices that alter the performance of the loans we have insured in ways that are inconsistent with our assumptions, including the amount of premium we expect to receive from such insurance. The risk of inaccurate or unreliable data may have an adverse impact on our ability to effectively perform critical business operations, such as servicing, loss management, external reporting or data-driven internal analysis. The premium structure we apply is subject to approval by state regulatory agencies, which can delay or limit our ability to increase our premiums if further filings or approvals are necessary to institute pricing adjustments.\nIf the risk underlying a mortgage loan that we have insured develops more adversely than we anticipated, we generally cannot increase the premium rates on this in-force business, or cancel coverage or elect not to renew coverage, to mitigate the effects of such adverse developments. Similarly, we cannot adjust our premiums if the amount of capital we are required to hold against our insured risks increases from the amount we were required to hold at the time a policy was written or if the premiums we expected to receive from such insurance are less than anticipated due to a change in the GSEs\u2019 business practices or otherwise. As a result, if we are unable to compensate for or offset the increased capital requirements in other ways, the returns on our business may be lower than we assumed or expected. Our premiums earned and the associated investment income on those premiums may ultimately prove to be inadequate to compensate for the losses that we may incur and may not provide an adequate return on increased capital that may be required. As a result, our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted.\nAdditionally, in accordance with industry practice, we do not establish reserves in our mortgage insurance business until we are notified that a borrower has failed to make at least two monthly payments when due. Because our mortgage insurance reserving does not account for the impact of future losses that we expect to incur with respect to performing (non-defaulted) loans, our obligation for ultimate losses that we expect to incur at any period end is not reflected in our financial statements, except if a premium deficiency exists. A premium deficiency reserve would be recorded if the present value of expected future losses and expenses exceeds the present value of expected future premiums and already established loss reserves on the applicable loans. As future defaults are not currently reflected in our mortgage insurance loss reserves, our loss reserves could increase significantly in future periods if we experience a high volume of new defaults in future periods, which would negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf the estimates we use in establishing loss reserves are incorrect, we may be required to take unexpected charges to income, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe establish loss reserves in our mortgage insurance business to provide for the estimated cost of future claims on defaulted loans. Setting our loss reserves requires significant judgment by management with respect to the likelihood, magnitude and timing of each potential loss, including an estimate of the impact of our Loss Mitigation Activities with respect to defaulted loans. The models, assumptions and estimates we use to establish loss reserves may not prove to be accurate, especially in the event of an extended economic downturn or a period of market volatility and economic uncertainty, such as we have experienced due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Because of this, claims paid may be substantially different than our loss reserves and these reserves may be insufficient to satisfy the full amount of claims that we ultimately have to pay. Changes to our loss reserve estimates could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, although the rate of new defaults has largely returned to pre-pandemic levels and many pandemic-related defaulted loans have cured,\nGlossary\nPart I. Item 1A. Risk Factors\nmany defaulted loans in our insured portfolio remain in COVID-19 mortgage forbearance programs that are expected to expire in the near future. Forbearance for federally-insured mortgages (including those delivered to or purchased by the GSEs) allows for mortgage payments to be suspended for up to 18 months, subject to certain limitations such as when the forbearance plan was initiated. Historically, forbearance plans have reduced the frequency of our losses on affected loans. However, given the uncertainty regarding the long-term economic impact of COVID-19, it is difficult to predict the likelihood of default on loans that remain in COVID-19 related forbearance. Whether a defaulted loan will cure, including through modification, when forbearance ends will depend on the economic circumstances of the borrower at that time. The GSEs have introduced specific loan workout options for borrowers whose COVID-19 forbearance plans end. If a servicer is unable to contact a borrower to determine a loan workout option, the forbearance plan will end and the loan may remain in default. If a greater number of defaulted loans in COVID-19 forbearance programs ultimately result in claims than we anticipate, we may be required to increase our loss reserves.\nWe anticipate that defaults related to the pandemic, if not cured, could remain in our defaulted loan inventory for a protracted period of time, resulting in a higher likelihood of claim and higher levels of Claim Severity for those loans that ultimately result in a claim. See \u201c-An extension in the period of time that a loan remains in our defaulted loan inventory may increase the severity of claims that we ultimately are required to pay.\u201d\nA portion of the defaulted loans in our portfolio originated in the years prior to and including 2008 have been in default for an extended period of time. While these loans are generally assigned a higher loss reserve based on our belief that they are more likely to result in a claim, we also assume, based on historical trends, that a significant portion of these loans will cure or otherwise not result in a claim. Given the significant period of time that these loans have been in default, it is possible that the ultimate cure rate for these defaulted loans will be less than our current estimates of Cures for this inventory of defaults.\nIf our loss reserve estimates are inadequate, we may be required to increase our reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur Loss Mitigation Activity is not expected to mitigate mortgage insurance losses to the same extent as in prior years; Loss Mitigation Activity could continue to negatively impact our customer relationships.\nAs part of our claims management process we pursue opportunities to mitigate losses both before and after we receive claims, including processes to ensure claims are valid. Following the financial crisis, our Loss Mitigation Activities, such as Rescissions, Claim Denials and Claim Curtailments, increased significantly in response to the poor underwriting, servicer negligence and other instances of non-compliance with our insurance policies that was prevalent in the period leading up to the financial crisis. These Loss Mitigation Activities materially mitigated our paid losses for loans originated and serviced during this period and resulted in a significant reduction in our loss reserves. Following the financial crisis, mortgage underwriting and servicing have generally improved, and the amount of Loss Mitigation Activity required with respect to the claims on loans originated and serviced in more recent periods has significantly decreased. As a result, our future Loss Mitigation Activity is not expected to mitigate our paid losses to the same extent as it did in the years following the financial crisis. In addition, we have incorporated provisions into our 2014 Master Policy and 2020 Master Policy that generally provide rescission relief based on the number of months that borrowers remain current on their mortgage loans, and Radian Guaranty has entered into a Factored Claim Administration Agreement with Fannie Mae for certain loans that predetermines the amount of covered expenses forming part of a loss using prenegotiated expense factors. As a consequence, our rights to conduct Loss Mitigation Activity generally are more limited for loans covered by more recent Master Policies and for more recent defaults as compared to the past.\nOur Loss Mitigation Activities and claims paying practices have resulted in disputes with certain of our customers and in some cases, damaged our relationships with customers, resulting in a loss of business. While we have resolved all material disputes, a risk remains that our Loss Mitigation Activities or claims paying practices could continue to have a negative impact on our relationships with customers or potential customers. Further, disputes with our customers that are not resolved could result in additional arbitration or judicial proceedings, requiring significant legal expenses. To the extent that past or future Loss Mitigation Activities or claims paying practices impact our customer relationships, our competitive position could be adversely affected, resulting in the potential loss of business and impacting our results of operations.\nReinsurance may not be available, affordable or adequate to protect us against losses.\nWe use reinsurance as a capital and risk management tool. We have distributed risk through third-party quota share and excess-of-loss reinsurance arrangements, as well as through the capital markets using mortgage insurance-linked notes transactions.\nThe availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to market conditions beyond our control, including factors that impact the demand of investors for mortgage credit. No assurance can be given that reinsurance will remain available to us in amounts that we consider sufficient and at rates and upon terms that we consider acceptable. Accordingly, we may be forced to incur additional expenses for reinsurance or may not be able to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable terms, which could cause us to increase the amount of risk we retain, negatively affect the returns we are able to achieve on the business we write and adversely affect our ability to write future business. Further, reinsurance does not relieve us of our direct liability to policyholders, therefore, if the reinsurer is unable or unwilling to meet its obligations to us, we remain liable to make claims\nGlossary\nPart I. Item 1A. Risk Factors\npayments to our policyholders. As a result, our reinsurance arrangements do not fully eliminate our obligation to pay claims, and we have assumed counterparty credit risk with respect to our inability to recover amounts due from reinsurers.\nWe use reinsurance to manage Radian Guaranty\u2019s capital position under the PMIERs financial requirements. Among other benefits, our risk distribution transactions reduce our required capital, including by significantly reducing our Required Minimum Assets under the PMIERs. The initial and ongoing credit that we receive under the PMIERs financial requirements for these risk distribution transactions is subject to the periodic review of the GSEs and could be influenced by the ECF, which, in the form finalized in December 2020, significantly increases the capital requirements for the GSEs and provides the GSEs with a reduced amount of credit for their own credit risk transfer activities. Although the FHFA has since proposed further amendments to the ECF in September 2021, including to provide more credit for risk transfer transactions, it is uncertain if and when these proposed amendments may be incorporated into the ECF and the form that they may ultimately take. See \u201c-Changes in the charters, business practices or role of the GSEs in the U.S. housing market generally, could significantly impact our businesses.\u201d If the GSEs revise the PMIERs in the future to align with a form of the ECF that provides less capital relief for credit risk transfer transactions, such alignment could reduce the credit that Radian Guaranty receives for reinsurance under the PMIERs, which could negatively impact our strategic approach to risk management and risk distribution.\nIf we are unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable terms or to collect amounts due from our reinsurers, or if we receive less PMIERs capital relief for our reinsurance transactions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAn extension in the period of time that a loan remains in our defaulted loan inventory may increase the severity of claims that we ultimately are required to pay.\nHigh levels of defaults and corresponding delays in foreclosures could delay our receipt of claims, resulting in an increase in the period of time that a loan remains in our defaulted loan inventory, and as a result, the Claim Severity. Generally, foreclosure delays do not stop the accrual of interest or affect other expenses on a loan, and unless a loan is cured during such delay, once title to the property ultimately is obtained and a claim is filed, our paid claim amount may include additional interest and expenses, increasing the Claim Severity.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous federal and state regulatory agencies have instituted borrower relief programs, including mortgage payment forbearance and foreclosure and eviction moratoriums, with the objective of supporting borrowers through the economic hardship resulting from the pandemic and allowing borrowers to remain in their homes. After being extended multiple times, the foreclosure and eviction moratoriums have now expired; however, the existence of these moratoriums significantly impacted the claims process in 2020 and 2021 by preventing the procedural steps necessary for the filing of a claim under our insurance policies. Further, when loans subject to COVID-19 mortgage forbearance programs reach the end of their forbearance period, federal law requires servicers to discuss forbearance and loss mitigation options with their borrowers and afford additional protections to borrowers before their loans are referred to foreclosure, which further extends the period in which these loans remain in defaulted status. As a result of COVID-19-related relief programs, defaults related to the pandemic, if not cured, may remain in our defaulted loan inventory for a protracted period of time, which could result in higher levels of Claim Severity for those loans that ultimately result in a claim. Higher levels of Claim Severity would increase our incurred losses and could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf the length of time that our mortgage insurance policies remain in force declines, it could result in a decrease in our future revenues.\nMost of our primary IIF consists of policies for which we expect to receive premiums in the future, typically through Monthly Premium Policies, and as a result, a significant portion of our earned premiums are derived from insurance that was written in prior years, often with premium rates that are greater than those prevailing in the market today. The length of time that this insurance remains in force, which we refer to as the Persistency Rate, is a significant driver of our future revenues, with a lower overall Persistency Rate generally reducing our future revenues. As a result, the ultimate profitability of our mortgage insurance business is affected by the impact of mortgage prepayment speeds on the mix of business we write.\nPrevailing mortgage interest rates compared to the mortgage rates on our IIF and the level of home price appreciation occurring since origination of the loan affect the incentive for borrowers to refinance and therefore our Persistency Rate, with lower current interest rates and a greater level of home price appreciation making it more attractive for borrowers to refinance. Borrowers with significant equity may be able to refinance their loans without requiring mortgage insurance. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the government stimulus efforts in response to the pandemic, has resulted in a historically low interest rate environment, which in combination with the significant level of home price appreciation that has occurred over recent years, has led to elevated policy cancellations associated with a high level of refinance activity. The increase in policy cancellations associated with this high level of refinance activity has reduced our Persistency Rate compared to historic levels, and in turn, limited the growth of our IIF, which is one of the primary drivers of future premiums that we expect to earn over time. If the length of time that our mortgage insurance policies remain in force continues to remain low for a protracted period of time or further declines, and such decline is not offset by a sufficient level of NIW, it could result in a further decrease in our future revenues, particularly from our Recurring Premium Policies.\nGlossary\nPart I. Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOther factors affecting the length of time that our insurance remains in force include:\n\u25a0the HPA requirement that servicers cancel mortgage insurance when a borrower\u2019s LTV ratio meets or is scheduled to meet certain levels, generally based on the original value of the home and subject to various conditions;\n\u25a0the GSEs\u2019 mortgage insurance cancellation guidelines, which apply more broadly than the HPA, and also consider a home\u2019s current value. For example, borrowers may request cancellation of mortgage insurance based on the home\u2019s current value if certain LTV and seasoning requirements are met and the borrowers have an acceptable payment history. For loans seasoned between two and five years, the LTV ratio must be 75% or less, and for loans seasoned more than five years, the LTV ratio must be 80% or less. For more information about the GSEs\u2019 guidelines and business practices and how they may change, see \u201c-Changes in the charters, business practices or role of the GSEs in the U.S. housing market generally, could significantly impact our businesses.\u201d\n\u25a0the credit policies of certain lenders, which may make it more difficult for homeowners to refinance loans; and\n\u25a0economic conditions that can affect a borrower\u2019s decision to pay off a mortgage earlier than required, including the strength of the housing market, which impacts a borrower\u2019s prospects for selling their existing home and finding a suitable and affordable new home.\nIf these or other factors cause a decrease in the length of time that our Recurring Premium Policies, for which we expect to receive premiums in the future, remain in force, our future revenues could be negatively impacted, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur delegated underwriting program may subject our mortgage insurance business to unanticipated claims.\nIn our mortgage insurance business, we permit lenders to obtain mortgage insurance for residential mortgage loans originated and underwritten by them using Radian\u2019s pre-established underwriting guidelines. Once we accept a lender into our delegated underwriting program, we generally insure a mortgage loan originated by that lender based on our expectation that the lender has followed our specified underwriting guidelines. Under this program, a lender could commit us to insure a material number of loans with unacceptable risk profiles before we discover the problem and are able to terminate that lender\u2019s delegated underwriting authority or pursue other rights that may be available to us, such as our rights to rescind coverage or deny claims.\nOur mortgage insurance business faces intense competition.\nThe U.S. mortgage insurance industry is highly competitive. Our competitors primarily include other private mortgage insurers and governmental agencies, principally the FHA and VA.\nWe currently compete with other private mortgage insurers that are eligible to write business for the GSEs primarily on the basis of price, underwriting guidelines, overall service, customer relationships, perceived financial strength (including comparative credit ratings) and reputation. Overall service competition is based on, among other things, effective and timely delivery of products, responsiveness to compliance audits, timeliness of claims payments, customer service, timely and accurate administration of policies, training, loss mitigation efforts and management and field service expertise. We also believe that our service proposition to customers includes our ability to offer services to customers through our homegenius business that are relevant to our mortgage insurance customers and complement our mortgage insurance products. For more information about our competitive environment, including pricing competition, see \u201cItem 1. Business-Competition.\u201d\nPricing strategies continue to evolve in the mortgage insurance industry. In recent years, mortgage insurers generally have migrated away from a predominantly rate-card-based pricing model and toward the use of proprietary, \u201cblack box\u201d pricing frameworks that use a spectrum of filed rates to allow for formulaic, risk-based pricing based on multiple loan, borrower and property attributes that may be quickly adjusted within certain parameters. The shift toward the use of these granular risk-based pricing methodologies has contributed to a pricing environment that is more dynamic with more frequent pricing changes that can be implemented quickly, as well as an overall reduction in pricing transparency. As a result, we may not be aware of rate changes in the industry until we observe that our volume of NIW has changed. Further, in addition to the growing proliferation of black box pricing, industry pricing practices in recent years have also included an increased use of customized rate plans for certain customers, pursuant to which rates may be awarded to customers for only a limited period of time. The evolution of pricing strategies throughout the industry has resulted in greater volatility in our NIW and a reduction in industry pricing, including our pricing, due to the heightened competition inherent in the use of these pricing tools as compared to prior periods when standard rate cards were most prevalent.\nWith the increased prevalence of granular, \u201cblack box\u201d pricing and the greater uniformity of master policy terms throughout the industry, pricing has become the predominant competitive market factor for private mortgage insurance and an increasing number of customers are making their choice of mortgage insurance providers primarily based on the lowest price available for any particular loan. Our approach to pricing is customer-centric and flexible, as we offer a spectrum of risk-based pricing solutions for our customers that are designed to be balanced with our objectives for managing our volume of NIW and the risk/return profile of our insured portfolio. Although we believe we are well-positioned to compete effectively, our pricing strategy may not be successful and we may lose business to other competitors.\nGlossary\nPart I. Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe reduction in our premium rates due to heightened competition is expected to decrease the premium yield of our insured portfolio over time as older vintage insured loans with higher premium rates run-off and are replaced with insured loans with premium rates that are generally lower. It is possible that pricing competition could further intensify, which could result in a decrease in our projected returns. Despite our pricing actions, we may experience returns below our targeted returns. Our increased use of reinsurance over the past several years has helped to mitigate the negative effect of declining premium rates on our expected returns. However, reinsurance may not always be available or available on terms attractive to us. See \u201c-Reinsurance may not be available, affordable or adequate to protect us against losses.\u201d\nCertain of our private mortgage insurance competitors may have access to greater amounts of capital and financial resources than we do at a lower cost of capital (including through affiliated off-shore reinsurance vehicles) and some competitors currently have better financial strength ratings than we have. As a result, they may be better positioned to compete outside of traditional mortgage insurance, including by participating in alternative forms of credit enhancement that the GSEs may pursue outside of private mortgage insurance in its traditional form. In addition, because of tax advantages associated with being off-shore, which may become more pronounced if tax laws change in the future, certain of our competitors have been able to reinsure to their offshore affiliates and achieve higher after-tax rates of return on the NIW they write compared to mortgage insurers such as Radian Guaranty that do not have access to offshore affiliates. This tax structuring benefit could allow these off-shore competitors to leverage reduced pricing to gain market share, while continuing to achieve acceptable returns on NIW.\nWe also compete with governmental entities, such as the FHA and VA, primarily on the basis of loan limits, pricing, credit guidelines, terms of our insurance policies and loss mitigation practices. These governmental entities typically do not have the same capital requirements or business objectives that we and other private mortgage insurance companies have, and therefore, may have greater financial flexibility in their pricing guidelines and capacity that could put us at a competitive disadvantage. If these entities lower their pricing or alter the terms and conditions of their mortgage insurance or other credit enhancement products in furtherance of political, social or other goals rather than a profit motive, we may be unable to compete in that market effectively, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Regulation-Federal Regulation-Housing Finance Reform and the GSEs\u2019 Business Practices\u201d for further discussion of factors that could impact the FHA\u2019s competitive position relative to private mortgage insurance.\nIn addition, as market conditions change, alternatives to private mortgage insurance may become more prevalent, which could reduce the demand for private mortgage insurance in its traditional form. For example, alternatives to private mortgage insurance could include: investors using risk mitigation and credit risk transfer techniques other than private mortgage insurance (or accepting credit risk without credit enhancement); lenders and other investors holding mortgages in portfolio and self-insuring; and/or lenders originating mortgages using \u201cpiggyback\u201d structures to avoid private mortgage insurance. See \u201c-Changes in the charters, business practices or role of the GSEs in the U.S. housing market generally, could significantly impact our businesses\u201d for risks related to changes in the GSEs\u2019 business practices that could impact our competitive position, including the use of alternatives to traditional mortgage insurance to satisfy their charter requirements related to credit risk.\nThe competitive environment is extremely challenging given the multitude of factors discussed above. This environment, as well as potential further changes to this evolving environment, could negatively impact our franchise value, business prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur NIW and franchise value could decline if we lose business from significant customers.\nOur mortgage insurance business depends on our relationships with our customers. Our customers place insurance with us directly on loans they originate and they also do business with us indirectly through purchases of loans that already have our mortgage insurance coverage. Our relationships with our customers may influence both the amount of business they conduct with us directly and their willingness to continue to approve us as a mortgage insurance provider for loans that they purchase. The loss of business from significant customers could have an adverse effect on the amount of new business we are able to write, and consequently, our franchise value.\nIf we were to lose a significant customer, including as a result of customer consolidation, it is unlikely that the loss could be completely offset by other customers in the near-term, if at all. Lending customers may decide to write business only with a limited number of mortgage insurers or only with certain mortgage insurers, based on their views with respect to an insurer\u2019s information security and other compliance programs, pricing levels and pricing delivery methods, service levels, underwriting guidelines, loss mitigation practices, financial strength or other factors. With respect to pricing, industry pricing practices in recent years have also included an increased use of customized rate plans for many customers, pursuant to which rates may be awarded to customers for only a limited period of time. This has led to greater volatility in our customer relationships as we may retain, gain or lose customers based on the competitiveness of our proposed pricing levels over the proposed period, regardless of the other factors cited above that may influence a lender\u2019s decision whether to continue or commence doing business with us. See \u201c-Our mortgage insurance business faces intense competition.\u201d\nOur lending customers also may choose for risk management purposes to diversify the mortgage insurers with which they do business. Given that many of our customers currently give us a significant portion of their total mortgage insurance business, it is possible that further diversification could have a negative impact on our NIW if we are unable to mitigate the\nGlossary\nPart I. Item 1A. Risk Factors\nmarket share loss through new customers or increases in business with other customers. Further, we actively engage with our customers to ensure that we are receiving an appropriate mix of business at acceptable projected returns, and depending on the circumstances, we could take action with respect to customers (e.g., limiting the type of business we accept from them or instituting pricing changes that impact them) that could result in customers reducing the amount of business they do with us or deciding not to do business with us altogether. Finally, although we develop our product offerings and strategies to be complementary to our customers, we currently offer and may offer in the future, products that could be viewed as competitive to products offered by certain of our customers, which could influence a customer\u2019s decision as to whether to do business with us. Any significant loss in our market share could negatively impact our mortgage insurance franchise, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe current financial strength ratings assigned to our mortgage insurance subsidiaries could weaken our competitive position and potential downgrades by rating agencies to these ratings and the ratings assigned to Radian Group could adversely affect the Company.\nRadian Guaranty has been assigned a rating of Baa1 by Moody\u2019s, a rating of BBB+ by S&P and a rating of A- by Fitch. While Radian Guaranty\u2019s financial strength ratings currently are investment grade, certain of these ratings are below the ratings assigned to some of our competitors. We do not believe our ratings have had a material adverse effect on our relationships with existing customers. However, if financial strength ratings become a more prominent consideration for lenders, we may be competitively disadvantaged by customers choosing to do business with private mortgage insurers that have higher financial strength ratings. In addition, while the current PMIERs do not include a specific ratings requirement with respect to eligibility, if this were to change in the future, we may become subject to a ratings requirement in order to retain our eligibility status under the PMIERs. The ECF, in the form finalized in December 2020, generally provides more capital credit for transactions with more highly rated counterparties, which if translated to the PMIERs in the future, could potentially become a competitive disadvantage for us.\nThe GSEs currently consider financial strength ratings, among other items, to determine the amount of collateral that an insurer must post when participating in their credit risk transfer transactions. As a result, the returns that we are able to achieve if and when we participate in these transactions are dependent, in part, on our financial strength ratings. Further, a downgrade in our financial strength ratings could result in increased scrutiny of our financial condition by the GSEs and/or our customers, potentially resulting in a decrease in the amount of our NIW. Market participants with higher ratings than us are assigned lower collateral requirements by the GSEs for these transactions and generally have a lower cost of capital, which may give them a competitive advantage, including the ability to price more aggressively for these transactions.\nWe believe that financial strength ratings remain a significant consideration for participants seeking to secure credit enhancement in the non-GSE mortgage market, which includes most non-QM loans. While this market has remained limited since the financial crisis, we view this market as an area of potential long-term future growth, and our ability to successfully insure loans in this market could depend on our ability to secure higher ratings for our mortgage insurance subsidiaries. In addition, if legislative or regulatory changes were to alter the current state of the housing finance industry such that the GSEs no longer operate in their current capacity, we may be forced to compete in a new marketplace in which financial strength ratings may play a greater role.\nThe rating agencies continually review the financial strength ratings assigned to Radian Group and its mortgage insurance subsidiaries, and the ratings are subject to change. Downgrades to the ratings of our mortgage insurance subsidiaries and Radian Group could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity, access to capital markets and competitive position. In December 2021, S&P announced a proposed change to its rating methodologies for insurers, including mortgage insurers. It is uncertain whether it will be adopted in its current form, whether it will prompt similar moves at other rating agencies, or what impact the proposed change would have on us and on the way external parties evaluate the different rating levels. If we are unable to compete effectively in the current or any future markets as a result of the financial strength ratings assigned to our mortgage insurance subsidiaries, the franchise value and future prospects for our mortgage insurance business could be negatively affected.\nOur business depends, in part, on effective and reliable loan servicing.\nWe depend on third-party servicing of the loans that we insure. Dependable servicing is necessary for timely billing and premium payments to us and effective loss mitigation opportunities for delinquent or near-delinquent loans. Servicers are required to comply with a multitude of legal and regulatory requirements, procedures and standards for servicing residential mortgages, such as the CFPB\u2019s mortgage servicing rules. While these requirements are intended to ensure a high level of servicing performance, they also impose a high cost of compliance on servicers that may impact their financial condition and their operating effectiveness. The COVID-19 pandemic has placed additional burdens on many servicers. Challenging economic and market conditions or periods of economic stress and high mortgage defaults such as we have experienced due to the COVID-19 pandemic make it more difficult for servicers to effectively service the loans that we insure. Further, the various servicing-related requirements imposed by the CARES Act, the GSEs, the FHA, CFPB and other federal and state governmental and regulatory bodies and agencies to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mortgage borrowers heighten the burdens placed on servicers in the current environment and the potential scrutiny they face for their actions, which could influence their approach to the loans they are servicing.\nGlossary\nPart I. Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInformation with respect to the mortgage loans we insure is based in large part on information reported to us by third parties, including the servicers and originators of the mortgage loans, and information provided may be subject to lapses or inaccuracies in reporting from such third parties. In many cases, we may not be aware that information reported to us is incorrect until such time as a claim is made against us under the relevant insurance policy. We do not receive monthly information from servicers for single premium policies, and may not be aware that the mortgage loans insured by such policies have been repaid. We periodically attempt to determine if coverage is still in force on such policies by asking the last servicer of record or through the periodic reconciliation of loan information with certain servicers. It may be possible that our reports continue to reflect, as active, policies on mortgage loans that have been repaid.\nOur policies allow us to cancel coverage on loans that are not delinquent if the premiums are not paid within a grace period. However, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many states have enacted moratoriums on the cancellation of insurance due to non-payment. The specific provisions of the moratoriums vary from state to state. In the event a borrower fails to make mortgage payments, including as the result of a forbearance program, servicers often are required to advance such amounts, including principal and interest on the mortgage and amounts to cover taxes and insurance, for a period of time, including with respect to loans purchased by the GSEs. These required \u201cadvances\u201d may increase the financial strain on servicers, which could negatively impact their financial condition or otherwise disrupt their operations; although currently, in response to the pandemic, the FHFA and GSEs have implemented a four-month limit on servicer advance obligations for loans in forbearance which has reduced this financial burden. If we experience a disruption in the servicing of mortgage loans covered by our insurance policies or a failure by servicers to appropriately report the status of a loan, including whether the loan is subject to a COVID-19-related forbearance program, this, in turn, could impact the amount of assets Radian Guaranty is required to hold under the PMIERs or ultimately contribute to a rise in claims among those loans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nUnder the terms of our 2014 Master Policy and 2020 Master Policy, mortgage insurance premiums are not required to be paid following an event of default. However, if a defaulted loan then cures, all mortgage insurance premiums must be brought current for our insurance coverage to continue, including all premiums that were not paid during the period following the event of default and through the date of cure. Because premiums must be brought current upon a cure, mortgage servicers typically continue to pay mortgage insurance premiums while loans remain in default, understanding that Radian Guaranty will refund these premiums if the loans fail to cure and ultimately go to claim. If we fail to receive mortgage insurance premiums following mortgage defaults, Radian Guaranty\u2019s cash flow could be materially reduced, potentially requiring Radian Guaranty to liquidate investments at a loss to pay future claims or otherwise requiring us to alter our investment strategy.\nWe face risks associated with our contract underwriting business.\nWe provide third-party contract underwriting services for our mortgage insurance customers. Generally, we offer limited indemnification to our contract underwriting customers. In addition to indemnification, we typically have limited loss mitigation defenses available to us for loans that we have underwritten through our contract underwriting services. As a consequence, our results of operations could be negatively impacted if we are required to indemnify our customers for material underwriting errors in our contract underwriting services.\nA decrease in the volume of mortgage originations could result in fewer opportunities for us to write new mortgage insurance business and conduct our homegenius business.\nThe amount of new mortgage insurance business we write and real estate transactions we support through our homegenius title, real estate and technology products and services depends, among other things, on a steady flow of low down payment mortgages that benefit from our mortgage insurance and the volume of real estate transactions that require our services or products. The volume of mortgage originations is impacted by a number of factors, including:\n\u25a0restrictions on mortgage credit due to changes in lender underwriting standards, capital requirements affecting lenders, regulatory requirements such as the QM designation for mortgage loans and the health of the private securitization market;\n\u25a0mortgage interest rates;\n\u25a0the level of consumer confidence and the health of the domestic economy generally, as well as specific conditions in regional and local economies;\n\u25a0housing supply and affordability;\n\u25a0tax laws and policies and their impact on, among other things, deductions for mortgage insurance premiums, mortgage interest payments and real estate taxes;\n\u25a0demographic trends, including the rate of household formation;\n\u25a0the rate of home price appreciation;\n\u25a0government housing policy encouraging loans to first-time homebuyers; and\nGlossary\nPart I. Item 1A. Risk Factors\n\u25a0the practices of the GSEs, including the extent to which the guaranty fees, loan level price adjustments, credit underwriting guidelines and other business terms provided by the GSEs affect the cost of mortgages and lenders\u2019 willingness to extend credit for low down payment mortgages.\nThe U.S. housing and real estate markets generally have been strong in recent years, with markets supported by low interest rates, favorable demographics supporting growth in the population of first-time homebuyers and a relatively constrained supply of homes available for sale. While we expect demographic trends to continue to be favorable to housing and real estate, rising interest rates and the potential for economic uncertainty, as well as the persistent effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, could affect the number of new mortgages available for us to insure and real estate transactions available for our services.\nIf the overall volume of new mortgage originations declines, we would likely be subject to increased competition and we could experience a reduced opportunity to write new insurance business and provide our homegenius products and services, which could negatively affect our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with our homegenius business that could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur homegenius business exposes us to certain risks that may negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition, including, among others, the following:\n\u25a0Our homegenius business is driven primarily by digital products and services, including software as a service solutions and proprietary technology platforms that depend on our ability to develop, launch and implement new and innovative technologies and digital solutions. As a result, this business is particularly exposed to challenges associated with new and rapidly evolving technologies and business environments, customer acceptance of our digital product and service offerings, the costs associated with the development and launch of these technologies and products, our failure to successfully integrate new technologies into our existing systems and the risk that our digital product and services offerings fail to operate as expected or planned or that expose us to additional cybersecurity or third party risks;\n\u25a0Our homegenius business depends on our relationships with our customers. Our homegenius revenue is dependent on a limited number of large customers that represent a significant proportion of our homegenius total revenues. The loss or reduction of business from one or more of these significant customers could adversely affect the level of our homegenius revenues. In addition, Radian Guaranty does business with many of these significant customers. In the event of a dispute between a significant customer and either of our business segments, the overall customer relationship for Radian could be negatively impacted;\n\u25a0Due to the transactional nature of our business, our homegenius segment revenues are subject to fluctuation from period to period and are difficult to predict;\n\u25a0The services we offer through our homegenius business are influenced by the level of overall activity in the mortgage, real estate and mortgage finance markets generally. If real estate transaction volumes decline, we could experience less demand for our real estate and title services;\n\u25a0Red Bell is a licensed real estate brokerage and provides real estate brokerage services in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. As a licensed real estate brokerage, Red Bell receives residential real estate information from various multiple listing services. Red Bell receives this information, which it uses in its business to broker real estate transactions and provide valuation products and services that comprise many of our homegenius product offerings, pursuant to the terms of agreements with the MLS providers. If these agreements were to terminate or Red Bell otherwise were to lose access to this information, it could negatively impact Red Bell\u2019s ability to conduct its business and our future real estate strategies. In addition to MLS data, we depend on access to data from a variety of other external sources to maintain our databases and grow our businesses. If we were to lose access to one or more of these data sources, the quality, pricing and availability of our homegenius products and services may be negatively impacted;\n\u25a0By their nature, title claims are often complex, vary greatly in dollar amounts and are affected by economic and market conditions and the legal environment existing at the time of settlement of the claims. Estimating future title loss payments is difficult because of the complex nature of title claims, the long periods of time over which claims are administered and paid, significantly varying dollar amounts of individual claims and other factors. From time to time, we could experience large losses or an overall worsening of our loss payment experience in regard to the frequency or severity of claims that require us to record additional charges to our claims loss reserve. These loss events are unpredictable and may require us to increase our title loss reserves and could adversely affect the financial performance of our homegenius business; and\n\u25a0Our homegenius business operates in a highly competitive environment. Our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the services they offer, and many have substantial resources. We expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new competitors and technologies. There can be no assurance that our homegenius business will be able to compete successfully.\nGlossary\nPart I. Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAny of these factors could negatively effect on our homegenius business and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely upon proprietary technology and information, and if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, it could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur success depends, in part, upon our intellectual property rights. We rely primarily on a combination of patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions on copying, distribution and creation of derivative products to protect our proprietary technology and information. This protection is limited, and our intellectual property could be used by others without our consent. In addition, patents may not be issued with respect to our pending or future patent applications, and our patents may not be upheld as valid or may not prevent the development of competitive products. Any infringement, disclosure, loss, invalidity of or failure to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, litigation may be necessary to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Such litigation could be time-consuming, result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Economic Environment\nThe credit performance of our mortgage insurance portfolio is impacted by macroeconomic conditions and specific events that affect the ability of borrowers to pay their mortgages.\nMortgage defaults occur due to a variety of specific events affecting individual borrowers, including death or illness, divorce or other family related factors, and unemployment, among other events. While mortgage defaults can and do occur in any economic environment, there is a high correlation between the overall health of the economy and the performance of our mortgage insurance portfolio. As a result, our results are particularly influenced by macroeconomic conditions and specific events that impact the housing finance and real estate markets, including events that impact mortgage originations and the credit performance of our mortgage insurance portfolio, most of which are beyond our control, including housing prices, inflationary pressures, unemployment levels, interest rate changes, the availability of credit and other national and regional economic conditions. These conditions may be created or exacerbated by acts of terrorism, war or other conflicts, event-specific economic depressions, severe weather events and natural disasters, which may continue to increase in severity and frequency due to climate change, and other catastrophic events such as the COVID-19 pandemic or other future epidemics or pandemics. In general, challenging economic conditions increase the likelihood that borrowers will not have sufficient income to satisfy their mortgage obligations.\nIn addition, a deteriorating economy also can adversely affect housing values, which in turn can influence the willingness of borrowers to continue to make mortgage payments despite having the financial resources to do so. In addition, a decline in home values typically makes it more difficult for borrowers to sell or refinance their homes, increasing the likelihood that a default will result in a claim. Declining housing values may impact the effectiveness of our loss mitigation actions. The amount of the loss we could suffer depends in part on whether the home of a borrower who defaults on a mortgage can be sold for an amount that will cover the unpaid principal balance, interest and the expenses of the sale. Any of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAs discussed above under \u201c-Radian Guaranty may fail to maintain its eligibility status with the GSEs, and the additional capital required to support Radian Guaranty\u2019s eligibility could reduce our available liquidity,\u201d the COVID-19 pandemic produced periods of significant economic disruption, including high unemployment, and volatility and disruption in financial markets, that resulted in an elevated number of mortgage defaults, including defaults derived from mortgage forbearance programs that were instituted to support borrowers experiencing COVID-19 related hardships. Uncertainty regarding the pandemic\u2019s scope, severity and duration, and its resulting impact on the economy, continues to persist as the pandemic evolves, and it is difficult to predict the ultimate impact that the COVID-19 pandemic may have on the credit performance of our mortgage insurance portfolio.\nUnfavorable macroeconomic developments, including the ongoing economic uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the other factors cited above, may again have a material negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to manage risks in our investment portfolio.\nOur investment portfolio is an important source of revenue and is our primary source of claims paying resources. Although our investment portfolio consists primarily of highly-rated fixed income investments, our investment strategy is affected by general economic conditions, which may adversely affect the markets for credit and interest-rate-sensitive securities, including the extent and timing of investor participation in these markets, the level and volatility of interest rates and credit spreads and, consequently, the value of our fixed income securities, and as such, we may not achieve our investment objectives. Volatility or lack of liquidity in the markets in which we invest has at times reduced the market value of some of our investments, including most recently as a result of the disruption in the financial markets due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The value of our investment portfolio may also be adversely affected by ratings downgrades, bankruptcies and credit spreads\nGlossary\nPart I. Item 1A. Risk Factors\nwidening in distressed industries. In addition, when the credit environment deteriorates, the risk of impairments of our investments increases. If the financial markets experience disruption and volatility, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nInterest rates and investment yields on our investments continue to be low compared to historical averages, which has reduced the investment yield on our investment portfolio. For the significant portion of our investment portfolio held by our insurance subsidiaries, to receive favorable treatment under insurance regulatory requirements and full credit as Available Assets under the PMIERs, we generally are limited to investing in investment grade fixed income investments that are unlikely to increase our overall investment yields. Because we depend on our investments as a source of revenue, a prolonged period of lower than expected investment yields would have an adverse impact on our revenues and could adversely affect our results of operations. Further, future updates to the Model Act or PMIERs, including potentially to align with the ECF or proposed liquidity requirements for the GSEs, could restrict our investment choices, which could negatively impact our investment strategy.\nIn addition, we structure our investment portfolio to satisfy our expected liabilities, including claim payments in our mortgage insurance business. If we underestimate our future claim payments or other liabilities or improperly structure our investments to meet these liabilities, we could have unexpected losses resulting from the forced liquidation of investments before their maturity, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nClimate change and extreme weather events could adversely affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur businesses, results of operations and financial performance could be adversely impacted by climate change and extreme weather events, especially if these occurrences negatively impact the overall real estate market and the broader economy. Climate change may increase the frequency and severity of natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods and forest fires and drive other ecologically related changes such as rising sea waters, which in turn could negatively affect regional economies in ways that impact home values or unemployment, and therefore, the credit performance of the mortgages we insure in affected areas. Further, climate change and natural disasters may impact the value of and cause volatility in our investment portfolio, and we might not achieve our investment objectives. Climate change and the frequency, severity, duration, and geography of severe weather events and other ecological related changes are inherently uncertain, and we cannot predict the ultimate impact these events may have on our business and financial condition.\nOur reported earnings, stockholders\u2019 equity and book value per share are subject to fluctuations based on changes in our investments that require us to adjust their fair market value.\nWe have significant holdings of trading securities, equity securities and short-term investments that we carry at fair value. Because the changes in fair value of these financial instruments are reflected on our statements of operations each period, they affect our reported earnings and can create earnings volatility. In addition, we increase or decrease our stockholders\u2019 equity by the amount of change in the unrealized gain or loss (the difference between the fair value and the amortized cost) of our available for sale securities portfolio, net of related tax, under the category of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). As a result, a decline in the fair value of our available for sale portfolio may result in a decline in reported stockholders\u2019 equity, as well as book value per common share. Among other factors, interest rate changes, market volatility and declines in the value of underlying collateral will impact the value of our investments, potentially resulting in unrealized losses that could negatively impact our results of operations and stockholders\u2019 equity. These negative impacts will occur even though the securities are not sold. Also, in the event there are credit loss related impairments, the credit loss component and subsequent recoveries, if any, are recognized in earnings.\nThe discontinuance of LIBOR may adversely affect us.\nIn 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (the \u201cFCA\u201d), which regulates LIBOR, announced that after 2021, it would no longer compel banks to submit rate quotations required to calculate LIBOR. The FCA no longer publishes one-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR rates and plans to cease publishing all other LIBOR tenors (overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month and 12-month) on June 30, 2023. In addition, the U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a committee consisting of representatives of large U.S. financial institutions, has recommended replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR. SOFR is the rate charged on overnight repurchase obligations collateralized by Treasury securities, and is compiled by the New York Federal Reserve Bank. It is not presently known whether SOFR or any other alternative reference rates will attain broad market acceptance as replacements of LIBOR. There remains uncertainty as to how the financial services industry will address the discontinuance of LIBOR in financial instruments that are indexed to LIBOR. Further, various financial instruments indexed to LIBOR could experience different outcomes based on their contractual terms, ability to amend those terms, market or product type, legal or regulatory jurisdiction, and other factors. Alternative reference rates that replace LIBOR may not yield the same or similar economic results over the lives of the financial instruments, which could adversely affect the value of and return on these instruments.\nThe discontinuation of LIBOR may have an adverse effect on the premium rates we are required to pay in connection with certain of our excess-of-loss reinsurance agreements associated with our existing insurance-linked notes transactions,\nGlossary\nPart I. Item 1A. Risk Factors\nwhich are tied to LIBOR, or may negatively impact the value of other assets or liabilities whose value is tied to LIBOR or to a LIBOR alternative, including floating rate bonds that we hold in our investment portfolio. The discontinuation of LIBOR also could increase the cost of borrowings under our credit facility, which currently uses LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. Although our insurance-linked notes transactions and our credit facility provides for a transition from LIBOR upon the occurrence of specified events, there is substantial uncertainty as to the effect of such replacement. Furthermore, in addition to potential impacts on our investment portfolio and our cost of debt, the discontinuation of LIBOR may impact other aspects of our business, such as our insurance products, the pricing we charge and the models we use to support our business decisions. It is possible that the discontinuance of LIBOR, including the implementation of alternative benchmark rates to LIBOR, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nRisks Related to Liquidity and Financing\nRadian Group\u2019s sources of liquidity may be insufficient to fund its obligations.\nRadian Group serves as the holding company for our operating subsidiaries and does not have any operations of its own. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Liquidity Analysis-Holding Company\u201d for more information on our available liquidity and short-term and long-term liquidity demands.\nAs discussed above under \u201c-Radian Guaranty may fail to maintain its eligibility status with the GSEs, and the additional capital required to support Radian Guaranty\u2019s eligibility could reduce our available liquidity,\u201d the COVID-19 pandemic produced periods of significant economic disruption that resulted in an elevated number of mortgage defaults, including defaults derived from mortgage forbearance programs that were instituted to support borrowers experiencing COVID-19 related hardships. Uncertainty regarding the pandemic\u2019s scope, severity and duration, and its resulting impact on the economy, continues to persist as the pandemic evolves, and it is difficult to predict the ultimate impact that the COVID-19 pandemic may have on the credit performance of our mortgage insurance portfolio. If additional capital support for Radian Guaranty is required to maintain compliance with the PMIERs financial requirements, we may be required or otherwise choose to contribute capital to Radian Guaranty. The amount that Radian Group could be required to contribute to Radian Guaranty could be significant and, under extreme economic scenarios, exhaust Radian Group\u2019s available liquidity. See \u201c-Radian Guaranty may fail to maintain its eligibility status with the GSEs, and the additional capital required to support Radian Guaranty\u2019s eligibility could reduce our available liquidity\u201d above for additional information.\nIn addition to available cash and marketable securities, Radian Group\u2019s most significant near-term sources of cash to fund future liquidity needs include: (i) payments made to Radian Group by its subsidiaries under expense- and tax-sharing arrangements; and (ii) net investment income earned on its cash and marketable securities. Radian Group\u2019s expense-sharing arrangements with its principal operating subsidiaries require those subsidiaries to pay their allocated share of certain holding-company-level expenses, including interest payments on Radian Group\u2019s outstanding senior notes. The expense-sharing arrangements between Radian Group and our mortgage insurance subsidiaries, as amended, have been approved by the Pennsylvania Insurance Department, but such approval may be modified or revoked at any time.\nIn light of Radian Guaranty\u2019s negative unassigned surplus related to operating losses in prior periods, the ongoing need to set aside contingency reserves, and the current ongoing economic uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which could increase losses in future periods, we do not anticipate that Radian Guaranty will be permitted under applicable insurance laws to pay ordinary dividends to Radian Group for the next several years. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on contingency reserve requirements.\nIn light of Radian Group\u2019s short- and long-term needs, it is possible that our sources of liquidity could be insufficient to fund our obligations. If this were to occur, we may choose not to pursue certain actions, such as issuing dividends or repurchasing shares of our common stock, or we may elect to reduce the levels of these activities to preserve our available liquidity. In addition, we may seek to increase our available liquidity, which we may be unable to do on favorable terms, if at all.\nOur revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants that could limit our operating flexibility. A default under our credit facility could trigger an event of default under the terms of our senior notes. We may not have access to funding under our credit facility when we require it.\nRadian Group is a party to a $275.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of bank lenders. As of December 31, 2021, no borrowings were outstanding under the credit facility.\nThe credit facility contains customary representations, warranties, covenants, terms and conditions. Our ability to borrow under the credit facility is conditioned on the satisfaction of certain financial and other restrictive covenants, including covenants related to minimum net worth and statutory capital, a maximum debt-to-capitalization level, repayment or refinancing of a portion of our senior debt maturities prior to their maturity, and limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments, create liens, transfer or dispose of assets and merge with or acquire other companies. The credit facility also requires that Radian Guaranty remain eligible under the PMIERs to insure loans purchased by the GSEs. A failure to comply with these covenants or the other terms of the credit facility could result in an event of default, which could: (i) result in the termination of the commitments by the lenders to make loans to Radian Group under the credit facility and (ii)\nGlossary\nPart I. Item 1A. Risk Factors\nenable the lenders to declare, subject to the terms and conditions of the credit facility, any outstanding obligations under the credit facility to be immediately due and payable.\nFurther, the occurrence of an event of default under the terms of our credit facility may trigger an event of default under the terms of our senior notes. An event of default would occur under the terms of our senior notes if a default: (i) in any scheduled payment of principal of other indebtedness by Radian Group or its subsidiaries of more than $100 million principal amount occurs, after giving effect to any applicable grace period or (ii) in the performance of any term or provision of any indebtedness of Radian Group or its subsidiaries in excess of $100 million principal amount occurs that results in the acceleration of the date such indebtedness is due and payable, subject to certain limited exceptions. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the carrying value of our senior notes.\nIf the commitments of the lenders under the credit facility are terminated or we are unable to satisfy certain covenants or representations, we may not have access to funding in a timely manner, or at all, when we require it. If funding is not available under the credit facility when we require it, our ability to continue our business practices or pursue our current strategy could be limited. If the indebtedness under the credit facility or our senior notes is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it.\nRisks Related to Information Technology and Cybersecurity\nOur information technology systems may fail or become outmoded, be temporarily interrupted or otherwise cause us to be unable to meet our customers\u2019 demands.\nOur business is highly dependent on the effective operation of our information technology systems, which are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cyber-attacks and security incidents or breaches, catastrophic events and errors in usage. Although we have disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place, we may not be able to adequately execute these plans in a timely fashion.\nAdditionally, our ability to meet the needs of our customers depends on our ability to keep pace with technological advances and to invest in new technology as it becomes available or to otherwise upgrade our technological capabilities. We rely on e-commerce and other technologies to provide our products and services to our customers, and they generally require that we provide an increasing number of our products and services electronically. Accordingly, we may not satisfy our customers\u2019 requirements if we fail to invest sufficient resources or are otherwise unable to maintain and upgrade our technological capabilities. Further, customers may choose to do business only with business partners with which they are technologically compatible and may choose to retain existing relationships with mortgage insurance or mortgage and real estate services providers rather than invest the time and resources to on-board new providers. As a result, technology can represent a potential barrier to signing new customers.\nBecause we rely on our information technology systems for many critical functions, including connecting with our customers, if such systems were to fail, experience a prolonged interruption or become outmoded, we may experience a significant disruption in our operations and in the business we receive, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe could incur significant liability or reputational harm if the security of our information technology systems is breached, including as result of a cyberattack, or we otherwise fail to protect confidential information, including personally identifiable information that we maintain.\nWe rely on information technology systems to process, transmit, store and protect the electronic information, financial data and proprietary models that are critical to our business. Furthermore, a significant portion of the communications between us and our employees, customers, business partners and service providers depends on information technology and electronic information exchange.\nOur reliance on information technology has been further accelerated by the widespread transition to work-from-home measures following the outbreak of COVID-19. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in order to protect our employees and in response to governmental and other third-party measures restricting interpersonal contact, travel and business operations, we activated our business continuity program by transitioning to a work-from-home virtual workforce model. Remote working arrangements may increase the risk of cyber-security attacks or data security incidents.\nOur information technology systems may be vulnerable to physical or electronic intrusions, malware or other attacks, including cyberattacks. In recent years, cyberattacks such as distributed denial of service attacks, hacking, malware, ransomware, phishing or other forms of social engineering and insider threats designed to obtain confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or to cause other damage have grown in volume and level of sophistication. Security incidents have from time to time occurred and may occur in the future. Although to date security incidents have not had a material impact on us, the risks of cyberattacks and information security incidents and breaches continue to increase in businesses such as ours due to, among other things, the proliferation of new technologies and the use of digital channels to conduct our business, including connectivity with customer devices that are beyond our security control systems and the use of portable computers or mobile devices which can be stolen, lost or damaged. Globally, attacks are\nGlossary\nPart I. Item 1A. Risk Factors\nexpected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that could hinder our ability to identify, investigate and recover from incidents.\nAs part of our business, we, and certain of our subsidiaries, affiliates and third-party vendors, maintain large amounts of confidential information, including personally identifiable information on borrowers, consumers and our employees. If the security of our information technology or the technology of our third-party vendors is breached, including as a result of a cyberattack, it could result in the loss or misuse of this information, which could, in turn, result in potential regulatory actions or litigation, including material claims for damages, as well as interruption to our operations and damage to our customer relationships and reputation. While we have information security policies, controls and systems in place in order to attempt to prevent, detect and respond to unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information, including personally identifiable information, there can be no assurance that such use or disclosure will not occur. Any cybersecurity event or other compromise of the security of our information technology systems, or unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information, could subject us to liability, regulatory scrutiny and action, damage our reputation and negatively affect our ability to attract and maintain customers, and could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Us and Our Subsidiaries Generally\nWe may not continue to pay dividends at the same rate we are currently paying them, or at all, and any decrease in or suspension of payment of a dividend could cause our stock price to decline.\nEffective February 9, 2022, Radian Group\u2019s board of directors authorized an increase in the Company\u2019s quarterly dividend from $0.14 per share to $0.20 per share, effective for the quarterly dividend payable on March 3, 2022. The payment of future cash dividends is subject to the determination each quarter by our board of directors that the dividend remains in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders, which determination will be based on a number of factors, including, among others, economic conditions, our earnings, financial condition, actual and forecasted cash flows, capital resources, capital requirements and alternative uses of capital, including potential investments to support our business strategy and possible acquisitions or investments in new businesses. Any decrease in the amount of the dividend, or suspension or discontinuance of payment of a dividend, could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe are subject to litigation and regulatory proceedings.\nWe operate in highly regulated industries that are subject to a heightened risk of litigation and regulatory proceedings. From time to time we are a party to material litigation and also are subject to legal and regulatory claims, assertions, actions, reviews, audits, inquiries and investigations. Additional lawsuits, legal and regulatory proceedings and inquiries and other matters may arise in the future. The outcome of existing and future legal and regulatory proceedings and inquiries and other matters could result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, injunctions, restitutions or other relief which could require significant expenditures or have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition. See \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d and Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe rely on our management team and our business could be harmed if we are unable to retain qualified personnel or successfully develop and/or recruit their replacements.\nOur success depends, in part, on the skills, working relationships and continued services of our management team and other key personnel, any of whom could terminate his or her relationship with us at any time. Competition for personnel is intense and has increased in light of evolving labor and employment trends, including but not limited to the increase in employee resignations throughout the United States, as well as the increase in remote, hybrid or other alternative flexible work arrangements. The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting increase in work from home arrangements within many industries, including ours, has increased the likelihood that highly skilled individuals may seek to change employers in pursuit of greater opportunities or greater benefits. In this environment, it may be more difficult to retain key personnel or to attract new resources who now may have greater optionality among potential employers given the ability to work from home. The unexpected departure of key personnel could adversely affect the conduct of our business. In such event, we would be required to obtain other personnel to manage and operate our business. In addition, we will be required to replace the knowledge and expertise of our workforce as our workers retire. In either case, there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop or recruit suitable replacements for the departing individuals, that replacements could be hired, if necessary, on terms that are favorable to us, or that we can successfully transition such replacements in a timely manner. Failure to effectively implement our succession planning efforts and to ensure effective transfers of knowledge and smooth transitions involving members of our management team and other key personnel could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Without a properly skilled and experienced workforce, our costs, including costs associated with a loss of productivity and costs to replace employees, may increase, and this could negatively impact our earnings.\nInvestments to grow our existing businesses, pursue new lines of business or new products and services within existing lines of business subject us to additional risks and uncertainties.\nIn support of our growth and diversification strategy, we may make investments to grow our existing businesses, pursue new lines of business or new products and services within existing lines of business. We may do this through strategic\nGlossary\nPart I. Item 1A. Risk Factors\ntransactions, including investments and acquisitions, or pursue other transformative actions and initiatives. These activities expose us to additional risks and uncertainties that include, without limitation:\n\u25a0the use of capital and potential diversion of other resources, such as the diversion of management\u2019s attention from our core businesses and potential disruption of those businesses;\n\u25a0the assumption of liabilities in connection with any strategic transaction, including any acquired business;\n\u25a0our ability to comply with additional regulatory requirements associated with new products, services, lines of business or other business or strategic initiatives;\n\u25a0our ability to successfully integrate or develop the operations of any new business initiative or acquisition;\n\u25a0new business initiatives may be disruptive to, or competitive with, our existing customers;\n\u25a0we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of a strategic transaction or initiative, including expected synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities, within the anticipated timeframe or at all;\n\u25a0new business initiatives may expose us to liquidity risk, risks associated with the use of financial leverage, and market risks, including risk resulting from changes in the fair values of assets in which we invest. Further, new business initiatives may increase our exposure to interest rate risk and may involve changes in our investment, financing and hedging strategies;\n\u25a0we may fail to achieve forecasted results for a strategic transaction or initiative that could result in lower or negative earnings contribution and/or impairment charges associated with intangible assets acquired; and\n\u25a0the risk of reputational harm if the strategic transaction or initiative fails to increase our market value.", "PERMNO": 78038, "SIC": 6351, "TIC": "RDN"}
