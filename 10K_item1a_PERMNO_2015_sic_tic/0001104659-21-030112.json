{"cik": "1124524", "company": "Cryoport, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-01", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following risk factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These risk factors do not identify all of the risks that we face. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial.\nRisks Related to Our Business Combinations\nThe MVE Biological Solutions and CRYOPDP acquisitions have resulted in organizational change and significant growth to our business. If we fail to effectively manage this growth and change to our business in a manner that preserves our reputation with customers and the key aspects of our corporate culture, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nThe MVE Biological Solutions and CRYOPDP acquisitions have resulted in significant growth in our operations and personnel, adding approximately 460 employees to our headcount, bringing our total headcount as of December 31, 2020 to approximately 625 employees, adding significant operations in the US, Europe and Asia, while expanding our product offerings into new temperature-controlled ranges and cryogenic equipment. We will continue to incur significant expenditures and the allocation of management time to assimilate the MVE Biological Solutions and CRYOPDP businesses in a manner that preserves the key aspects of our corporate culture, including a focus on strong customer satisfaction, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts. If we do not effectively integrate, train and manage our combined employee base and maintain strong relationships with both our existing and new customers, our corporate culture could be undermined, the quality of our products and customer service could suffer, and our reputation could be harmed, each of which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe actual impact of the MVE Biological Solutions and CRYOPDP acquisitions on our financial results may be worse than the assumptions we have used.\nWe have made certain assumptions relating to the impact on our financial results of the MVE Biological Solutions and CRYOPDP acquisitions. These assumptions relate to numerous matters, including the acquisition costs, including transaction and integration costs, and other financial and strategic risks of the acquisitions. If one or more of these assumptions are incorrect, it could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results, and the perceived benefits from the acquisitions may not be realized.\nThe integration and operation of acquired businesses, including MVE Biological Solutions and CRYOPDP, may disrupt our business and create additional expenses, and we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions.\nIntegration of an acquired business involves numerous risks, including assimilation of operations of the acquired business, such as MVE Biological Solutions and CRYOPDP, and difficulties in the convergence of systems and processes, the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, risks of entering markets in which we have had no or only limited direct experience, assumption of unknown or unquantifiable liabilities, difficulties in completing strategic initiatives already underway in the acquired company, and unfamiliarity with partners of the acquired company, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In particular, the integration of businesses the size of MVE Biological Solutions and CRYOPDP into our business may be more difficult and time consuming than anticipated, and we may be unable to achieve the expected synergies and operating efficiencies within the expected time frames or at all. We cannot assure that these risks or other unforeseen factors will not offset the intended benefits of the acquisitions, in whole or in part.\nAdditionally, potential acquisition opportunities become available to us from time to time, and we periodically engage in discussions or negotiations relating to potential acquisitions, including acquisitions that may be material in size or scope to our business. Any acquisition may or may not occur and, if an acquisition does occur, it may not be successful in enhancing our business for one or more of the following reasons:\n\u25cf Any business acquired may not be integrated successfully and may not prove profitable\u037e\n\u25cf The price we pay for any business acquired may overstate the value of that business or otherwise be too high\u037e\n\u25cf Liabilities we take on through the acquisition may prove to be higher than we expected\u037e\n\u25cf We may fail to achieve acquisition synergies\u037e or\n\u25cf The focus on the integration of operations of acquired entities may divert management\u2019s attention from the day-to-day operation of our businesses.\nAcquisitions and strategic investments and alliances may also require us to integrate and collaborate with a different company culture, management team, business model, business infrastructure and sales and distribution methodology and assimilate and retain geographically dispersed, decentralized operations and personnel. Depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition, our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors, including introducing new products and meeting revenue targets as expected, the retention of key employees and key customers, increased exposure to certain governmental regulations and compliance requirements and increased costs and use of resources. Further, the integration of acquired businesses is likely to result in our systems and internal controls becoming increasingly complex and more difficult to manage. Any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations.\nEven if we are able to successfully integrate acquired businesses, we may not be able to realize the revenue and other synergies and growth that we anticipated from the acquisition in the time frame that we expected, and the costs of achieving these benefits may be higher than what we expected. As a result, the acquisition and integration of acquired businesses may not contribute to our earnings as expected and we may not achieve the other anticipated strategic and financial benefits of such transactions.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur products and services may contain errors or defects, which could result in damage to our reputation, lost revenues, diverted development resources and increased service costs, litigation and product recalls.\nOur products and services must meet stringent requirements and we must develop our products and services solutions quickly to keep pace with the rapidly changing market. Product and services as sophisticated as ours could contain undetected errors or defects, especially when first introduced or when new equipment or versions of our software are released. If our product and services are not free from errors or defects, we may incur an injury to our reputation, lost revenues, diverted development resources, increased customer service and support costs, product recalls and litigation. The costs incurred in correcting any product errors or defects may be substantial and could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nDue to the low temperatures at which some of our products are used and the fact that some of our products are relied upon by our customers or end users in their facilities or operations or are manufactured for relatively broad medical, transportation, or consumer use, we face an inherent risk of exposure to claims (which MVE Biological Solutions has been subject to from time to time and some of which were substantial) in the event that the failure, use, or misuse of our products results, or is alleged to result, in death, bodily injury, property or sample damage, or economic loss. For example, during 2019, MVE Biological Solutions\u2019 products were the subject of numerous lawsuits (including purported class action lawsuits filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California) with respect to the alleged failure of a stainless steel cryobiological storage tank at the Pacific Fertility Center in San Francisco, California. In addition, Cryogene specializes in the secure storage of biological specimens, materials and samples covering the full range of temperatures from cryogenic through controlled room temperature. Any damage to these specimens, materials and samples may be attributed to a failure of Cryogene\u2019s storage systems or services, which could lead to claims for damages made by customers and could also harm our relationship with customers and damage our reputation in the life sciences industry, resulting in material harm to our business. Although we currently maintain product liability coverage, which we believe is adequate for product liability claims and for the continued operation of our business, it includes customary exclusions and conditions, it may not cover certain specialized applications and it generally does not cover warranty claims. Additionally, such insurance may become difficult to obtain or be unobtainable in the future on terms acceptable to us. A successful product liability claim or series of claims against us, including one or more consumer claims purporting to constitute class actions or claims resulting from extraordinary loss events, in excess of or outside our insurance coverage, or a significant warranty claim or series of claims against us, could materially decrease our liquidity, impair our financial condition, and adversely affect our results of operations. See \u201c-Risks Related to Our Business-Our products and services may expose us to liability in excess of our current insurance coverage\u201d for additional information.\nIn addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in, among other things, costs of litigation, distraction of management\u2019s attention from our primary business, the inability to commercialize our existing or new products, decreased demand for our products or, if cleared or approved, products in development, damage to our business reputation, product recalls or withdrawals from the market, withdrawal of clinical trial participants, substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants, or loss of revenue.\nWhile we may attempt to manage our product liability exposure by proactively recalling or withdrawing from the market any defective products, any recall or market withdrawal of our products may delay the supply of those products to our customers and may impact our reputation. We can provide no assurance that we will be successful in initiating appropriate market recall or market withdrawal efforts that may be required in the future or that these efforts will have the intended effect of preventing product malfunctions and the accompanying product liability that may result. Additionally, any recall could result in significant costs to us and significant adverse publicity, which could harm our ability to market our products in the future. Such recalls and withdrawals may also be used by our competitors to harm our reputation for safety or be perceived by patients as a safety risk when considering the use of our products. Though it may not be possible to quantify the economic impact of a recall, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, for some of our products we offer a limited warranty for product returns which are due to defects in quality and workmanship. We attempt to estimate our potential liability for future product returns and establish reserves on our financial statements in amounts that we believe will be sufficient to address our warranty obligations; however, our actual liability for product returns may significantly exceed the amount of our reserves. If we underestimate our potential liability for future product returns, or if unanticipated events result in returns that exceed our historical experience, our financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe recent global pandemic caused by COVID-19 has already and may continue to adversely affect our business operations, financial performance and results of operations, the extent of which is uncertain and difficult to predict.\nIn late 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China, which has since spread globally. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. Further, the COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in government authorities around the world implementing numerous measures to try to reduce the impact of COVID-19, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place or total lock-down orders. Many countries around the world have also implemented the temporary closure of non-essential businesses and other material limitations on the conduct of business. As a result of the COVID-19 outbreak and the related responses from government authorities, our business operations, financial performance and results of operations have been adversely affected as a result of reduced demand for our services in all markets. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Recent Developments - Impact of COVID-19\u201d for additional information.\nAdditionally, our business operations, financial performance and results of operations have been and could be further adversely impacted in a number of ways, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf disruptions to our operations, including a shutdown of one or more of our global logistics centers or our biostorage facility; restrictions on our operations and sales, marketing and distribution efforts; and interruptions to our research and development activities, engineering, design and manufacturing processes and other important business activities;\n\u25cf further reduced demand for our products and services due to disruptions to the businesses and operations of our customers, which may, in particular, result from lower volumes of clinical studies and trials or reduced activity in the human reproductive medicine markets due to social distancing restrictions; and reduction in our animal health market due to reduced demand;\n\u25cf interruptions, unavailability or delays in global shipping to transport our products;\n\u25cf a slowdown or stoppage in the supply chain for our products;\n\u25cf our ability to set up global supply chain centers in certain geographic regions;\n\u25cf limitations on employee resources and availability, including due to sickness, government restrictions, the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people or mass transit disruptions;\n\u25cf a fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates could result from market uncertainties;\n\u25cf an increase in the cost or the difficulty to obtain debt or equity financing could affect our financial condition or our ability to fund operations or future investment opportunities; and\n\u25cf an increase in regulatory restrictions or continued market volatility could hinder our ability to execute strategic business activities, including acquisitions, as well as negatively impact our stock price.\nThe spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices (including employee travel, employee work locations, and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences), and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, and suppliers. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus, and our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed.\nAdditionally, COVID-19 could negatively affect our internal controls over financial reporting as a portion of our workforce is required to work from home and therefore new processes, procedures, and controls could be required to respond to changes in our business environment. Further, should any key employees become ill from COVID-19 and unable to work, the attention of the management team could be diverted.\nThe potential effects of COVID-19 may also impact and potentially heighten many of our other risk factors discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. The degree to which COVID-19 impacts our business operations, financial performance and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, continuously evolving and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the COVID-19 outbreak, its severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume.\nAs an increasingly global business, we are exposed to economic, political, and other risks in different countries which could materially reduce our sales, profitability or cash flows, or materially increase our liabilities.\nSince we manufacture and sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. Our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:\n\u25cf changes in foreign currency exchange rates, exchange controls and currency restrictions;\n\u25cf changes in a specific country\u2019s or region\u2019s political, social or economic conditions;\n\u25cf civil unrest, turmoil or outbreak of disease or illness, such as COVID-19, in any of the countries in which we sell our products or in which we or our suppliers operate;\n\u25cf tariffs, other trade protection measures, and import or export licensing requirements;\n\u25cf potentially negative consequences from changes in U.S. and international tax laws;\n\u25cf difficulty in staffing and managing geographically widespread operations;\n\u25cf requirements relating to withholding taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries;\n\u25cf restrictions on our ability to own or operate subsidiaries, make investments or acquire new businesses in these jurisdictions;\n\u25cf restrictions on our ability to repatriate dividends from our foreign subsidiaries;\n\u25cf difficulty in collecting international accounts receivable;\n\u25cf difficulty in enforcement of contractual obligations under non-U.S. law;\n\u25cf transportation delays or interruptions; and\n\u25cf changes in regulatory requirements including as it relates to protection of our intellectual property.\nWe will have difficulty increasing our revenues if we experience delays, difficulties or unanticipated costs in establishing the sales, marketing and distribution capabilities necessary to successfully commercialize our solutions.\nWe plan to further enhance our sales, marketing and distribution capabilities in the Americas, EMEA, and APAC, including through our recent acquisitions of MVE Biological Solutions and CRYOPDP, which expands our sales, marketing and distribution capabilities in these regions. It will be expensive and time-consuming for us to develop and integrate our global marketing and sales network and thus we intend to further broaden our strategic alliances with domestic and international providers of shipping services and other solutions providers to the life sciences industry to incorporate use of our platform of solutions in their service offerings. We may not be able to provide adequate incentive to our sales force or to establish and maintain favorable distribution and marketing collaborations with others to promote our solutions. In addition, any third party with whom we have established a marketing and distribution relationship may not devote sufficient time to the marketing and sales of our solutions, thereby exposing us to potential expenses in exiting such distribution agreements. We, and any of our alliance partners, must also market our services in compliance with federal, state, local and international laws relating to the provision of incentives and inducements. Violation of these laws can result in substantial penalties. Therefore, if we are unable to successfully motivate and expand our marketing and sales force and further develop our sales and marketing capabilities, or if our alliance partners fail to promote our solutions, we will have difficulty increasing our revenues and the revenue may not offset the additional expense of expansion.\nThe adoption cycle of our target customers tends to be very lengthy, which has, and is expected to continue to, adversely affect our ability to increase revenues quickly.\nWe offer our solutions to companies in the life sciences industry. These companies operate within a heavily regulated environment and as such, changing vendors and distribution practices typically require a number of steps, which may include the audit of our facilities, review of our procedures, qualifying us as a vendor, and performing test shipments. This process can take several months or longer to complete, involving multiple levels of approval, prior to a company fully adopting our platform and products. The logistics management of many companies is decentralized adding to the time needed to effect adaptation of our solutions. In addition, any such adoption may be on a gradual basis such that the customer progressively ramps up use of our solutions following adoption. The slow adoption process has, and is expected to continue to, adversely affect our ability to increase revenues quickly.\nWe depend on the availability of certain component products used in our solutions; if we experience delays in the procurement of components manufactured by third parties, then we may experience customer dissatisfaction and our reputation could suffer.\nIf we fail to procure sufficient components used in our products from our third-party manufacturers, we may be unable to deliver our solutions to our customers on a timely basis, which could lead to customer dissatisfaction and could harm our reputation and ability to compete. We currently acquire various component parts for our solutions from various independent manufacturers, some of which are sole sourced. We would likely experience significant delays or cessation in producing some of these components if a labor strike, natural disaster, public health crisis or other supply disruption were to occur, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, at any of our main suppliers. If we are unable to procure a component from one of our manufacturers, we may be required to enter into arrangements with one or more alternative manufacturing companies, which may cause delays in producing components or result in significant increase in costs. To date, we have not experienced any material delay that has adversely impacted our operations, but this does not mean that we will continue to have timely access to adequate supplies of essential materials and components in the future or that supplies of these materials and components will be available on satisfactory terms when needed. If our vendors for these materials and components are unable to meet our requirements, fail to make shipments in a timely manner, or ship defective materials or components, we could experience a shortage or delay in supply or fail to meet our contractual requirements, which would adversely affect our results of operations and negatively impact our cash flow and profitability.\nWe expect to base our equipment and inventory purchasing decisions on our forecasts of customers\u2019 demand, and if our forecasts are inaccurate, our operating results could be materially harmed.\nAs our customer base increases, we expect the need to purchase additional equipment and inventory. Our forecasts will be based on multiple assumptions, each of which may cause our estimates to be inaccurate, affecting our ability to provide products to our customers. When demand for our products increases significantly, we may not be able to meet demand on a timely basis, and we may need to expend a significant amount of time working with our customers to allocate limited supply and maintain positive customer relations, or we may incur additional costs in order to rush the manufacture and delivery of additional products. If we underestimate customers\u2019 demand, we may forego revenue opportunities, lose market share and damage our customer relationships. Conversely, if we overestimate customer demand, we may purchase more equipment and inventory than we are able to use or sell at any given time or at all. As a result of our failure to properly estimate demand for our products, we could have excess or obsolete equipment and/or inventory, resulting in a decline in the value of our equipment and/or inventory, which would increase our costs of revenues and reduce our liquidity. Our failure to accurately manage our equipment purchases and inventory relative to demand would adversely affect our operating results.\nIf we suffer a loss to our factories, facilities or distribution system due to factors outside of our control our operations could be seriously harmed.\nWe rely on our distribution system including third-party shipment and carrier services to transport our shippers containing biological material. These third-party operations could be subject to natural disasters, adverse weather conditions, other business disruptions, and carrier error, which could cause delays in the delivery of our shippers, which in turn could cause serious harm to the biological material being shipped. As a result, any prolonged delay in shipment, whether due to technical difficulties, power failures, break-ins, destruction or damage to carrier facilities as a result of a natural disaster, fire, or any other reason, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, could result in damage to the contents of the shipper.\nAdditionally, our factories, facilities and distribution system may be subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, terrorism, increasing severity or frequency of extreme weather events, or other natural or man-made disasters. Certain components of our key product are manufactured in China and the extent to which our ability to produce products is affected by COVID-19 will largely continue to depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted. Additionally, we operate facilities in Irvine, California, Livingston, New Jersey, Ball Ground, Georgia, New Prague, Minnesota, Houston, Texas and Hoofddorp, Netherlands, some of which specialize in the secure storage of biological specimens, materials and samples. If natural disasters or similar events, like hurricanes, fires or explosions or large-scale accidents or power outages, were to occur that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of these facilities, damaged critical infrastructure or our customers\u2019 biological samples, or otherwise disrupted operations at such facility, this could affect our ability to maintain ongoing operations and cause us to incur significant expenses. Insurance coverage may not be adequate to fully cover losses in any particular case.\nOur products and services may expose us to liability in excess of our current insurance coverage.\nOur platform of products and services involve significant risks of liability, which may substantially exceed the revenues we derive from them. We cannot predict the magnitude of these potential liabilities. We currently maintain general liability insurance and product liability insurance. Claims may be made against us that exceed the limits of these policies.\nOur liability policy is an \u201coccurrence\u201d based policy. Thus, our policy is complete when we purchased it and following cancellation of the policy it continues to provide coverage for future claims based on conduct that took place during the policy term. Our insurance coverage, however, may not protect us against all liability because our policies typically have various exceptions to the claims covered and also require us to assume some costs of the claim even though a portion of the claim may be covered. In addition, if we expand into new markets, we may not be aware of the need for, or be able to obtain insurance coverage for such activities or, if insurance is obtained, the dollar amount of any liabilities incurred could exceed our insurance coverage. A partially or completely uninsured claim, if successful and of significant magnitude, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we use biological and hazardous materials in a manner that causes injury, we could be liable for damages.\nOur customers may ship potentially harmful biological materials in our dewars. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury to employees or third parties from the use, storage, handling or disposal of these materials. In the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources or any applicable insurance coverage we may have. Additionally, we are subject to, on an ongoing basis, federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for damages.\nWe operate in a competitive industry and if we cannot compete effectively, we will lose business.\nWe expect to continue to experience significant and increasing levels of competition in the future. While there are technological and marketing barriers to entry, we cannot guarantee that these barriers will be sufficient to defend our market share against current and future competitors. Our principal competitive considerations in our market include:\n\u25cf financial resources to allocate to proper marketing and an appropriate sales effort;\n\u25cf acceptance of our solutions model;\n\u25cf acceptance of our solutions including per use fee structures and other charges for services;\n\u25cf keeping up technologically with ongoing development of enhanced features and benefits;\n\u25cf reductions in the delivery costs of competitors\u2019 solutions;\n\u25cf the ability to develop and maintain and expand strategic alliances;\n\u25cf establishing our brand name;\n\u25cf our ability to deliver our solutions to our customers when requested;\n\u25cf our timing of introductions of new solutions, and services; and\n\u25cf financial resources to support working capital needs and required capital investments in infrastructure.\nOur future revenue stream depends to a large degree on our ability to bring new solutions and services to market on a timely basis. We generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by increased competition through frequent innovation, rapid technological changes and changing industry standards. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services may become obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results could suffer.\nThere may also be other companies which are currently developing competitive products and services or which may in the future develop technologies and products that are comparable, superior or less costly than our own. For example, some specialty couriers and packaging manufacturers with greater resources currently provide temperature controlled packaging solutions and may develop other products or solutions in the future, both of which compete with our products. A competitor that has greater resources than us may be able to develop and expand their networks and product offerings more quickly, devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their solutions and adopt more aggressive pricing policies. We may not be able to successfully compete with a competitor that has greater resources and such competition may adversely affect our business.\nIf we successfully develop products and/or services, but those products and/or services do not achieve and maintain market acceptance, our business will not be profitable.\nThe degree of acceptance of our platform of our existing products or any future products or services by our current target markets, and any other markets to which we attempt to sell our products and services, and our profitability and growth will depend on a number of factors including, among others, our shippers\u2019 ability to perform and preserve the integrity of the materials shipped, relative convenience and ease of use of our shippers and/or Cryoportal\u00ae, availability of alternative products or new technologies that make our solutions offering less desirable or competitive, pricing and cost effectiveness, effectiveness of our or our collaborators\u2019 sales and marketing strategy and the adoption cycles of our targeted customers.\nIn addition, even if our products and services achieve market acceptance, we may not be able to maintain that market acceptance over time if new products or services are introduced that are more favorably received than our products and services, are more cost effective, or render our products obsolete. Although we are not aware of any other treatments or methods currently being developed that would directly compete with the methods we employ, there can be no assurance that future developments in technology will not make our technology non-competitive or obsolete, or significantly reduce our operating margins or the demand for our offerings, or otherwise negatively impact our ability to be profitable.\nRisks Associated with Our Intellectual Property\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain patent protection for our solutions, preserve our trade secrets, and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others.\nOur policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing United States patent applications related to our technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business. Our patents or patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented in the future or the rights granted may not provide a competitive advantage. We intend to vigorously protect and defend our intellectual property. Costly and time-consuming litigation brought by us may be necessary to enforce our patents and to protect our trade secrets and know-how, or to determine the enforceability, scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others.\nWe also rely upon trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements and inventions assignment and work for hire agreements in connection with their employment, consulting, or advisory relationships. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Additionally, our competitors may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our proprietary technology, or we may not be able to meaningfully protect our rights in unpatented proprietary technology.\nWhile we are not aware of any third party that is infringing any of our patents or trademarks nor do we believe that we are infringing on the patents or trademarks of any other person or organization, we cannot guarantee that our current and potential competitors and other third parties have not filed (or in the future will not file) patent applications for (or have not received or in the future will not receive) patents or obtain additional proprietary rights that will prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use or sell our solutions either in the United States or internationally. Additionally, we may face assertions of claims by holders of patents alleging that we are infringing upon their patent rights, which claims may be without merit, but may nonetheless result in our incurring substantial costs of defense.\nWe are dependent on third parties for the continued development and maintenance of our Cryoportal\u00ae software.\nOur proprietary Cryoportal\u00ae is a logistics platform software used by our customers, business partners and client care team to automate the entry of orders, prepare customs documentation and facilitate status and location monitoring of shipped orders while in transit. The continued development of the Cryoportal\u00ae platform is in part contracted to outside software development companies. If these companies become unable or unwilling to continue work on scheduled projects, and an alternative software development company cannot be secured, we may not be able to implement needed enhancements to the system. Failure to proceed with enhancements to the system would adversely affect our ability to generate new business and serve existing customers, resulting in a reduction in revenue.\nOur customers could also become the target of litigation relating to the patent and other intellectual property rights of others.\nAny litigation relating to the intellectual property rights of others could trigger technical support and indemnification obligations in licenses or customer agreements that we may enter into. These obligations could result in substantial expenses, including the payment by us of costs and damages relating to claims of intellectual property infringement. In addition to the time and expense required for us to provide support or indemnification to our customers, any such litigation could disrupt the businesses of our customers, which in turn could hurt our relationships with such customers and cause the sale of our products to decrease. No assurance can be given that claims for indemnification will not be made, or that if made, such claims would not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial conditions.\nWe rely upon certain critical information systems, including our Cryoportal\u00ae software platform, for the operation of our business and the failure of any critical information system could adversely impact our reputation and future revenues and we may be required to increase our spending on data and system security.\nWe rely upon certain critical information systems, including our Cryoportal\u00ae software platform which is used by our customers and business partners to automate the entry of orders, prepare customs documentation and facilitate status and location monitoring of shipped orders while in transit. In addition, the provision of service to our customers and the operation of our networks and systems involve the storage and transmission of significant amounts of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data, including personal information of customers, employees and others. Our technology infrastructure and critical information systems are subject to damage or interruption from a number of potential sources, including unauthorized intrusions, cyber-attacks, software viruses or other malware, natural disasters, power failures, employee error or malfeasances and other events. Despite our best efforts, no cybersecurity or emergency recovery process is failsafe, and if our safeguards fail or our technology infrastructure or critical information systems are compromised, the safety and efficiency of our operations could be materially harmed, our reputation could suffer, and we could face additional costs, liabilities, costly legal challenges. Additionally, an actual or alleged failure to comply with applicable United States or foreign data protection regulations or other data protection standards may expose us to litigation, fines, sanctions or other penalties. We do not have cyber security insurance and we may incur significant costs in the event of a successful cyber-attack against us. The cost and operational consequences of implementing, maintaining and enhancing further data or system protection measures could increase significantly to overcome increasingly intense, complex and sophisticated global cyber threats.\nRisks Related to Regulatory and Legal Matters\nComplying with certain regulations that apply to shipments using our solutions can limit our activities and increase our cost of operations.\nShipments using our solutions and services are subject to various regulations in the various countries in which we operate. For example, shipments using our solutions may be required to comply with the shipping requirements promulgated by the Centers for Disease Control (\u201cCDC\u201d), the Occupational Safety and Health Organization (\u201cOSHA\u201d), the Department of Transportation (\u201cDOT\u201d) as well as rules established by the IATA and the ICAO. Additionally, our data logger may be subject to regulation and certification by the Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d), Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d), and the Federal Aviation Administration (\u201cFAA\u201d). We will need to ensure that our solutions and services comply with relevant rules and regulations to make our solutions and services marketable, and in some cases compliance is difficult to determine. Significant changes in such regulations could require costly changes to our solutions and services or prevent use of our shippers for an extended period of time while we seek to comply with changed regulations. If we are unable to comply with any of these rules or regulations or fail to obtain any required approvals, our ability to market our solutions and services may be adversely affected. In addition, even if we are able to comply with these rules and regulations, compliance can result in increased costs. In either event, our financial results and condition may be adversely affected. We depend on our business partners and unrelated and frequently unknown third-party agents in foreign countries to act on our behalf to complete the importation process and to make delivery of our shippers to the final user. The failure of these third parties to perform their duties could result in damage to the contents of the shipper resulting in customer dissatisfaction or liability to us, even if we are not at fault.\nChanges in U.S. trade policy, tariff and import/export regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur international operations and transactions also depend upon favorable trade relations between the United States and the foreign countries in which our customers and suppliers have operations. Changes in U.S. or international social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories or countries where we currently sell our products or conduct our business, as well as any negative sentiment toward the United States as a result of such changes, could adversely affect our business. The current U.S. presidential administration has instituted or proposed changes in trade policies that include the negotiation or termination of trade agreements, the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the United States, economic sanctions on individuals, corporations or countries, and other government regulations affecting trade between the United States and other countries where we conduct our business. It may be time consuming and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to or comply with any such changes.\nAs a result of certain policy changes of the U.S. presidential administration and from certain U.S. government proposals, there may be greater restrictions and economic disincentives on international trade. The new tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade policy could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, and certain foreign governments have instituted or are considering imposing trade sanctions on certain U.S. goods. We do a significant amount of business that would be impacted by changes to the trade policies of the United States and foreign countries (including governmental action related to tariffs, international trade agreements, or economic sanctions). Such changes have the potential to adversely impact the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof, our industry and the global demand for our products. We may not succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies to counter the foregoing factors effectively in each location where we do business and the foregoing factors may cause a reduction in our sales, profitability or cash flows, or cause an increase in our liabilities.\nWe, along with our customers, are subject to various international governmental regulations. Compliance with or changes in such regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses, and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations, we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution, and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties.\nWe, along with our customers, are subject to various significant international, federal, state and local regulations, including but not limited to regulations in the areas of health and safety, packaging, product content, employment, labor and immigration, import/export controls, trade restrictions and anti-competition. In addition, as a global organization, we are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal, sensitive and/or patient health data in the course of our business. The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which became effective in May 2018, applies to our activities related to products and services that we offer to EU customers and workers. The GDPR established new requirements regarding the handling of personal data and includes significant penalties for non-compliance (including possible fines of up to 4 percent of total company revenue). Other governmental authorities around the world have passed or are considering similar types of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. Each of these privacy, security and data protection laws and regulations could impose significant limitations and increase our cost of providing our products and services where we process end user personal data and could harm our results of operations and expose us to significant fines, penalties and other damages.\nWe must also comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, anti-competition regulations and sanctions imposed by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control and other similar laws and regulations. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our ability to attract and retain employees, our international operations, our business and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies.\nThese regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy any violations of these regulations. Any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in the cessation of our operations or portions of our operations, product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations. In addition, because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries, we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products. Any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products, force us to modify our products to comply with new regulations or increase our costs of producing these products. If demand for our products is adversely affected or our costs increase, our operating results and business would suffer.\nWe are subject to regulation by the FDA or certain similar foreign regulatory agencies, and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain of our operations are subject to regulation by the FDA or similar foreign regulatory agencies. For example, we are aware that China\u2019s National Medical Products Administration has had discussions that may require certain of our products to be registered as Class II medical devices. In addition, we may in the future develop products that are subject to regulation as medical devices by the FDA and similar foreign regulatory agencies. The regulations enforced by the FDA and similar regulatory agencies govern a wide variety of product-related activities, including the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, clearance, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, pricing, and export and import of pharmaceutical products. If we or any of our customers, suppliers or distributors fail to comply with FDA and other applicable regulatory requirements or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply, we may face, among other things, warning letters; adverse publicity affecting both us and our customers; investigations or notices of non-compliance, fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; import or export restrictions; partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions; increased difficulty in obtaining required FDA clearances or approvals or foreign equivalents; seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers; or the inability to sell our products. Any such FDA or other regulatory agency actions could disrupt our business and operations, lead to significant remedial costs and have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition\nHistorically, we have incurred significant losses and we may incur losses in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $192 million. In order to achieve and sustain revenue growth in the future, we must expand our market presence and revenues from existing and new customers. We may continue to incur losses in the future and may never generate revenues sufficient to become profitable or to sustain profitability. Continuing losses may impair our ability to raise the additional capital required to continue and expand our operations.\nOur indebtedness and liabilities could limit the cash flow available for our operations, expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $169.7 million of indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, on a consolidated basis. We may also incur additional indebtedness to meet future financing needs. Our indebtedness could have significant negative consequences for our security holders and our business, results of operations and financial condition by, among other things:\n\u25cf increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u25cf limiting our ability to obtain additional financing;\n\u25cf requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our\n\u25cf indebtedness, which will reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes;\n\u25cf limiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business;\n\u25cf diluting the interests of our existing stockholders as a result of issuing shares of our common stock upon\n\u25cf conversion of the notes; and\n\u25cf placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with competitors that are less leveraged than us or have\n\u25cf better access to capital.\nOur business may not generate sufficient funds, and we may otherwise be unable to maintain sufficient cash reserves, to pay amounts due under our indebtedness, including our 3.00% convertible senior notes due 2025 (the \u201cConvertible Senior Notes\u201d), and our cash needs may increase in the future. In addition, any future indebtedness that we may incur may contain financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to operate our business, raise capital or make payments under our other indebtedness. If we fail to comply with these covenants or to make payments under our indebtedness when due, then we would be in default under that indebtedness, which could, in turn, result in that and our other indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future, and if we are unable to secure adequate funds on terms acceptable to us, we could be unable to execute our business plan.\nTo remain competitive, we must continue to make investments in the development and broadening of our platform of solutions, the expansion of our sales and marketing activities, and the expansion of our global logistics operations infrastructure as we increase sales domestically and internationally. If cash on hand, short-term investment and cash generated from our operations is insufficient to fund such growth, we could be required to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities in the public or private markets, or through a collaborative arrangement. Any future issuance of equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities could result in substantial dilution to our stockholders, and the securities issued in such a financing could have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock. In addition, if we raise additional funds through debt financing, we could be subject to debt covenants that place limitations on our operations. We may not be able to raise additional capital on reasonable terms, or at all, or we could use capital more rapidly than anticipated. If we cannot raise the required capital when needed, we may not be able to satisfy the demands of existing and prospective customers, we could lose revenue and market share and we may have to curtail our capital expenditures. A number of factors including market conditions, our results of operations, the perception of our business in the capital markets and our business prospects, among others, could affect our ability to obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all.\nIf we are unable to obtain sufficient capital in the future, we could have to curtail our capital expenditures. Any curtailment of our capital expenditures could result in a reduction in net revenue, reduced quality of our products, increased manufacturing costs for our products, harm to our reputation, or reduced manufacturing efficiencies and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Preferred Stock\nThe issuance of shares of our Series C Preferred Stock reduces the relative voting power of holders of our Common Stock, dilutes the ownership of such holders, and may adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\nIn connection with financing our acquisition of MVE Biological Solutions, we completed the sale of 250,000 shares of a newly designated Series C Preferred Stock, par value $0.001, at a price of $1,000 per share, the original purchase price, to funds affiliated with The Blackstone Group Inc., or Blackstone. The holders of our Series C Preferred Stock are entitled to dividends at a rate of 4.0% per annum, paid-in-kind, accruing daily and paid quarterly in arrears and are also entitled to participate in dividends declared or paid on the Common Stock on an as-converted basis.\nThe holder of our Series C Preferred Stock has the right, at its option, to convert its Series C Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, into Common Stock at a conversion price equal to $38.6152 per share subject to certain customary adjustments. After October 1, 2022, subject to certain conditions, we may, at our option, require conversion of all of the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock to Common Stock if, for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date we notify the Series C Preferred Stockholders of the election to convert, the closing price of our Common Stock is at least 150% of the conversion price. On February 5, 2021, the Company received a waiver and conversion notice from Blackstone Freeze Parent L.P. and Blackstone Tactical Opportunities Fund - FD L.P. and converted an aggregate of 50,000 shares of the Company\u2019s 4.0% Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, resulting in the issuance of an aggregate of 1,312,860 shares of Common Stock.\nSimilarly, as it relates to our Convertible Senior Notes, at any time before the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately before June 1, 2025, the holders of our Convertible Senior Notes may convert their notes into shares of Common Stock, together, if applicable, with cash in lieu of any fractional share, at the then-applicable conversion rate. The initial conversion rate is 41.8261 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $23.91 per share of common stock. The conversion rate and conversion price will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events.\nAny conversion of shares of the Series C Preferred Stock or the Convertible Senior Notes to shares of our Common Stock would dilute the ownership interest of existing holders of our Common Stock, and any sale in the public market of shares of our Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock or the Convertible Senior Notes could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our Common Stock. We granted the Preferred Stock Investors and the holders of the Convertible Senior Notes customary registration rights in respect of their securities. These registration rights facilitate the resale of such securities into the public market, and any such resale would increase the number of shares of our Common Stock available for public trading.\nThe Series C Preferred Stockholders may exercise influence over us, including through their ability to designate a member of our board of directors.\nThe Series C Preferred Stockholders are generally entitled to vote with the holders of the shares of Common Stock on all matters submitted for a vote of holders of shares of Common Stock (voting together with the holders of shares of Common Stock as one class) on an as-converted basis, subject to certain NASDAQ voting limitations, if applicable. Additionally, the consent of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock is required for so long as any shares of the Series C Preferred Stock remain outstanding for (i) amendments to the Company\u2019s organizational documents that have an adverse effect on the holders of Series C Preferred Stock and (ii) issuances by the Company of securities that are senior to, or equal in priority with, the Series C Preferred Stock, including any shares of the Company\u2019s Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock. In addition, for so long as 75% of the Series C Preferred Stock issued in connection with the Securities Purchase Agreement remains outstanding, consent of the Holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock will be required for (i) any voluntary dissolution, liquidation, bankruptcy, winding up or deregistration or delisting and (ii) incurrence by Cryoport of any indebtedness unless our ratio of debt to LTM EBITDA (as defined in the Series C Certificate of Designation) would be less than a ratio of 5-to-1 on a pro forma basis giving effect to such incurrence and the use of proceeds therefrom.\nAdditionally, an affiliate of Blackstone has the right to nominate for election one member to our board of directors for so long as certain parties hold 66.67% of the Series C Preferred Stock issued in the Blackstone financing transaction. The director designated by Blackstone is entitled to serve on committees of our board of directors, subject to applicable law and NASDAQ rules. Notwithstanding the fact that all directors will be subject to fiduciary duties to us and to applicable law, the interests of the director designated by Blackstone may differ from the interests of our security holders as a whole or of our other directors.\nAs a result, the Series C Preferred Stockholders have the ability to influence the outcome of certain matters affecting our governance and capitalization. The sponsors of the Series C Preferred Stockholders are in the business of making or advising on investments in companies, including businesses that may directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business, and they may have interests that diverge from, or even conflict with, those of our other shareholders. They may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. Our obligations to the holders of Series C Preferred Stock could also limit our ability to obtain additional financing or increase our borrowing costs, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nOur Series C Preferred Stock has rights, preferences, and privileges that are not held by, and are preferential to, the rights of holders of our Common Stock, which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.\nThe holders have the right under the Series C Certificate of Designation to receive a liquidation preference entitling them to be paid an amount per share equal to the greater of (i) the original purchase price, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends and (ii) the amount that the holder would have been entitled to receive at such time if the Series C Preferred Stock were converted into Common Stock. In addition, the holders are entitled to dividends at a rate of 4.0% per annum, paid-in-kind, accruing daily and paid quarterly in arrears. The holders are also entitled to participate in dividends declared or paid on the Common Stock on an as-converted basis.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nCertain of our existing stockholders own and have the right to acquire a substantial number of shares of common stock.\nAs of February 19, 2021, our directors, executive officers and beneficial owners of 5% or more of our outstanding common stock beneficially owned 24,274,179 shares of common stock assuming their exercise of all outstanding Series C Preferred Stock and options that are exercisable within 60 days of February 19, 2021 or approximately 48.6 % of our outstanding common stock. As such, the concentration of beneficial ownership of our common stock may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of Cryoport and may adversely affect the voting or other rights of other holders of our common stock.\nThe sale of substantial shares of our common stock may depress our stock price.\nAs of February 19, 2021, there were 45,581,661 shares of our common stock outstanding. Substantially all of these shares of common stock are eligible for trading in the public market. The market price of our common stock may decline if our stockholders sell a large number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the market perceives that such sales may occur. We could also issue up to an additional 8,399,909 shares of our common stock upon exercise of outstanding options or reserved for future issuance under our stock incentive plans, up to an additional 5,260,162 shares of our common stock upon conversion of Series C Preferred Stock , and up to an additional 4,810,002 shares of our common stock upon conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes.\nOur stock price has been and will likely continue to be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has been highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to technological innovations or new solutions and services by us or our competitors, additions or departures of key personnel, sales of our common stock, our ability to execute our business plan, our operating results being below expectations, loss of any strategic relationship, industry developments, economic and other external factors and period-to-period fluctuations in our financial results.\nIn addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and warrants.\nWe are at risk of securities class action litigation.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities. This risk is especially relevant for us because our stock price and those of other biotechnology and life sciences companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years. If we face such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could harm our business. We do maintain insurance, but the coverage may not be sufficient and may not be available in all instances.\nWe have not paid dividends on our common stock in the past and do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. Any return on investment may be limited to the value of our common stock.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends on our common stock will depend on our earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting us at such time as the Board of Directors may consider the payment of any such dividends. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because a return on your investment will only occur if the price of our common stock appreciates.\nOur Articles of Incorporation allows our Board of Directors to issue up to 2,500,000 shares of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock.\nOur Articles of Incorporation allows our board of directors to issue up to 2,500,000 shares of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, without action by our stockholders. We have designated 800,000 shares as Class A Preferred Stock, 585,000 shares as Class B Preferred Stock and 250,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock, of which 200,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock are issued and outstanding at February 19, 2021. Without limiting the foregoing, (i) such shares of preferred stock could have liquidation rights that are senior to the liquidation preference applicable to our common stock and Preferred Stock, (ii) such shares of preferred stock could have voting or conversion rights, which could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock and Preferred Stock and (iii) the ownership interest of holders of our common stock will be diluted following the issuance of any such shares of preferred stock. In addition, the issuance of such shares of blank check preferred stock could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control of our Company.\nProvisions in our bylaws and Nevada law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our Company or changes in our management and, as a result, may depress the trading price of our common stock.\nProvisions of our bylaws and Nevada law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares of our common stock. The relevant bylaw provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions include advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations, and the ability of our Board of Directors to make, alter or repeal our bylaws.\nAbsent approval of our Board of Directors, our bylaws may only be amended or repealed by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of our outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote.\nIn addition, Section 78.438 of the Nevada Revised Statutes prohibits a publicly-held Nevada corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder (generally defined as a person which together with its affiliates owns, or within the last three years has owned, 10% of our voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder) unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nThe existence of the foregoing provisions and other potential anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our Company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your common stock in an acquisition.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur ability to grow and compete in our industry will be hampered if we are unable to retain the continued service of our key professionals or to identify, hire and retain additional qualified professionals.\nOur success in implementing our business strategy depends largely on the skills, experience and performance of key members of our executive management team and others in key management positions. The collective efforts of each of these persons working as a team will be critical to us as we continue to develop our technologies, tests and engineering and development and sales programs. As a result of the difficulty in locating qualified new management, the loss or incapacity of existing members of our executive management team could adversely affect our operations. If we were to lose one or more of these key employees, we could experience difficulties in finding qualified successors, competing effectively, developing our technologies and implementing our business strategy. We do not maintain \"key person\" insurance on any of our employees.\nIn addition, a critical factor to our business is our ability to attract and retain qualified professionals including key employees and consultants. We are continually at risk of losing current professionals or being unable to hire additional professionals as needed. If we are unable to attract new qualified employees, our ability to grow will be adversely affected. If we are unable to retain current employees or strategic consultants, our financial condition and ability to maintain operations may be adversely affected.\nIf equity research analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business. We do not control these analysts. The price of our common stock could decline if one or more equity analyst downgrades our stock or if analysts downgrade our stock or issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business.", "PERMNO": 15506, "SIC": 3842, "TIC": "CYRX"}
