{"cik": "1031623", "company": "GULF ISLAND FABRICATION INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements (see \u201cCautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Information\u201d). These risk factors are important to understanding other statements in this Report. The following information should be read in conjunction with Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and Item 8 \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d found elsewhere in this Report, which may include additional factors that could adversely affect our business. References to \u201cNotes\u201d relate to the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements (\u201cFinancial Statements\u201d) in Item 8.\nOur business, prospects, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and stock price may be affected materially and adversely, in whole or in part, by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause our actual financial condition, operating results and cash flows to vary materially from historical results or those anticipated, projected or assumed in our forward-looking statements. Further, new risks emerge from time to time. In addition, our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and stock price could be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies generally which are not specifically mentioned below.\nBusiness and Industry Risks\nThe ongoing global pandemic caused by COVID-19, including new and emerging strains and variants, and any future major public health crisis, including any pandemic, epidemic or other disease outbreak, and any resulting negative impact on the global economy and financial markets could have a negative impact on our operations, the duration and extent of which is highly uncertain and could be material.\nThe extent and duration of adverse impacts that the COVID-19 pandemic (including new and emerging strains and variants) may have on our backlog and bidding activities, on our suppliers, subcontractors, customers and employees and on global financial markets, including global oil markets, is unknown, but could be both material and prolonged. Similarly, any future major public health crisis, including any pandemic, epidemic or other disease outbreak could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, for several years, the price of oil experienced significant volatility, which resulted in reductions in capital spending and drilling activities from our traditional offshore oil and gas customer base. Consequently, our operating results and cash flows were negatively impacted from reductions in revenue, lower margins due to competitive pricing, under-utilization of our operating facilities and resources, and losses on certain projects. COVID-19 added another layer of pressure and uncertainty on oil prices and our end markets, which further impacted our operations during 2021 and 2020 and could impact our operations going forward. In addition, our operations (as well as the operations of our customers, subcontractors and other counterparties) were negatively impacted by the physical distancing, quarantine and isolation measures recommended by national, state and local authorities on large portions of the population, and mandatory business closures that were enacted in an attempt to control the spread of COVID-19, and which could be reenacted in response to new and emerging strains and variants of COVID-19 or any future major public health crisis.\nThe ultimate business and financial impacts of oil price volatility and COVID-19 on our business and results of operations continues to be uncertain, but the impacts have included, or may include, among other things, reduced bidding activity, suspension or termination of backlog, deterioration of customer financial condition, potential supply interruptions, and unanticipated project costs due to project disruptions and schedule delays; material price increases; lower labor productivity, increased employee and contractor absenteeism and turnover, including in connection with any government or customer-imposed COVID-19 vaccination or testing requirements, and craft labor hiring challenges; lack of performance by subcontractors and suppliers; and contract disputes. These and other impacts of COVID-19, or any future major public health crisis or events, including the impact of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, could have a material adverse impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur revenue and profitability may be impacted by the cyclical nature of the oil and gas industry and other energy-related industries.\nOur business is significantly dependent on the level of capital expenditures by oil and gas producers, processors and their contractors, as well as alternative energy companies, operating in the GOM and along the Gulf Coast. The level of activity by these companies can be impacted by volatility in oil and gas and associated commodity prices. In addition to commodity prices, the levels of our customers\u2019 capital expenditures are influenced by, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe cost of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and gas;\n\u2022\nthe ability of oil and gas companies to generate capital;\n\u2022\nthe sale and expiration dates of offshore leases in the U.S. and overseas;\n\u2022\nthe discovery rate, size and location of new oil and gas reserves;\n\u2022\ndemand for energy, including hydrocarbon production, which is affected by worldwide economic activity and population growth;\n\u2022\nthe ability of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) to set and maintain production levels for oil and the level of production by non-OPEC countries;\n\u2022\nlocal, federal and international military, political and economic events and conditions, including regulatory changes under the current administration and Congress, economic uncertainty, socio-political unrest, any government shutdown and instability or hostilities and the current situation in Ukraine and trade and monetary sanctions in response to such developments;\n\u2022\ndemand for, availability of and technological viability of, alternative sources of energy (especially in light of regulatory changes under the current administration and Congress);\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting energy exploration, production, transportation and consumption; and\n\u2022\nuncertainty regarding the U.S. energy policy under the current administration and Congress, particularly any revision, reinterpretation or creation of environmental and tax laws and regulations that would negatively impact or restrict the oil and gas industry.\nThe above factors have suppressed capital spending by offshore oil and gas companies in recent years. Capital spending within the oil and gas industry has also been impacted by certain geopolitical developments in addition to COVID-19. Further, previous reductions in, and ongoing volatility of, oil and gas prices has impacted the timing of, and our ability to secure, new project awards. While industry conditions are improving, if they do not continue to improve, these challenges may continue to impact our ability to operate our fabrication facilities at desired utilization levels and may result in ongoing low utilization levels, decreased revenue, lower margins, and losses in future periods. In addition, we believe that the previous downturn in the oil and gas industry has also adversely impacted many of our customers' businesses.\nWe are unable to predict future oil and gas prices or the level of oil and gas industry activity for the products and services we provide. Further, the current increase in oil and gas prices may not necessarily translate into immediate or long-term increased activity, and even during periods of relatively high oil prices, our customers may cancel or curtail programs, or reduce their levels of capital expenditures for exploration and production and repair and maintenance of their offshore assets. Advances in onshore exploration and development technologies, particularly with respect to large, onshore shale production areas, could result in our historical customers allocating a higher percentage of their capital expenditure budgets to onshore exploration and production activities and we may not be successful securing new project awards related to these onshore activities. In addition, the current increase in gas prices could also negatively impact future investments in petrochemical and other facilities that benefit from lower gas prices. These factors could cause our revenue and margins to remain depressed and limit our future growth opportunities. See \u201cOverview\u201d in Item 7 for further discussion of the impacts of reductions and volatility in crude oil prices.\nWe operate in an industry that is highly competitive.\nThe onshore refining, petrochemical, LNG and industrial fabrication industries and the offshore oil and gas fabrication and services industry are highly competitive and influenced by events largely outside of our control. In addition, as we seek fabrication opportunities related to rapidly growing energy transition initiatives, including in support of our customers who are making energy transitions away from fossil fuels, opportunities related to offshore wind developments and potential future onshore support structures to provide electricity from renewable and green sources, we expect to face increased competition. Contracts for our services are often awarded on a competitively bid basis, and our customers consider many factors when awarding a project. These factors include price, ability to meet the customer\u2019s schedule, the availability and capacity of personnel, equipment and facilities, and the reputation, experience, and safety record of the contractor. We can provide no assurances that we will be able to maintain our current competitive position or that we will be able to successfully compete against other fabrication companies in the highly competitive green energy transition. In addition, we often compete with companies that have greater resources, which may make them more competitive for certain projects.\nCompetition with foreign competitors can also be challenging as such competitors often have lower operating costs and lower wage rates, and foreign governments often use subsidies and incentives to create local jobs and impose import duties and fees on products. In addition, technological innovations have lowered transportation costs, increasing the competitiveness of foreign competitors when exporting structures from foreign locations to the GOM and Gulf Coast, which may hinder our ability to successfully secure new awards for projects destined for the GOM and Gulf Coast from foreign locations. See \u201cCompetition\u201d within Item 1 for further discussion of the competitive nature of our industry.\nA small number of customers may represent a significant portion of our revenue.\nWe derive a significant amount of our revenue from a small number of customers, including U.S. and, to a lesser extent, international energy producers; refining, petrochemical, LNG, industrial and power operators; and EPC companies. Because the level of services that we may provide to any customer depends on, among other things, the amount of that customer\u2019s capital expenditure budget and our ability to meet the customer\u2019s delivery schedule, customers that account for a significant portion of our revenue in one year may represent an immaterial portion of revenue in subsequent years. We define significant customers as those that individually comprise 10% or more of our consolidated revenue. For 2021 and 2020, two and three customers, respectively, accounted for 54% and 51%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue. The loss of a significant customer in any given year for any reason, including a sustained decline in that customer\u2019s capital expenditure budget or competitive factors, could result in a substantial loss of revenue. See \u201cCustomers\u201d in Item 1 for further discussion of our customers.\nCompetitive pricing common in the fabrication industry could negatively impact our operating results.\nEven when industry conditions are favorable, we operate in a very competitive industry, and as a result, we are not always successful in fully recovering our project costs or realizing a profit. Additionally, during periods of increased market demand, a significant amount of new service capacity may enter the market, which also places pressure on the pricing of our services. Furthermore, during periods of declining pricing for our services, we may not be able to reduce our costs accordingly, which could further affect our profitability.\nOur traditional customer base is facing significant challenges and a period of consolidation within their industry.\nThe oil and gas industry continues to face significant challenges due to the prolonged period of depressed and/or volatile oil and gas prices from 2014 to 2018 and ongoing volatility in oil and gas prices, which were exacerbated by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Accordingly, many companies are unable to compete and, in some cases, are unable to pay their liabilities as they become due. This has resulted in many companies within the oil and gas industry seeking bankruptcy protection or pursuing consolidation through mergers with, or acquisition by, other companies. During 2020, one of our customers filed for and emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy; however, our dispute with the customer relating to the construction of two MPSVs is ongoing. See Note 10 and \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d in Item 3 for further discussion of the MPSV dispute.\nThe continued consolidation of the oil and gas industry (such as the consolidation of one or more of our primary customers, the acquisition of one or more of our primary customers by a company that is not a customer, a primary customer\u2019s acquisition of another company that provides services similar to those provided by us or the liquidation of one or more of our primary customers) could result in a further reduction of capital spending and decrease in the demand for our products and services by our current customer base. We can provide no assurances that we will be able to maintain our level of revenue with a customer that has consolidated or replace lost revenue. We are unable to predict what effect consolidations in the offshore oil and gas industry may have on contract pricing, capital spending by our customers, our selling strategies, our competitive position, our ability to retain customers or our ability to negotiate favorable agreements with our customers.\nOperational Risks\nWe depend on the award of new contracts and the timing of those awards.\nIt is difficult to predict whether or when we will be awarded a new contract due to complex bidding and selection processes, changes in existing or forecast market conditions, governmental regulations, permitting and environmental matters. Bidding activities for several new project opportunities have been delayed or suspended as a result of COVID-19 and volatile oil and gas prices, and may be exacerbated by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and the U.S. and other countries actions in response, which, among other things, has caused further volatility in oil and gas prices. While we have seen an increase in bidding activities, we have not secured any large new project awards as a result of such activities, and we can provide no assurances that the higher level of bidding activity will continue during 2022 and beyond. In addition, political events within the U.S. have resulted in, and may continue to result in, the shutdown of government services, which could impact inspections, regulatory review and certifications, grants or approvals. Because our revenue is derived from new project awards, our results of operations and cash flows can fluctuate materially from period to period as contracts are typically awarded on a project-by-project basis.\nThe timing of new project awards may reduce our short-term profitability as we balance our current capacity with expectations of future project awards. If an expected new project award is delayed or not received, we may incur costs to maintain an idle workforce and facilities, or alternatively, we may determine that our long-term interests are best served by reducing our workforce and incurring increased costs associated with termination benefits. A reduction in our workforce could also impact our results of operations if customers are hesitant to award new contracts based upon our staffing levels or if we are unable to adequately increase our labor force and staff projects that are awarded subsequent to workforce reductions. See the risk factor below titled \u201cWe may be unable to employ a sufficient number of skilled personnel to execute our projects.\u201d\nThe nature of our contracting terms for our contracts could adversely affect our operating results.\nA substantial number of our projects are performed on a fixed-price or unit-rate basis. Under fixed-price contracts, our contract price is fixed, and is generally only subject to adjustment for changes in scope by the customer. Accordingly, we retain cost savings realized on a project but are also responsible for cost overruns. Under unit rate contracts, material items or labor tasks are assigned unit rates of measure. The unit rates of measure will generally be a reimbursable value per ton, per foot or square foot or per item installed. A typical unit rate contract can contain hundreds to thousands of unit rates of measure. Profit margins are incorporated into the unit rates and, similar to a fixed-price contract, we retain cost savings realized on a project but are also responsible for cost overruns. In many cases, our fixed-price and unit rate contracts involve complex design and engineering, significant procurement of materials and equipment, and extensive project management. In addition, as projects increase or decrease in scope, the resulting changes in contract price or unit rates could be less than the actual costs incurred associated with such changes in scope. We employ our best efforts to properly estimate the cost to complete our projects; however, our actual costs incurred could materially exceed our estimates. The revenue, costs and profit realized on a contract will often vary from the estimated amounts on which such contract was originally estimated due to the following:\n\u2022\nfailure to properly estimate costs of engineering, materials, components, equipment, labor or subcontractors;\n\u2022\nunanticipated changes in the costs of engineering, materials, components, equipment, labor or subcontractors;\n\u2022\nfailure to properly estimate the impact of engineering delays or errors on the construction of a project, including productivity, schedule and rework;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in engaging third-party subcontractors, equipment manufacturers or materials suppliers, or failures by third-party subcontractors, equipment manufacturers or materials suppliers to perform, resulting in project delays and additional costs;\n\u2022\nlate delivery of materials by our vendors or the inability of subcontractors to deliver contracted services on schedule or at the agreed upon price;\n\u2022\nincreased costs due to poor project execution or productivity and/or weather conditions;\n\u2022\nunanticipated costs or claims, including costs for project modifications, delays, errors or changes in specifications or designs, regulatory changes or contract termination;\n\u2022\nunrecoverable costs associated with customer changes in scope and schedule;\n\u2022\npayment of liquidated damages due to a failure to meet contracted delivery dates;\n\u2022\nchanges in labor conditions, including the availability, wage and productivity of labor;\n\u2022\ntermination, temporary suspension or significant reduction in scope of our projects by our customers;\n\u2022\nunanticipated technical problems with the structures, equipment or systems we supply;\n\u2022\nunder-utilization of our facilities and an idle labor force; and\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic conditions.\nThese variations and risks are inherent within our industry and may result in revenue and profit that differ from amounts originally estimated or result in losses on projects. Depending on the size of a project, variations from estimated contract performance can have a significant impact on our operating results. In addition, substantially all of our contracts require us to continue work in accordance with the contractually agreed schedule, and thus, continue to incur expenses for labor and materials, notwithstanding the occurrence of a disagreement with a customer over changes in scope, increased pricing and/or unresolved change orders or claims.\nOur backlog is subject to change as a result of delay, suspension, termination or an increase or decrease in scope for projects currently in backlog.\nThe revenue projected in our backlog may not be realized or, if realized, may not be profitable. Projects included in our backlog are generally subject to delay, suspension, termination, or an increase or decrease in scope at the option of the customer. Depending on the size of the project, the delay, suspension, termination, increase or decrease in scope of any project could significantly impact our backlog and change the expected amount and timing of revenue recognized. Further, for certain projects we may be at greater risk of delays (or further delays, as applicable), suspensions and cancellations in light of the ongoing global pandemic caused by COVID-19 and the current volatile oil and gas price environment, which has been exacerbated by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and the U.S. and other countries actions in response. In addition, where a project proceeds as scheduled, it is possible that the customer may default by failing to pay amounts owed to us. Accordingly, our backlog as of any date is an uncertain indicator of future results of operations. See \u201cNew Project Awards and Backlog\u201d in Item 7 for further discussion of our new project awards and backlog.\nWe may be unable to successfully defend against claims made against us by customers or subcontractors, or recover claims made by us against customers or subcontractors.\nOur projects are generally complex, and we may encounter difficulties in design, engineering, schedule changes and other factors, some of which may be beyond our control, that affect our ability to complete projects in accordance with contracted delivery schedules or to otherwise meet contractual performance obligations. We may bring claims against customers for additional costs incurred by us resulting from customer-caused delays or changes in project scope initiated by our customers that are not part of the original contract scope. In addition, claims may be brought against us by customers relating to, among other things, alleged defective or incomplete work, breaches of warranty and/or late completion of work. We may also incur claims with our subcontractors that are similar to those described above. These claims may be subject to lengthy and/or expensive litigation or arbitration proceedings and may require us to invest significant working capital in projects to cover cost increases pending resolution of the claims. See Note 10 and \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d in Item 3 for further discussion of our ongoing dispute with a customer related to the construction of two MPSVs.\nThe limits on our insurance coverage could expose us to potentially significant liability and costs.\nThe fabrication of structures and the services we provide involves operating hazards that can cause accidents resulting in personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, and suspension of operations. In addition, due to the proximity to the GOM, our facilities are subject to the possibility of physical damage caused by hurricanes or flooding. For example, most recently Hurricane Ida damaged our buildings, equipment and vessels under construction and in our possession, at our facilities in Houma, Louisiana, which could result in material repair or replacement costs in excess of our deductible amounts. We may incur additional costs beyond such amounts if damages are determined to be in excess of insurance coverage amounts or if costs we believed to be covered by our insurance coverages are ultimately not covered. See the risk factor below titled \u201cWe are susceptible to adverse weather conditions in our market areas\u201d for further discussion of the impacts of adverse weather conditions to our operations.\nFurther, our employees may engage in certain activities that are covered by the provisions of the Jones Act or USL&H, including services conducted on offshore platforms, services performed on barges owned or chartered by us, and construction activities associated with marine vessels that are performed at our facilities. These laws make the liability limits established under state workers\u2019 compensation laws inapplicable to these employees and, instead, permit them or their representatives to pursue actions against us for damages or job-related injuries, with generally no limitations on our potential liability. Our ownership and operation of vessels and our fabrication and repair of customer vessels can also give rise to large and varied liability risks, such as risks of collisions with other vessels or structures, sinking, fires and other marine casualties, which can result in significant claims for damages against both us and third parties. Litigation arising from any such occurrences may result in our being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting large claims.\nWe may be exposed to future losses through our use of deductibles and self-insured retentions for our exposures related to third party liability and workers' compensation. We expect liabilities in excess of any deductible to be covered by insurance. Although we believe that our insurance coverages are adequate, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance at rates we consider reasonable or that our insurance coverages will be adequate to cover claims that may arise. To the extent we are self-insured, reserves are recorded based upon our estimates, with input from legal and insurance advisors. Changes in assumptions, as well as changes in actual experience, could cause these estimates to change.\nChanges in the insurance industry have generally led to higher insurance costs and decreased availability of coverage. The availability of insurance that covers risks we typically insure against may decrease, and the insurance that we are able to obtain may have higher deductibles, higher premiums and more restrictive policy terms.\nSystems and information technology interruption or failure and data security breaches could adversely impact our ability to operate or expose us to significant financial losses and reputational harm.\nWe rely heavily on computer information, communications technology and related systems in order to properly operate our business. From time to time, we experience occasional system interruptions and delays. In the event we are unable to deploy software and hardware, effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure, and take other steps to maintain or improve the efficiency and efficacy of our systems, the operation of such systems could be interrupted or result in the loss, corruption or release of data. In addition, our computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by natural disasters, force majeure events, telecommunications failures, power loss, acts of war or terrorism, physical or electronic security breaches, intentional or inadvertent user misuse or error, or similar events or disruptions. Any of these or other events could cause interruptions, delays, loss of critical and/or sensitive data or similar effects.\nIn addition, we face the threat to our computer systems of unauthorized access, computer hackers, computer viruses, malicious code, organized cyber-attacks and other security problems and system disruptions. Further, we may see an increase in efforts by individuals or groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, such as state-sponsored organizations or nation-states, to launch coordinated attacks, such as retaliatory cyber-attacks stemming from Russia\u2019s recent invasion of Ukraine. If we were to be subject to a cyber incident or attack, it could result in the disclosure of confidential or proprietary customer information, theft, loss, corruption or misappropriation of intellectual property, damage to our reputation with our customers and the market, failure to meet customer requirements or customer dissatisfaction, theft, exposure to litigation, damage to equipment and other financial costs and losses. We rely on industry accepted security measures and technology to securely maintain all confidential and proprietary information on our computer systems, but these systems are still vulnerable to these threats. In addition, as cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of these system disruptions and security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these disruptions and breaches.\nWe may conduct a portion of our operations through joint ventures and strategic alliances over which we may have limited control, and our partners in such arrangements may not perform.\nWe may conduct a portion of our operations through joint ventures and strategic alliances with business partners. In any such arrangement, differences in views among the participants may result in delayed decisions or in failures to reach agreement on certain matters, or to do so in a timely manner. In any joint venture or strategic alliance in which we hold a non-controlling interest, we may have limited control over many decisions relating to joint venture operations and internal controls relating to operations. We also cannot control the actions of our partners, including any non-performance, default, or bankruptcy of our partners, and we would likely share liability or have joint and/or several liability with our partners for joint venture matters.\nFinancial Risks\nWe are exposed to the credit risks of our customers, including nonpayment and nonperformance by our customers.\nThe concentration of our customers in the oil and gas industry may impact our overall exposure to credit risk as customers may be similarly affected by prolonged changes in economic and industry conditions. We believe certain of our customers finance their activities through cash flows from operations and debt or equity financing. Many of these customers are facing significant challenges due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the current volatility in the oil and gas market, which has been exacerbated by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and the U.S. and other countries actions in response, and have experienced decreased cash flows, reductions in borrowing capacity, the inability to access capital or credit markets, and reductions in liquidity, which may impact their ability to pay or otherwise perform on their obligations to us. Accordingly, our operations could be impacted due to nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and do not generally require collateral in support of our trade receivables. While we maintain reserves for potential credit losses, we can provide no assurances that such reserves will be sufficient to cover uncollectible receivable amounts or that our losses from such receivables will be consistent with our expectations.\nFurthermore, some of our customers may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating and regulatory risks, which increases the risk that they may default on their obligations to us. To the extent one or more of our key customers is in financial distress or commences bankruptcy proceedings, contracts with, or obligations from, these customers may be subject to renegotiation or rejection under applicable provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and similar international laws. During 2020, one of our customers filed for and emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy; however, our dispute with the customer relating to the construction of two MPSVs is ongoing. See Note 10 and \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d in Item 3 for further discussion of our MPSV dispute.\nOur method of accounting for revenue using the percentage-of-completion method could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nRevenue and gross profit for contracts accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method can be significantly affected by changes in estimated cost to complete such contracts. Significant estimates impacting the cost to complete a contract include: forecast costs of engineering, materials, equipment and subcontracts; forecast costs of labor and labor productivity; schedule durations, including subcontractor and supplier progress; contract disputes, including claims; achievement of contractual performance requirements; and contingency, among others. The cumulative impact of revisions in total cost estimates during the progress of work is reflected in the period in which these changes become known, including, to the extent required, the reversal of profit recognized in prior periods and the recognition of losses expected to be incurred on contracts. Due to the various estimates inherent in our contract accounting, actual results could differ from those estimates, which could result in material changes to our Financial Statements and related disclosures. See Note 2 and \u201cCritical Accounting Policies\u201d in Item 7 for further discussion of our contracting and revenue recognition.\nWe may need to obtain debt financing or credit facilities or raise equity capital in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, contract commitments and/or acquisitions, and we may not be able to do so or do so on favorable terms, which would impair our ability to operate our business or execute our strategy.\nOur primary sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents and scheduled maturities of our short-term investments. If such amounts and cash flows from operating activities are not sufficient to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures, contract commitments, and/or acquisition opportunities, we would be required to reduce our capital expenditures and/or forego certain contracts and/or acquisition opportunities, or we would be required to fund such needs through debt or equity issuances or through other financing alternatives, including the sale of assets.\nWe may be required to make capital investments in our existing or new facilities and increase our working capital to support our backlog or new project awards. The capital outlays and working capital required by us to execute such projects could exceed our existing, cash, cash equivalents, scheduled maturities of our short-term investments and cash flows from operating activities, and we may not be able to obtain debt financing or credit facilities to fund any such capital investment or working capital requirements.\nOur ability to successfully obtain debt financing or credit facilities or raise equity capital in the future will depend in part upon prevailing capital market conditions, as well as conditions in our business and our operating results, and those factors may affect our efforts to obtain additional capital on terms that are satisfactory to us. If adequate capital is not available, or not available on beneficial terms, we may not be able to make future investments, take advantage of acquisitions or other investment opportunities, or respond to competitive challenges. This could limit our ability to bid on new project opportunities, thereby limiting our potential growth and profitability.\nWe may not be able to obtain debt financing, credit facilities or surety bonds if and when needed on favorable terms, if at all.\nThere are a number of potential negative consequences for the energy sector that may result if oil and gas prices remain volatile (which has been exacerbated by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and the U.S. and other countries actions in response) or decline or if oil and gas companies continue to de-prioritize investments in exploration, development and production, including the continued or worsening of outflow of credit and capital from the energy sector and/or energy focused companies and further efforts by lenders to reduce their exposure to the energy sector, including the imposition of increased lending standards for the energy sector, higher borrowing costs and collateral requirements, or a refusal to extend new credit or amend existing credit facilities in the energy sector. These potential negative consequences may be exacerbated by the pressure exerted on financial institutions by regulatory agencies to respond quickly and decisively to credit risk that develops in distressed industries. All these factors may complicate our ability to achieve a favorable outcome in obtaining debt financing or credit facilities.\nIn order to secure debt financing or credit facilities with borrowing capacity, if available, we may be required to provide significant collateral, pay high interest rates and otherwise agree to restrictive terms. Collateral requirements and higher borrowing costs may limit our long- and short-term financial flexibility, and any failure to secure debt financing or credit facilities on terms that are acceptable to us could jeopardize our ability to fund, among other things, capital expenditures and general working capital needs or meet our other financial commitments. In addition, in the second quarter 2021, we entered into a multiple indebtedness mortgage (\u201cMortgage Agreement\u201d) and a restrictive covenant arrangement (\u201cRestrictive Covenant Agreement\u201d) with one of our Sureties to secure our obligations and liabilities under our general indemnity agreement with such Surety associated with its outstanding surety bond obligations for our MPSV projects and two forty-vehicle ferry projects. We could be required to provide additional collateral to the Surety in support of these performance bonds or other performance bonds issued by the Surety or other Sureties.\nOur LC Facility currently provides for letters of credit, which are subject to cash securitization. We provide our customers letters of credit under our LC Facility and surety bonds from financial institutions to secure advance payments or guarantee performance under our contracts, or in lieu of retention being withheld on our contracts. With respect to a letter of credit under our LC Facility, any advance in the event of non-performance under a contract would become a direct obligation and reduction in our cash. With respect to a surety bond, any advance payment in the event of non-performance is subject to indemnification of the Surety by us, which may require us to use our cash, cash equivalents or short-term investments. When a contract is complete, the contingent obligation terminates, and letters of credit or surety bonds are returned. It has been increasingly difficult to obtain letters of credit and bonding capacity and identify potential financing sources, due to, among other things, losses from our operations in recent years, including charges on projects within our Shipyard Division and discontinued operations. We can provide no assurances that necessary letters of credit or bonding capacity will be available to support future project requirements. See Note 7 and \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d in Item 7 for further discussion of our LC Facility, surety bonds and Mortgage Agreement and Restrictive Covenant Agreement, and Note 10 for further discussion of our MPSV dispute.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations.\nOur ability to fund operations depends on our ability to generate future cash flows from operations. This, to a large extent, is subject to conditions in the oil and gas industry, including commodity prices, demand for our services and the prices we are able to charge for our services, general economic and financial conditions, competition in the markets in which we operate, the impact of legislative and regulatory actions on how we conduct our business and other factors, all of which are beyond our control. During 2021 and 2020, we experienced negative cash flows from operations, and this trend could continue if conditions in our industry continue or worsen or if we were to experience losses on our projects. See \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d in Item 7 for further discussion of our business outlook.\nIn addition, on April 17, 2020, we entered into an unsecured loan in the aggregate amount of $10.0 million (\u201cPPP Loan\u201d) with Whitney Bank pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d). Following the Small Business Administration\u2019s (\u201cSBA\u201d) approval of our application requesting forgiveness for a portion of the PPP Loan, we repaid Whitney Bank the remaining balance of the PPP Loan, together with accrued interest. However, because the amount borrowed exceeded $2.0 million, we are required by the SBA to retain all records relating to the PPP Loan for six years from the date the loan was forgiven and permit authorized representatives of the SBA to access such records upon request. While we believe we are a qualifying business and have met the eligibility requirements for the PPP Loan, and believe we have used the loan proceeds only for expenses which may be paid using proceeds from the PPP Loan, we can provide no assurances that any potential SBA review or audit will verify the amount forgiven, in whole or in part, and we could be required to repay all or part of the forgiven amount. See Note 7 and \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d in Item 7 for further discussion of the PPP Loan.\nWorkforce Risks\nIf we continue to have insufficient utilization levels for our facilities or personnel, our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nIn recent years we have experienced an under-utilization of our facilities and personnel and have not fully recovered our fixed overhead costs, due in part to the high fixed costs of our operations and the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and volatile oil and gas prices. This has resulted in losses from our operations. If current or future facility and personnel capacity fails to match current or future customer demands for our services, our facilities would continue to be under-utilized, which could result in less profitable operations or ongoing losses from our operations.\nOur employees and subcontractors work on projects that are inherently dangerous. If we fail to maintain safe work sites, we can be exposed to significant financial losses and reputational harm.\nWe work on projects with large, mechanized equipment, moving vehicles, and dangerous processes, which can place our employees and subcontractors in challenging environments. We maintain a safety assurance program designed to ensure the safety of our employees and subcontractors and to ensure that we remain in compliance with all applicable federal and state mandated safety regulations. If our safety assurance program fails, our employees, subcontractors and others may become injured, disabled or lose their lives, and our projects may be delayed, causing exposure to litigation or investigations by regulators.\nUnsafe conditions at project work sites also have the potential to increase employee turnover, increase project costs and increase our operating costs. In addition, our customers often require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid contracts. Our failure to maintain adequate safety standards could result in lost project awards and customers or preclude us from tendering future bids.\nThese risks may be greater should we acquire companies that have poor safety performance, requiring corrective actions during the integration process. Further, while the acquired DSS Business has a good safety record, we are in the process of integrating our safety policies and procedures, which may not be successful and could result in material unanticipated challenges, expenses or liabilities. This may result in liabilities before such corrective actions are implemented.\nWe may be unable to employ a sufficient number of skilled personnel to execute our projects.\nOur operations require personnel with specialized skills and experience. In recent years we have reduced our skilled workforce attributable to our fabrication activities in response to decreases in the utilization of our facilities. Our productivity and profitability are significantly dependent upon our ability to attract and retain skilled construction supervision and craft labor, primarily welders, pipe fitters and equipment operators. Reductions in our labor force may make it more difficult to increase our labor force to desirable levels during periods of expanding customer demand and increases in our backlog.\nIn periods of increased demand for construction and services labor, the supply of skilled labor becomes increasingly limited resulting in higher costs of labor, including increases in wage rates and the costs of recruiting or training to attract and retain qualified personnel. Further, during times of higher demand for our services, if skilled labor become scarce, it could also increase our use of contract labor, which may have a higher cost and lower levels of productivity.\nIf we are unable to hire and retain necessary skilled labor, including the employees of the DSS Business, we may be unable to secure new project awards and expand our operations. Further, any shortage of skilled labor or ongoing challenges hiring and retaining skilled labor could negatively affect the quality, safety, timeliness and profitability of our projects.\nWorkplace vaccination or weekly testing requirements could impact our workforce, increase our costs and have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nCertain customers have issued vaccine requirements with respect to our employees who provide on-site services at customer facilities. Vaccination requirements for our workforce could materially affect our operations, as substantially all of our employees reside in Louisiana and Texas where the vaccination rates are relatively low. Implementation of any such requirements may result in attrition of our employees, and difficulty retaining and attracting employees, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Any vaccination requirements may also put us at a competitive disadvantage if our competitors are better able to comply with such requirements. A failure to comply with these requirements or to ensure compliance by our subcontractors could damage our reputation and may cause our customers to cancel contracts with us or to not award future business to us.\nOur success is dependent on key personnel.\nOur success is dependent upon the abilities of our executives, management, and other key employees who have significant experience within our industry. Our success also depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly-skilled personnel in various areas, including construction supervision, project management, procurement, project controls and finance. The loss of one or more key personnel or our inability to attract, retain and motivate necessary personnel could impact our operations. In addition, we may not be able to retain key employees assumed in an acquisition, including the DSS Acquisition, which may impact our ability to successfully integrate or operate the business acquired.\nWe depend on third parties to provide services to perform our contractual obligations and supply raw materials.\nWe rely on third parties to provide raw materials and major components, and depend upon subcontractors for a variety of reasons, including: (i) to perform work we would otherwise perform with our employees but are unable to do so as a result of scheduling demands; (ii) to supervise and/or perform certain aspects of a contract more efficiently considering the conditions of the contract; and (iii) to perform certain services that we are unable to do or which we believe can be performed at a lower cost by subcontractors.\nFailure of suppliers and subcontractors, on which we rely, to deliver materials and provide services, or perform under their contracts on a timely basis, or at all, due to their own financial or operational difficulties or inability to fulfill their contractual obligations due to the reduced availability of their workforce, has had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our operations. For example, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the anticipated impact of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 on our suppliers and subcontractors has resulted in, and may continue to result in, scheduling delays and higher costs, including as a result of inflation, for subcontracted services and materials. Further, certain deliverables from third-party engineering firms supporting our projects have been delayed. The inability of our suppliers or subcontractors to perform could result in the need to transition to alternative suppliers or subcontractors, which could result in significant incremental costs and delay, or the need for us to provide other supplemental means to support our existing suppliers and subcontractors. Disruptions and performance problems caused by our suppliers and subcontractors, or a misalignment between our contractual obligations to our customers and our agreements with our subcontractors and suppliers, could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers.\nWe may be protected from increases in material costs through cost escalation provisions in some of our contracts. However, the difference between our actual material costs and these escalation provisions may expose us to cost uncertainty. In addition, we may experience significant delays in deliveries of key raw materials, which may occur as a result of availability or price, including higher costs due to inflation.\nStrategic Risks\nOur efforts to strategically reposition the Company to diversify our service offerings and customer base may not result in increased shareholder value.\nOur operations have historically been focused on fabrication and services for the offshore oil and gas industry. We have diversified our business through the pursuit of onshore fabrication opportunities and sustainable energy and other projects that are not related to our traditional offshore oil and gas markets. In the fourth quarter 2021, we expanded our offshore services offerings and further diversified our offshore customer base through the DSS Acquisition. Entry into, or further development of, new lines of business may expose us to risks that are different from those we have experienced historically. We may not be able to effectively manage these additional risks or implement successful business strategies. Additionally, our competitors in these expanded lines of business may possess greater operational knowledge, resources and experience than we do. These diversification initiatives may not increase shareholder value and could result in a reduction in shareholder value depending upon our required capital investment and success.\nThe financial benefits we expect to receive as a result of the Shipyard Transaction may not be realized.\nWe plan to continue to use the net cash proceeds realized from the Shipyard Transaction to fund net working capital liabilities associated with the Retained Shipyard Contracts and other Shipyard Division liabilities and to support the wind down of the Shipyard Division operations, which is anticipated to occur by the third quarter 2022. We may from time to time going forward continue to find our liquidity position to be challenging, and our use of the proceeds from the Shipyard Transaction may not improve our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows or enhance the trading value of our common stock. In addition, we expect to receive the remaining $0.9 million of the Transaction Price in 2022 upon Bollinger\u2019s collection of certain customer payments associated with the Divested Shipyard Contracts. In the event Bollinger fails to achieve certain contractual milestones and collect such amounts from the customer or Bollinger makes any indemnification or other claims arising out of the Shipyard Transaction that are not resolved in our favor, we may not realize the full economic value we expect to derive from the Shipyard Transaction. In addition, the sale of our Shipyard Division assets and a majority of our long-term construction contracts results in a less diversified business portfolio, and we will have a greater dependency on the performance of our remaining operations for our financial results.\nIn connection with the Shipyard Transaction, we also entered into a transition services agreement with Bollinger, pursuant to which each party will provide certain transition services to the other party. In the course of performing our obligations under the transition services agreement, we have agreed to make available to Bollinger certain operational assets and support at a contracted price, including assets, facilities, equipment and the time and attention of our management, which may interfere with the efficient performance of our responsibilities with respect to our remaining operations.\nFurther, we must successfully complete the Active Retained Shipyard Contracts and we can provide no assurances that the execution of such projects will not be impacted by the Shipyard Transaction or that we will be able complete such projects within our forecast cost estimates.\nAll of the above factors associated with the Shipyard Transaction, among others, may negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be unable to successfully integrate the DSS Business and realize the anticipated benefits of the DSS Acquisition.\nThe integration of the DSS Business will require significant management attention and resources. Potential difficulties we may encounter in the integration process include the following:\n\u2022\nthe failure to retain the skilled employees of the DSS Business;\n\u2022\nthe loss of our customers or those of the DSS Business following the DSS Acquisition;\n\u2022\nthe complexities of integrating companies with different standards, controls, processes and procedures and operating structures;\n\u2022\npotential unknown liabilities and unforeseen additional expenses associated with the DSS Acquisition; and\n\u2022\nperformance of our business and the DSS Business being negatively impacted by the diversion of management\u2019s attention of both our business and the DSS Business caused by the integration.\nFor these reasons, it is possible that the integration process could result in the distraction of management, the disruption of our ongoing business or inconsistencies in our services, standards, controls, processes and procedures, any of which could adversely affect our ability to execute our projects, or maintain relationships with customers, subcontractors, suppliers and employees. Further, the DSS Acquisition involved the acquisition of real property, which may subject us to future environmental or other liabilities not discovered in our due diligence process. Any of the aforementioned factors could prevent us from realizing the anticipated benefits of the DSS Acquisition on our expected timeline or at all, or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results.\nOur strategy to monetize under-utilized assets, including the sale of assets held for sale, and rationalize under-utilized facilities to improve our facility utilization, could result in future losses or impairments and may not produce our desired results.\nWe are taking actions to monetize under-utilized assets, and during 2021 and 2020, sold certain assets held for sale for net proceeds of $4.4 million and $1.7 million, respectively. At December 31, 2021, our remaining assets held for sale totaled $1.8 million. Further, our ongoing evaluation of under-utilized assets could result in the identification of additional assets for sale. In the past, we have recorded impairments associated with our assets held for sale. We can provide no assurances that we will successfully sell our assets held for sale, that we will be able to do so in accordance with our expected timeline or that we will recover the carrying value of the assets, which could result in additional impairments or losses. Additionally, any decisions made regarding our deployment or use of any sales proceeds we receive involves risks and uncertainties. As a result, our decisions with respect to such proceeds may not lead to increased long-term shareholder value. See Note 5 for further discussion of our assets held for sale.\nWe are also taking actions to relocate assets, consolidate operations and rationalize under-utilized facilities to improve our facility and personnel utilization. Such actions may include the closure or consolidation of one or more of our facilities and the termination of facility employees. During 2020, we closed our Jennings Facility and Lake Charles Facility, and during 2021, we sold our Shipyard Facility in connection with the Shipyard Transaction and consolidated certain operations within our F&S Facility. In connection therewith, during 2021 and 2020, we recorded impairments of certain assets and recorded losses on the sale of certain assets. A facility closure or consolidation could result in future impairments of facility assets and other restructuring or exits costs, including retention, severance or other costs associated with terminated personnel. Further, we can provide no assurances that any facility closure or consolidation will result in an improvement in our overall utilization or that the costs of doing so will not exceed the benefits expected to be gained from the closure or consolidation of a facility. See Note 3 for further discussion of the Shipyard Transaction and our closure of the Jennings Facility and Lake Charles Facility.\nLegal, Regulatory and Environmental Risks\nAny changes in U.S. trade policies and retaliatory responses from other countries may significantly increase the costs or limit supplies of materials and products used in our fabrication projects.\nIn the recent past, the federal government imposed new or increased tariffs or duties on an array of imported materials and products used in connection with our fabrication business, including steel, which raised our costs for these items (or products made with them), and threatened to impose further tariffs, duties and/or trade restrictions on imports. Foreign governments, including China and Canada, and trading blocs, such as the European Union, responded by imposing or increasing tariffs, duties and/or trade restrictions on U.S. goods. Recently, in response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the U.S. and other countries imposed sanctions and/or other restrictive actions against Russia. These developments have caused global economic disruptions, including increases in energy prices, and the ultimate impact on global economic conditions and on our business cannot yet be determined. Any trading conflicts and related escalating governmental actions that result in additional tariffs, duties and/or trade restrictions could increase our costs, cause disruptions or shortages in our supply chains and/or negatively impact the U.S., regional or local economies.\nWe are susceptible to adverse weather conditions in our market areas.\nOur operations may be subject to seasonal variations due to weather conditions and daylight hours, and to the extent climate change results in an increase in extreme adverse weather conditions, the likelihood of a negative impact on our operations may increase. Although we have large covered fabrication facilities, a significant amount of our construction activities continues to take place outdoors, and accordingly, the number of labor hours worked may decline during the winter months due to unfavorable weather conditions and a decrease in daylight hours. In addition, the seasonality of oil and gas industry activity in the GOM also affects our operations. Our offshore oil and gas customers often schedule the completion of their projects during the summer months in order to take advantage of more favorable weather during such months. Further, rainy weather, tropical storms, hurricanes and other storms prevalent in the GOM and along the Gulf Coast may also affect our operations. For example, in the third quarter 2021 and third quarter 2020, we experienced damage to our facilities in Houma, Louisiana and Lake Charles, Louisiana, respectively, due to Hurricane Ida and Laura, respectively, which both made landfall as high-end Category 4 hurricanes. The impact of severe weather conditions or natural disasters has included and may continue to include the disruption of our workforce; curtailment of services; weather-related damage to our facilities and equipment, including impacts from infrastructure challenges in the surrounding areas, resulting in suspension of operations; inability to deliver equipment, personnel and products to job sites in accordance with contract schedules; and loss of productivity. Our suppliers and subcontractors are also subject to severe weather and natural or environmental disasters that could affect their ability to deliver products or services or otherwise perform under their contracts. Furthermore, our customers\u2019 operations have been materially and adversely affected by severe weather and seasonal weather conditions, including Hurricane Ida, resulting in reduced demand for our services. See Note 2 and \u201cOverview\u201d in Item 7 for further discussion of the impacts of adverse weather conditions to our operations.\nThe nature of our industry subjects us to compliance with regulatory and environmental laws.\nOur operations and properties are subject to a wide variety of existing foreign, federal, state and local laws and other regulations, including those governing discharges into the air and water, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, the remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous substances and the health and safety of employees. In addition, we could be affected by future laws or regulations, including those imposed in response to concerns over climate change, other aspects of the environment, or natural resources. For example, because of concerns that carbon dioxide, methane and certain other greenhouse gases may produce climate changes that have significant impacts on public health and the environment, various governmental authorities have considered and are continuing to consider the adoption of regulatory strategies and controls designed to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases resulting from regulated activities, which if adopted in areas where we conduct business, could require us or our customers to incur additional compliance costs, may result in delays in the pursuit of regulated activities, prevent customers\u2019 projects from going forward and could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that some of our customers produce, thereby potentially limiting demand for our services.\nCompliance with many of these laws is becoming increasingly complex, stringent and expensive. These laws may impose \u201cstrict liability\u201d for damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety, rendering a party liable for the environmental damage without regard to its negligence or fault. Certain environmental laws provide for strict, joint and several liability for remediation of spills and other releases of hazardous substances, as well as damage to natural resources. In addition, we could be subject to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as a result of alleged exposure to hazardous substances. Such laws and regulations may also expose us to liability for the conduct of others or conditions caused by others, or acts for which we were in compliance with applicable laws at the time such acts were performed. We believe that our present operations materially comply with applicable federal and state pollution control and environmental protection laws and regulations. To date, compliance with such laws has not resulted in a material adverse effect on our operations. However, such environmental laws are changed frequently. Sanctions for noncompliance may include revocation of permits, corrective action orders, administrative or civil penalties and criminal prosecution. It is also possible that the current administration and Congress will impose additional environmental regulations or laws that will restrict federal oil and gas leasing, permitting or drilling practices on public lands and waters, which could result in more stringent or costly restrictions, delays or cancellations to our operations. For example, in the fourth quarter 2021, the current administration proposed reforms to the country\u2019s oil and gas leasing program, which would raise costs for energy companies to drill on public lands and waters, and President Biden previously issued orders temporarily suspending leasing or permitting of oil and gas activities on federal lands and waters. The current administration has also proposed a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing on federal lands and waters. Although such actions have not resulted in permanent restrictions, we are currently unable to predict whether these and other environmental regulations will have a material adverse effect on our future operations and financial results. See \u201cGovernment and Environmental Regulation\u201d in Item 1 for further discussion.\nThe demand for our services is also affected by changing taxes, price controls and other laws and regulations related to the oil and gas, chemicals, commodities and alternative energy industries. We may not be able to pass any potential increases in taxes on to our customers.\nOffshore construction and drilling in certain areas is opposed by many environmental groups and, in certain areas, has been restricted. To the extent laws are enacted or other governmental actions are taken that prohibit or restrict offshore construction and drilling or impose environmental protection requirements that result in increased costs to the oil and gas industry in general and the offshore construction industry, our business and prospects could be adversely affected. We cannot determine to what extent future operations and results of operations may be affected by new legislation, new regulations or changes in existing regulations.\nActions of activist shareholders could create uncertainty about our future strategic direction, be costly and divert the attention of our management and board. In addition, some institutional investors may be discouraged from investing in the industries that we service.\nIn recent years, activist shareholders have placed increasing pressure on publicly-traded companies to effect changes to corporate governance practices, executive compensation practices or social and environmental practices or to undertake certain corporate actions or reorganizations. There can be no assurances that additional activist shareholders will not publicly advocate for us to make further corporate governance changes or engage in certain corporate actions. Responding to challenges from activist shareholders, such as proxy contests, media campaigns or other public or private means, could be costly and time consuming and could have an adverse effect on our reputation and divert the attention and resources of management and our board, which could have an adverse effect on our business and operational results. Additionally, shareholder activism could create uncertainty about our leadership or our future strategic direction, resulting in loss of future business opportunities, which could adversely affect our business, future operations, profitability and our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. As of December 31, 2021, based on our review of public filings with the SEC, we believe over half of our stock is held by a combination of institutional investors, pooled investment funds, and certain other investors with a history of shareholder activism. One such investor has a Schedule 13D on file with the SEC that reserves that investor\u2019s rights to pursue corporate governance changes, board structure changes, changes to capitalization, potential business combinations or dispositions involving the Company or certain of our businesses, or suggestions for improving the Company\u2019s financial and/or operational performance.\nIn addition to risks associated with activist shareholders, some institutional investors are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) factors when allocating their capital. These investors may be seeking enhanced ESG disclosures and actions or may implement policies that discourage investment in certain of the industries, including the oil and gas industry, that we service. To the extent that certain institutional investors implement policies that discourage investments in industries that we service, it could have an adverse effect on our financing costs and access to sources of capital. Further, we may not succeed in implementing or communicating an ESG message that is well understood or received. As a result, we may experience diminished reputation or sentiment, reduced access to sources of capital, an inability to attract and retain qualified personnel and loss of customers, suppliers or subcontractors.\nOur business is highly dependent on our ability to utilize the navigation canals adjacent to our facilities.\nOur facilities in Houma, Louisiana are located on the Houma Navigation Canal approximately 30 miles from the GOM and on a slip adjacent to the Houma Navigation Canal. The Houma Navigation Canal provides the shortest and least restrictive means of access from our facilities to open waters. These waterways are navigable waterways of the U.S. and, as such, are protected by federal law from unauthorized obstructions that would hinder water-borne traffic. Federal law also authorizes maintenance of these waterways by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. These waterways are dredged from time to time to maintain water depth and, while federal funding for dredging has historically been provided, there is no assurance that Congressional appropriations sufficient for adequate dredging and other maintenance of these waterways will be continued. If funding were not appropriated for that purpose, some or all of these waterways could become impassable by barges or other vessels required to transport many of our products.", "PERMNO": 84737, "SIC": 3730, "TIC": "GIFI"}
