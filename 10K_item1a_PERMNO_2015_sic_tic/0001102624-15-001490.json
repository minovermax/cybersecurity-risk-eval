{"cik": "1140310", "company": "EnSync, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-09-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks, some of which are beyond our control. This discussion highlights some of the risks which may affect future operating results. These are the risks and uncertainties we believe are most important for you to consider. We cannot be certain that we will successfully address these risks. If we are unable to address these risks, our business may not grow, our stock price may suffer and we may be unable to stay in business. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, which we currently deem immaterial or which are similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or business in general, may also impair our business operations.\nWe have incurred losses since our inception in 1998 and anticipate incurring continuing losses.\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, we had revenues of $1,763,510. During this period, we had a net loss of $12,885,807 after deducting the net loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest. There can be no assurance that we will have income from operations or net income in the future. As of June 30, 2015 we had an accumulated deficit of $102,674,048. As discussed in our financial statements our significant operating losses and operating cash flow deficits raise doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We anticipate that we will continue to incur losses and operating cash flow deficits until we can produce and sell, if ever, a sufficient number of our systems to be profitable. However, we cannot predict when we will operate profitably, if ever. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may be unable to sustain or increase our profitability in the future.\nWe may require a substantial amount of additional funds to finance our capital requirements and the growth of our business, and we may not be able to raise a sufficient amount of funds, or be able to do so on terms favorable to us and our stockholders, or at all.\nWe have incurred losses since our inception in 1998 and expect to continue to incur losses until we are able to significantly grow our revenues. Accordingly we may need additional financing to remain in operation and to maintain and expand our business, and such financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. In the event that we issue any additional equity securities, investors\u2019 interests in the Company will be diluted and investors may suffer dilution in their net book value per share depending on the price at which such securities are sold. Further, any such issuance may result in a change in control.\nIf we are unable to obtain the necessary funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to:\n\u00b7\nexecute our growth plan;\n\u00b7\ntake advantage of future opportunities;\n\u00b7\nrespond to customers and competition; or\n\u00b7\nremain in operation.\nWe may issue debt and/or senior equity securities in the future which would be senior to our common stock upon liquidation. Upon liquidation, holders of our debt securities, senior equity securities and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive distributions of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock. As a result of the significant number of convertible preferred shares outstanding, our common stockholders may receive nothing in the case of a liquidation event.\nOur stock price could be volatile and our trading volume may fluctuate substantially.\nThe price of our common stock has been and may in the future continue to be extremely volatile, with the sale price fluctuating from a low of $0.40 to a high of $30.00 since June 18, 2007, the first day our stock was traded on the NYSE MKT. Many factors could have a significant impact on the future price of our common stock, including:\n\u00b7\nthe various risks and uncertainties discussed herein;\n\u00b7\ngeneral domestic and international economic conditions and other external factors;\n\u00b7\ngeneral market conditions; and\n\u00b7\nthe degree of trading liquidity in our common stock.\nIn addition, the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market price of securities issued by many companies which may be unrelated to the operating performance of those particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect our share price, notwithstanding our operating results.\nFor the three-month period ended June 30, 2015, the daily trading volume for shares of our common stock ranged from 59,000 to 4,224,300 shares traded per day, and the average daily trading volume during such three-month period was 446,018 shares traded per day. Accordingly, our investors who wish to dispose of their shares of common stock on any given trading day may not be able to do so or may be able to dispose of only a portion of their shares of common stock.\nSPI could sell or transfer a substantial number of shares of our common stock, which could depress the price of our securities or result in a change in control of the Company.\nSPI currently holds 8,000,000 shares of our common stock and convertible preferred stock and a warrant that, assuming full conversion and exercise, would result in the ownership by SPI of an additional 92,000,600 shares of our common stock. SPI has no contractual restrictions on its ability to sell or transfer our common stock on the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, and these sales or transfers could create substantial declines in the price of our securities or, if these sales or transfers were made to a single buyer or group of buyers, could contribute to a transfer of control of the Company to a third party. Sales by SPI of a substantial number of shares, or the expectation of such sales, could cause a significant reduction in the market price of our common stock.\nOur industry is highly competitive and we may be unable to successfully compete.\nWe compete in the market for renewable energy products and services which is intensely competitive. Evolving industry standards, rapid price changes and product obsolescence also impact the market. Our competitors include many domestic and foreign companies, most of which have substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we do. Our current competitors or new market entrants could introduce new or enhanced technologies, products or services with features that render our technologies, products or services obsolete or less marketable. Our success will be dependent upon our ability to develop products that are superior to existing products and products introduced in the future, and which are cost effective. In addition, we may be required to continually enhance any products that are developed as well as introduce new products that keep pace with technological change and address the increasingly sophisticated needs of the marketplace. Even if our current technologies prove to be commercially feasible, there is extensive research and development being conducted on alternative energy sources that may render our technologies and protocols obsolete or otherwise non-competitive.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to keep pace with the technological demands of the marketplace or successfully develop products that will succeed in the marketplace. As a small company, we will be at a competitive disadvantage to most of our competitors, which include larger, established companies that have substantially greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, distribution and other resources than us. There can be no assurance that we will have the capital resources available to undertake the research which may be necessary to upgrade our equipment or develop new devices to meet the efficiencies of changing technologies. Our inability to adapt to technological change could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur ability to achieve significant revenue growth will be dependent on the successful commercialization of our new products, including our Agile Hybrid Storage System and Matrix Energy Management System.\nWe anticipate that a substantial majority of our revenue in fiscal year 2016 will come from new products, including our Agile Hybrid Storage System and Matrix Energy Management System. If these new products do not meet with market acceptance, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected. A number of factors may affect the market acceptance of our new products, including, among others:\n\u00b7\nthe price of our products relative to other products either currently available or subsequently introduced;\n\u00b7\nthe perception by potential customers and strategic partners of the effectiveness of our products for their intended purposes;\n\u00b7\nour ability to fund our manufacturing, sales and marketing efforts; and\n\u00b7\nthe effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts.\nOur products are and will be sold in new and rapidly evolving markets. As such, we cannot accurately predict the extent to which demand for these products will increase, if at all. We do not know whether our targeted customers will accept our technology or will purchase our products in sufficient quantities to allow our business to grow. To succeed, demand for our products must increase significantly in existing markets, and there must be strong demand for products that we introduce in the future. The commercial success of our new products is also dependent on the design and development of an efficient and cost effective means to integrate such products into existing electrical systems.\nTo achieve profitability, we will need to lower our costs and increase our margins, which we may not be able to do.\nTo achieve profitability we will need to lower our costs and increase our margins. These efforts may fail due to unforeseen factors. Our failure to lower our costs could make our products less competitive and harm our ability to grow our revenues. Our inability to lower our costs and increase our margins could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIf our products do not perform as planned, we could experience increased costs, lower margins and harm to our reputation.\nWe have developed a portfolio of new products. The failure of our products to perform as planned could result in increased costs, lower margins and harm to our reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. For example a substantial majority of our revenue in recent periods came from our third generation ZBB EnerStore zinc bromide flow battery and ZBB EnerSection power and energy control center; as we initially reported in August, 2014, subsequent to commercialization, installation and commissioning of units in the field we garnered meaningful insights that resulted in system design modifications and other general upgrades that improved performance, efficiency, and reliability. In the interest of enhancing customer satisfaction and market reputation, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 we launched an initiative to implement these improvements at certain locations of our installed base over fiscal 2015. As a result of this initiative, results of operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2014 included a charge of $1.8 million.\nWe need to continue to improve the performance of our products to meet future requirements and competitive pressures.\nWe need to continue to improve various aspects of our technology as we move forward with larger scale production and new applications of our products. For example, through our collaboration with Lotte Chemical Corporation we are currently working to develop a 500kWh version of our zinc bromide battery. Our products are complex and there can be no assurance our development efforts will be successful. Future developments and competition may reveal additional technical issues that are not currently recognized as obstacles. If we cannot continue to improve the performance of our products in a timely manner, we may be forced to redesign or delay large scale production or possibly abandon our product development efforts altogether.\nWe must build quality products to ensure acceptance of our products.\nThe market perception of our products and related acceptance of such products is highly dependent upon the quality and reliability of the products we build. Any quality problems attributable to our product lines may substantially impair our revenue and operating results. Moreover, quality problems for our product lines could cause us to delay or cease shipments of products or have to recall or field upgrade products, thus adversely affecting our ability to meet revenue or cost targets. In addition, while we seek to limit our liability as a result of product failure or defects through warranty and other limitations, if one of our products fails, a customer could suffer a significant loss and seek to hold us responsible for that loss and our reputation with other current or potential customers would likely suffer.\nTo succeed, we will need to rapidly grow and we may not be successful in managing this rapid growth.\nIn order to successfully grow our revenues and become profitable as well as meet the target set forth in our Supply Agreement with SPI, we will need to grow rapidly. If we fail to effectively manage this growth, our business could be adversely affected. Rapid growth will place significant demands on our management, operational and financial infrastructure. If we do not effectively manage our growth, we may fail to timely deliver products to our customers in sufficient volume or the quality of our products could suffer, which could negatively affect our operating results. To effectively manage this growth, we will need to hire additional personnel, and we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. As we move forward in commercializing our new products, we will also need to effectively manage our manufacturing and marketing needs, which represent new areas of oversight for us. These additional employees, systems enhancements and improvements will require significant capital expenditures and management resources. Failure to successfully implement these improvements could hurt our ability to manage our growth and our financial position.\nOur relationships with our strategic partners may not be successful, and we may not be successful in establishing additional partnerships, which could adversely affect our ability to commercialize our products and services.\nAn important element of our business strategy is to enter into strategic partnerships with partners who can assist us in achieving our business goals. We are currently a party to several strategic partnership arrangements and any disruption in these collaborations could be detrimental to our business. The most significant of these strategic partnerships is our partnership with SPI. We expect to seek additional collaborators or strategic partners due to the expense, effort and expertise required to develop market and commercialize our products and our limited resources, but we may not be successful in our efforts to establish additional strategic partnerships and arrangements. If our strategic partners do not satisfy their obligations to us, we are unable to meet our strategic partners\u2019 expectations and demands or we are unable to reach agreements with additional suitable strategic partners, we may fail to meet our business objectives for the commercialization of our products. The terms of any additional strategic partnerships or other arrangements that we establish may not be favorable to us. Our inability to successfully implement strategic partnerships and arrangements could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe expect that a significant portion of our sales will be to a single customer.\nOn July 13, 2015, in connection with the closing of the transaction between the Company and SPI, we entered into a Supply Agreement with SPI pursuant to which we agreed to provide SPI with Products and related Services (each as defined in the Supply Agreement) that have an aggregated total of at least 40 megawatt of energy storage rated power output prior to the 48-month anniversary of the date of the Supply Agreement with certain lower megawatt thresholds being required to be met at the 12-month, 24-month and 36-month anniversaries of the Supply Agreement. While we are continually seeking to expand our customer base, we anticipate that orders under the Supply Agreement will comprise a very significant portion of our sales through at least fiscal 2019. This arrangement makes us significantly dependent on SPI. Any decline in the anticipated orders from SPI or the failure of SPI to satisfy its obligations under the Supply Agreement could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our future success is dependent upon the anticipated purchases by SPI. In addition, our dependence on our strategic partnership with SPI exposes us to numerous other risks, including: (i) a slowdown or delay in SPI\u2019s deployment of our products could significantly reduce demand for our products; (ii) current or future economic conditions could negatively affect SPI and cause them to significantly reduce operations, or file for bankruptcy; and (iii) concentration of accounts receivable credit risk, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition if SPI declared bankruptcy or delayed payments due under the Supply Agreement. Finally, if we are unable to meet our obligations to SPI under the Supply Agreement, SPI may terminate the agreement which would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on sole and limited source suppliers and outsource selected component manufacturing, and shortages or delay of supplies of component parts may adversely affect our operating results until alternate sources can be developed.\nOur operations are dependent on the ability of suppliers to deliver quality components, devices and subassemblies in time to meet critical manufacturing and distribution schedules. If we experience any constrained supply of any such component parts, such constraints, if persistent, may adversely affect operating results until alternate sourcing can be developed. There may be an increased risk of supplier constraints in periods where we are increasing production volume to meet customer demands. Volatility in the prices of component parts, an inability to secure enough components at reasonable prices to build new products in a timely manner in the quantities and configurations demanded or, conversely, a temporary oversupply of these parts, could adversely affect our future operating results.\nWe purchase several component parts from sole source and limited source suppliers. As a result of our current production volumes, we lack significant leverage with these and other suppliers especially when compared to some of our larger competitors. If our suppliers receive excess demand for their products, we may receive a low priority for order fulfillment as large volume customers may receive priority that may result in delays in our acquiring components. If we are delayed in acquiring components for our products, the manufacture and shipment of our products could be delayed. Lead times for ordering materials and components vary significantly and depend on factors such as specific supplier requirements, contract terms, the extensive production time required and current market demand for such components. Some of these delays may be substantial. As a result, we sometimes purchase critical, long lead time or single sourced components in large quantities to help protect our ability to deliver finished products. If we overestimate our component requirements, we may have excess inventory, which will increase our costs. If we underestimate our component requirements, we will have inadequate inventory, which will delay our manufacturing and render us unable to deliver products to customers on scheduled delivery dates. Manufacturing delays could negatively impact our ability to sell our products and could damage our customer relationships.\nTo assure the availability of our products to our customers, we outsource the manufacturing of selected components prior to the receipt of purchase orders from customers. However, we do not recognize revenue for such products until we receive an order from a customer and the product is shipped. As demand for our products may not materialize, this product delivery method subjects us to increased risks of high inventory carrying costs, obsolescence and excess, and may increase our operating costs. In addition, we may from time to time make design changes to our products, which could lead to obsolescence of inventory.\nWe have no experience manufacturing our products on a large-scale basis and may be unable to do so at our manufacturing facilities.\nTo date, we have achieved only very limited production of our energy storage systems and have no experience manufacturing our products on a large-scale basis. In connection with our strategic partnership with SPI, we will have to increase our production of products significantly and rapidly. We believe our current facilities in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, are sufficient to allow us to significantly increase production of our products. However, there can be no assurance that our current facilities, even if operating at full capacity, will be adequate to enable us to produce the energy storage systems in sufficient quantities to meet potential future orders, including orders we anticipate receiving under the Supply Agreement with SPI. Our inability to manufacture a sufficient number of units on a timely basis would have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, strategic partner relationships, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, even if we are able to meet production requirements, we may not be able to achieve margins that enable us to become profitable.\nWe are subject to risks relating to product concentration and lack of revenue diversification.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenue from a limited number of products. These products are also an integral component of many of our other products. We expect these products to continue to account for a large percentage of our revenues in the near term. Continued market acceptance of these products is therefore critical to our future success. Our future success will also depend on our ability to reduce our dependence on these few products by developing and introducing new products and product or feature enhancements in a timely manner. Specifically, our ability to capture significant market share depends on our ability to develop and market extensions to our existing product lines at higher and lower power range offerings and as containerized solutions. We are currently investing significant amounts in our products to broaden our product portfolio. Even if we are able to develop and commercially introduce new products and enhancements, they may not achieve market acceptance and the revenue generated from these new products and enhancements may not offset the costs, which would substantially impair our revenue, profitability and overall financial prospects. Successful product development and market acceptance of our existing and future products depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nchanging requirements of customers;\n\u00b7\naccurate prediction of market and technical requirements;\n\u00b7\ntimely completion and introduction of new designs;\n\u00b7\nquality, price and performance of our products;\n\u00b7\navailability, quality, price and performance of competing products and technologies;\n\u00b7\nour customer service and support capabilities and responsiveness;\n\u00b7\nsuccessful development of our relationships with existing and potential customers; and\n\u00b7\nchanges in technology, industry standards or end-user preferences.\nSPI has significant influence over key decision making and may ultimately acquire complete control of the Company.\nOn July 13, 2015, in connection with the closing of the transaction between the Company and SPI, we issued SPI 8,000,000 shares of our common stock and convertible preferred stock and a warrant that, assuming full conversion and exercise, would result in the ownership by SPI of an additional 92,000,600 shares of our common stock. SPI\u2019s 8,000,000 common shares represent approximately 17% of the outstanding common stock of the Company and, as a result, it may have the ability to exert influence over the outcome of matters submitted to our shareholders for approval. Additionally, the certificate designations, preferences, rights and limitations of SPI\u2019s convertible preferred stock allow it to vote on an as-converted basis on amendments to the Company\u2019s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws. Assuming the full conversion of SPI\u2019s convertible preferred stock (and that no other shares of common stock are issued pursuant to the exercise or conversion of outstanding derivative securities or otherwise), it would own greater than a majority of the outstanding common stock and would have the ability to exert complete control of the Company. As a shareholder, SPI is entitled to vote its shares in its own interest, which may not always be in the interests of our shareholders generally.\nAdditionally, the Company is party to a Governance Agreement with SPI (the \u201cGovernance Agreement\u201d). Under the Governance Agreement, SPI is entitled to nominate one director to our board of directors for so long as SPI holds at least 10,000 convertible preferred shares or 25 million shares of common stock or common stock equivalents (the \u201cRequisite Shares\u201d). Additionally, for so long as SPI holds the Requisite Shares (1) following the time at which the Series C-2 Preferred Stock shall have become convertible in full, SPI shall be entitled to nominate a total of two directors and (2) following the time at which the Series C-3 Preferred Stock shall have become convertible in full, SPI shall be entitled to nominate a total of three directors. The more representation that SPI gets on our board of directors, the more it will be able to influence the direction of the Company.\nThe Governance Agreement also provides that for so long as SPI holds the Requisite Shares, we will not take certain actions without the affirmative vote of SPI, including the following: (a) change the number or manner of appointment of the directors on the board; (b) other than in the ordinary course of conducting the Company\u2019s business, cause the incurrence, issuance, assumption, guarantee or refinancing of any debt if the aggregate amount of such debt and all other outstanding debt of the Company exceeds $10 million; (c) cause the acquisition of an interest in any entity or the acquisition of a substantial portion of the assets or business of any entity or any division or line of business thereof or any other acquisition of material assets, in any such case where the consideration paid exceeds $2 million, or cause the Company to engage in certain other Fundamental Transactions (as defined in the certificate of designation of preferences, rights and limitations of the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock); (d) cause the entering into by the Company of any agreement, arrangement or transaction with an affiliate that calls for aggregate payments (other than payment of salary, bonus or reimbursement of reasonable expenses) in excess of $120,000; (e) cause the commitment to capital expenditures in excess of $7 million during any fiscal year; (f) cause the selection or replacement of our auditors; (g) enter into of any partnership, consortium, joint venture or other similar enterprise involving the payment, contribution, or assignment by the Company or to the Company of money or assets greater than $5 million; (h) amend or otherwise change our Articles of Incorporation or by-laws or equivalent organizational documents of the Company or any subsidiary in any manner that materially and adversely affects any rights of SPI; or (i) grant, issue or sell any equity securities (with certain limited exceptions). These veto rights provide SPI with significant influence over the Company\u2019s operations and strategy. SPI may choose to exert its influence in a manner that is not in the best interests of our general shareholders.\nOur China joint venture could be adversely affected by the laws and regulations of the Chinese government, our lack of decision-making authority and disputes between us and the Joint Venture.\nThe China market has a large inherent need for advanced energy storage and power electronics and is likely to become the world\u2019s largest market for energy storage. To take advantage of this opportunity, in November 2011, we established a joint venture to develop, produce, sell, distribute and service advanced storage batteries and power electronics in China (the \u201cJoint Venture\u201d).\nHowever, achieving the anticipated benefits of the Joint Venture is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties.\nThe Joint Venture has (1) an exclusive royalty-free license to manufacture and distribute our third generation ZBB EnerStore zinc bromide flow battery and any other zinc bromide flow battery product developed internally by us based on the V3 EnerStore, ranging from 50kWh - 500kWh module design, and ZBB EnerSection power and energy control center (up to 250KW) (the \u201cProducts\u201d) in mainland China in the power supply management industry and (2) a non-exclusive royalty-free license to manufacture and distribute the Products in Hong Kong and Taiwan in the power supply management industry. Although the Joint Venture partners are contractually restricted from using our intellectual property outside of the Joint Venture, there is always a general risk associated with sharing intellectual property with third parties and the possibility that such information may be used and shared without our consent. Moreover, China laws that protect intellectual property rights are not as developed and favorable to the owner of such rights as are U.S. laws. If any of our intellectual property rights are used or shared without our approval in China, we may have difficulty in prosecuting our claim in an expeditious and effective manner. Difficulties or delays in enforcing our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nAs a general matter, there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of China laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the laws and regulations governing the anticipated business of the Joint Venture and the protection of intellectual property rights. These laws and regulations are sometimes vague and may be subject to future changes, and their official interpretation and enforcement may involve substantial uncertainty. The effectiveness of newly enacted laws, regulations or amendments may be delayed, resulting in detrimental reliance by foreign investors. New laws and regulations that affect existing and proposed future businesses may also be applied retroactively. The unpredictability of the interpretation and application of existing and new China laws and regulations will pose additional challenges for us as we seek to develop and grow the Joint Venture\u2019s business in China. Our failure to understand these laws or an unforeseen change in a law or the application thereof could have an adverse effect on the Joint Venture.\nThe success of the Joint Venture will depend in part on continued support of \u201cnew energy\u201d initiatives by the government of China that includes requirements for products like ours. Should the government change its policies in an unfavorable manner the anticipated demand for the Joint Venture\u2019s products in China may fail to materialize.\nThe Joint Venture may have economic, tax or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or goals, and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives. Disputes between us and the Joint Venture partners may result in litigation or arbitration that could be costly and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from focusing their time and effort on our day to day business. In addition, we may, in certain circumstances, be liable for the actions of the Joint Venture.\nThe Joint Venture is a new business in China. As with any new business, there will be many challenges facing the Joint Venture, including establishing successful manufacturing capabilities, developing a market for the Joint Venture\u2019s products, obtaining requisite governmental approvals and permits, implementation of an untested business plan, and securing adequate funding for working capital and growth. Failure to overcome any of these or any other challenges facing the Joint Venture could result in its failure.\nBusiness practices in Asia may entail greater risk and dependence upon the personal relationships of senior management than is common in North America, and therefore some of our agreements with other parties in China and South Korea could be difficult or impossible to enforce.\nWe are increasing our business activities in Asia. The business culture in parts of Asia is, in some respects, different from the business cultures in Western countries. Personal relationships among business principals of companies and business entities in Asia are very significant in their business cultures. In some cases, because so much reliance is based upon personal relationships, written contracts among businesses in Asia may be less detailed and specific than is commonly accepted for similar written agreements in Western countries. In some cases, material terms of an understanding are not contained in the written agreement but exist only as oral agreements. In other cases, the terms of transactions which may involve material amounts of money are not documented at all. In addition, in contrast to the Western business environment where a written agreement specifically defines the terms, rights and obligations of the parties in a legally-binding and enforceable manner, the parties to a written agreement in Asia may view that agreement more as a starting point for an ongoing business relationship which will evolve and undergo ongoing modification over time. As a result, any contractual arrangements we enter into with a counterparty in Asia may be more difficult to review, understand and/or enforce.\nOur success depends on our ability to retain our managerial personnel and to attract additional personnel.\nOur success depends largely on our ability to attract and retain managerial personnel. Competition for desirable personnel is intense, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain the necessary staff. The loss of members of managerial staff could have a material adverse effect on our future operations and on successful development of products for our target markets. The failure to maintain management and to attract additional key personnel could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe market and sell, and plan to market and sell, our products in numerous international markets. If we are unable to manage our international operations effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe market and sell, and plan to market and sell, our products in a number of foreign countries, including China, Australia, South Africa, Canada, European Union countries, the United Kingdom, Italy, Chile, Brazil, India, Mexico as well as Puerto Rico, various Caribbean island nations and various southeast Asia countries, and we are therefore subject to risks associated with having international operations. Risks inherent in international operations include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7\nchanges in general economic and political conditions in the countries in which we operate;\n\u00b7\nunexpected adverse changes in foreign laws or regulatory requirements, including those with respect to renewable energy, environmental protection, permitting, export duties and quotas;\n\u00b7\ntrade barriers such as export requirements, tariffs, taxes and other restrictions and expenses, which could increase the prices of our products and make us less competitive in some countries;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in exchange rates may affect demand for our products and may adversely affect our profitability;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty of, and costs relating to compliance with, the different commercial and legal requirements of the overseas markets in which we offer and sell our products;\n\u00b7\ninability to obtain, maintain or enforce intellectual property rights; and\n\u00b7\ndifficulty in enforcing agreements in foreign legal systems.\nOur business in foreign markets requires us to respond to rapid changes in market conditions in these countries. Our overall success as a global business depends, in part, on our ability to succeed in differing legal, regulatory, economic, social and political conditions. We may not be able to develop and implement policies and strategies that will be effective in each location where we do business, which in turn could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur sales cycle is lengthy and variable, which makes it difficult for us to forecast revenue and other operating results.\nThe sales cycle for our products is lengthy, which makes it difficult for us to accurately forecast revenue in a given period, and may cause revenue and operating results to vary significantly from period to period. Some potential customers for our products typically need to commit significant time and resources to evaluate the technology used in our products and their decision to purchase our products may be further limited by budgetary constraints and numerous layers of internal review and approval, which are beyond our control. We spend substantial time and effort assisting potential customers in evaluating our products, including providing demonstrations and validation. Even after initial approval by appropriate decision makers, the negotiation and documentation processes for the actual adoption of our products can be lengthy. As a result of these factors, based on our experience to date, our sales cycle, the time from initial contact with a prospective customer to routine commercial utilization of our products, has varied and can sometimes be several months or longer, which has made it difficult for us to accurately project revenues and other operating results. We expect that sales of power purchase agreements we enter into will also be uneven from quarter to quarter due to the need to group such agreements together for sale as well as other factors. As a result, our financial results may fluctuate on a quarterly basis which may adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nOur increased emphasis on larger and more complex system solutions and customer concentration may adversely affect our ability to accurately predict the timing of revenues and to meet short-term expectations of operating results.\nOur increased emphasis on larger and more complex system solutions has increased the effort and time required by us to complete sales to customers. Further, a larger portion of our quarterly revenue is derived from relatively few large transactions with relatively few customers. Any delay in completing these large sales transactions or any reduction in the number of customers or large transactions, may result in significant adverse fluctuations in our quarterly revenue. Further, we use anticipated revenues to establish our operating budgets and a large portion of our expenses, particularly rent and salaries are fixed in the short term. As a result, any shortfall or delay in revenue could result in increased losses and would likely cause our operating results to be below public expectations. The occurrence of any of these events would likely materially adversely affect our results of operations and likely cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nWe recently entered into our first power purchase agreement (\u201cPPA\u201d) which represents a new business for us. We have very limited experience in the PPA business, which is very complex, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop such business.\nWe recently entered into our first power purchase agreement (\u201cPPA\u201d) which represents a new business for us. We plan to continue to develop the PPA portion of our business and given our limited experience and the complex nature of this business we may encounter difficulties in doing so. When we enter into a PPA we agree to provide electricity to our customer at a fixed rate for a fixed period of time (typically 20 years). To satisfy our obligations under the PPA we need to develop a system that includes power generation capability (typically PV), and an energy management system and may also include energy storage. The development and construction of these systems can require long periods of time and substantial initial capital investments, and there are significant risks related to the development of such systems, including potential technical difficulties and regulatory difficulties, including obtaining necessary permits. There can be no assurance that we will be able to overcome these risks as we develop our PPA business. In light of the long-term nature of PPAs and the significant capital requirements associated with them, we plan to sell them to third parties rather than hold them for their full terms. The sale of PPAs is a complex endeavor that is impacted by a variety of factors including interest rates, the availability of tax and other incentives, the perceived reliability and bankability of the system and other market forces beyond our control. Even if we are able to sell our PPAs, we may retain significant exposure following the sale due to our keeping an ownership interest or because we warranty the related system or otherwise retain maintenance responsibility. Our inability to sell our PPAs on acceptable terms, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We have very limited experience in the PPA business, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop such business.\nWe expect to rely on third-party suppliers and contractors when developing and constructing systems for our PPA business.\nWe expect to source the components of systems deployed in our PPA business from a wide selection of third-party suppliers and engage third-party contractors for the construction of the systems. We expect to enter into contracts with our suppliers and contractors on a project-by-project basis rather than maintaining long-term contracts with our suppliers or contractors. Therefore, we expect to be exposed to price fluctuations with respect to the components sourced from our suppliers and the construction services procured from our contractors. Increases in the prices of system components, decreases in their availability, fluctuations in construction, labor and installation costs, or changes in the terms of our relationship with our suppliers and contractors may increase the cost of procuring equipment and engaging contractors and hence materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, the delivery of defective products or products or construction services by our suppliers or contractors which are otherwise not in compliance with contract specifications, or the late supply of products or construction services, may cause construction delays or solar power systems that fail to adhere to our quality and safety standards, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nBusinesses and consumers might not adopt alternative energy solutions as a means for obtaining their electricity and power needs, and therefore our revenues may not increase, and we may be unable to achieve and then sustain profitability.\nOn-site distributed power generation solutions, such as fuel cell, photovoltaic and wind turbine systems, which utilize our energy storage systems, provide an alternative means for obtaining electricity and are relatively new methods of obtaining electrical power that businesses may not adopt at levels sufficient to grow this part of our business. Traditional electricity distribution is based on the regulated industry model whereby businesses and consumers obtain their electricity from a government regulated utility. For alternative methods of distributed power to succeed, businesses and consumers must adopt new purchasing practices and must be willing to rely upon less traditional means of purchasing electricity. We cannot assure you that businesses and consumers will choose to utilize on-site distributed power at levels sufficient to sustain our business in this area. The development of a mass market for our products may be impacted by many factors which are out of our control, including:\n\u00b7\nmarket acceptance of fuel cell, photovoltaic and wind turbine systems that incorporate our products;\n\u00b7\nthe cost competitiveness of these systems;\n\u00b7\nregulatory requirements; and\n\u00b7\nthe emergence of newer, more competitive technologies and products.\nIf a mass market fails to develop or develops more slowly than we anticipate, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business depends in part on the regulatory treatment of third-party owned solar energy systems.\nRetail sales of electricity by non-utilities, such as us, face regulatory hurdles in some states and jurisdictions, including states and jurisdictions that we intend to enter where the laws and regulatory policies have not historically embraced competition to the service provided by the incumbent, vertically integrated electric utility. Some of the principal challenges pertain to whether non-customer owned systems qualify for the same levels of rebates or other non-tax incentives available for customer-owned solar energy systems, whether third-party owned systems are eligible at all for these incentives and whether third-party owned systems are eligible for net metering and the associated significant cost savings. Furthermore, in some states and utility territories third parties are limited in the way that they may deliver solar to their customers. In jurisdictions such as Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina and Utah and in Los Angeles, California, laws have been interpreted to prohibit the sale of electricity pursuant to our standard power purchase agreement, in some cases, leading residential solar energy system providers to use leases in lieu of power purchase agreements. Changes in law, reductions in, eliminations of or additional application requirements for, these benefits could reduce demand for our systems, adversely impact our access to capital and could cause us to increase the price we charge our customers for energy.\nThe success of our business depends on our ability to develop and protect our intellectual property rights, which could be expensive.\nOur ability to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technologies, systems designs and manufacturing processes. While we have attempted to safeguard and maintain our proprietary rights, there can be no assurance we have been or will be completely successful in doing so. We rely on patents, trademarks, and policies and procedures related to confidentiality to protect our intellectual property. However, most of our intellectual property is not covered by any patents or patent applications. Moreover, there can be no assurance that any of our pending patent applications will issue or, in the case of patents issued or to be issued, that the claims allowed are or will be sufficient to protect our technology or processes. Even if all of our patent applications are issued, our patents may be challenged or invalidated. Patent applications filed in foreign countries may be subject to laws, rules and procedures that are substantially different from those of the United States, and any resulting foreign patents may be difficult and expensive to enforce.\nWhile we take steps to protect our proprietary rights to the extent possible, there can be no assurance that third parties will not know, discover or develop independently equivalent proprietary information or techniques, that they will not gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our trade secrets to the public. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that we can maintain and protect unpatented proprietary information and trade secrets. Misappropriation of our intellectual property could have an adverse effect on our competitive position and may cause us to incur substantial litigation costs.\nWe may be subject to claims that we infringe the intellectual property rights of others, and unfavorable outcomes could harm our business.\nOur future operations may be subject to claims, and potential litigation, arising from our alleged infringement of patents, trade secrets or copyrights owned by other third parties. We intend to fully comply with the law in avoiding such infringements. However, we may become subject to claims of infringement, including such claims or litigation initiated by existing, better-funded competitors. We could also become involved in disputes regarding the ownership of intellectual property rights that relate to our technologies. These disputes could arise out of collaboration relationships, strategic partnerships or other relationships. Any such litigation could be expensive, take significant time, and could divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. Our failure to prevail in any such legal proceedings, or even the mere occurrence of such legal proceedings, could substantially affect our ability to meet our expenses and continue operations.\nWe may engage in acquisitions that could disrupt our business, cause dilution to our stockholders and reduce our financial resources.\nIn the future, we may enter into transactions to acquire other businesses, products or technologies. If we do identify suitable candidates, we may not be able to make such acquisitions on favorable terms or at all. Any acquisitions we make may not strengthen our competitive position, and these transactions may be viewed negatively by customers or investors. We may decide to incur debt in connection with an acquisition or issue our common stock or other securities to the stockholders of the acquired company, which would reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders. We could incur losses resulting from undiscovered liabilities of the acquired business that are not covered by the indemnification we may obtain from the seller. In addition, we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired personnel, technologies and operations into our existing business in an effective, timely and non-disruptive manner. Acquisitions may also divert management from day-to-day responsibilities, increase our expenses and reduce our cash available for operations and other uses. We cannot predict the number, timing or size of future acquisitions or the effect that any such transactions might have on our operating results.\nWe have never paid cash dividends and do not intend to do so.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We currently plan to retain any earnings to finance the growth of our business rather than to pay cash dividends. Payments of any cash dividends in the future will depend on our financial condition, results of operations and capital requirements, as well as other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. Additionally, so long as any shares of our preferred stock our outstanding, we are prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock.", "PERMNO": 92155, "SIC": 3690, "TIC": "ESNC"}
