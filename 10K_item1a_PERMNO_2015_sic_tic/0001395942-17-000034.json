{"cik": "1395942", "company": "KAR Auction Services, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our Company involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to invest in our Company. The occurrence of any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, prospects, results of operations and cash flows. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. These risks are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe may not be successful in the implementation of our business strategy or we may improperly align new strategies with the Company\u2019s vision, which could lead to the misapplication of Company resources.\nOur strategy is to provide the best remarketing venue and analytical evidence for every vehicle. To execute our strategy, we are pursuing strategic initiatives that management considers critical to our long-term success, including but not limited to developing alternative marketplaces, establishing exceptional analytics capabilities, leveraging the Company's unique remarketing portfolio and data and growing the Company's buyer base. There are significant risks involved with the execution of these initiatives, including significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. Accordingly, we cannot predict whether we will succeed in implementing these strategic initiatives. For example, if we are unsuccessful in continuing to generate significant cash provided by operations (we generated $360.8 million and $475.0 million of cash flow from operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively), we may be unable to reinvest in our business, return capital to shareholders or reduce our outstanding indebtedness, which could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations and our ability to execute our other strategies. It could take several years to realize any direct financial benefits from these initiatives, if any direct financial benefits from these initiatives are achieved at all. Additionally, our business strategy may change from time to time, which could delay our ability to implement initiatives that we believe are important to our business.\nWe may not properly leverage or make the appropriate investment in technology advancements, which could result in the loss of any sustainable competitive advantage in products, services and processes.\nOur business is dependent on information technology. Robust information technology systems, platforms and products are critical to our operating environment, digital online products and competitive position. We may not be successful in structuring our information technology or developing, acquiring or implementing information systems which are competitive and responsive to the needs of our customers. We might lack sufficient resources to continue to make the significant investments in information technology to compete with our competitors. Certain information technology initiatives that management considers important to our long-term success will require capital investment, have significant risks associated with their execution, and could take several years to implement. We may not be able to develop/implement these initiatives in a cost-effective, timely manner or at all.\nCyber-security Environment\nInformation technology risks (including the confidentiality, integrity and availability of digital assets) for companies have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists and other external parties. These threats may derive from fraud or malice on the part of our employees or third parties, or may result from human error or accidental technological failure. Our customers and other parties in the payments value chain rely on our digital online products as well as other information technologies, computers, software and networks to conduct their operations. In addition, to access our online products and services, our customers increasingly use personal smartphones, tablet PCs and other mobile devices that may be beyond our control.\nWe are subject to cyber-threats and our information technology has been subject to cyber-attacks and we believe we will continue to be a potential target of such threats and attacks. In June 2015, we identified that unauthorized third parties had gained access to legacy servers containing archived data that would likely be considered to be personal information. We immediately investigated, including the engagement of an external expert security firm, and although we had no evidence that any information had been misused, stolen or compromised, we notified all of the individuals whose information may have been accessed and any applicable regulatory agencies. To date, this incident has not been material to our operations or financial results.\nContinuous cyber-attacks or a sustained attack could lead to service interruptions, malfunctions or other failures in the information technology that supports our businesses and customers (such as the lack of availability of our value-added systems), as well as the operations of our customers or other third parties. Continuous cyber-attacks could also lead to damage to our reputation with our customers and other parties and the market, additional costs (such as repairing systems, adding new personnel or protection technologies or compliance costs), regulatory penalties, financial losses to both us and our customers and partners and the loss of customers and business opportunities. If such attacks are not detected in a timely manner, their effect could be compounded.\nIf our information technology is compromised, becomes inoperable for extended periods of time or ceases to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace the information technology and our ability to provide many of our electronic and online solutions to our customers may be impaired, which would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results and financial position. In addition, as cyber-threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. Any of the risks described above could disrupt our business, damage our reputation and materially adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nIn addition, aspects of our operations and business are subject to privacy regulation in the United States and elsewhere. Many U.S. states have enacted data breach regulations and laws requiring varying levels of consumer notification in the event of a security breach. Increased regulation and enforcement activity throughout the world in the areas of data privacy and data security/breach may materially increase our costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Our failure to comply with the privacy and data security/breach laws to which we are subject could also result in fines, sanctions and damage to our reputation and tradenames or the loss of significant customers.\nIf we are not successful in competing with our known competitors, customers and/or disruptive new entrants, then our market position or competitive advantage could be threatened, as well as our business and results of operations.\nWe face significant competition for the supply of used and salvage vehicles, the buyers of those vehicles and the floorplan financing of these vehicles. Our principal sources of competition historically have come from: (1) direct competitors (e.g., Manheim, Copart and NextGear Capital), (2) new entrants, including new vehicle remarketing venues and dealer financing services, and (3) existing alternative vehicle remarketing venues. Due to the increasing use of the Internet and other technology as marketing and distribution channels, we also face increasing competition from online wholesale and retail vehicle selling platforms (generally without any meaningful physical presence) and from our own customers when they sell directly to end users through such platforms rather than remarket vehicles through our auctions and other channels. Increased competition could result in price reductions, reduced margins or loss of market share.\nOur future success also depends on our ability to respond to evolving industry trends, changes in customer requirements and new technologies. One potentially adverse trend would be a market shift towards the simultaneous listing and selling of vehicles on multiple online sales platforms. Were such a trend to take hold, the vehicle remarketing industry's economics could change. For example, we might need to incur additional costs or otherwise alter our business model to adapt to these changes. In such case, the volume of vehicles supplied to us and our overall revenues and fees per vehicle sold could decrease. Since 2013, many participants in the whole car industry have been discussing the development of a multiple platform bidding system. Any such collaboration may be unsuccessful, unworkable or deemed inadvisable. In such case, we may lose vehicle volume and market share, and our business, revenues and profitability could be negatively impacted.\nSome of our competitors may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do, may be able to respond more quickly to evolving industry dynamics and changes in customer requirements, or may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of new or emerging services and technologies. If we are unable to compete successfully or to successfully adapt to industry changes, our business, revenues and profitability could be materially adversely affected.\nADESA currently competes with online wholesale and retail vehicle selling platforms, including OVE.com and RMS Automotive (both affiliated with Cox Enterprises), SmartAuction, eBay Motors and others. With the exception of OVE.com, these online selling platforms generally do not have any meaningful physical presence and may cause the volume of vehicles sold through our online and physical auctions to decrease. If the number of vehicles sold through our auctions decreases due to these competitors or other industry changes, our revenue and profitability may be negatively impacted. In addition, our long-lived assets could also become subject to impairment.\nIn our salvage auction business, potential competitors include used vehicle auctions, providers of claims software to insurance companies and certain salvage buyer groups and automobile insurance companies, some of which currently supply salvage vehicles to us. Insurance companies may in the future decide to dispose of their salvage vehicles directly to end users, which would negatively affect our volumes, revenue and profitability.\nAt the national level, AFC's competition includes NextGear Capital, a subsidiary of Cox Enterprises, Inc., other specialty lenders, banks and financial institutions. At the local level, AFC faces competition from banks, credit unions and independent auctions who may offer floorplan financing to local auction customers. Such entities typically service only one or a small number of auctions. Some of our industry competitors who operate whole car auctions on a national scale may endeavor to capture a larger portion of the floorplan financing market. AFC competes primarily on the basis of quality of service, convenience of payment, scope of services offered and historical and consistent commitment to the sector. If the number of loans originated and serviced decreases due to these competitors, our revenue and profitability may be negatively impacted.\nIf we fail to attract and retain key personnel, or have inadequate succession planning, we may not be able to execute our business strategies and our financial results could be negatively affected.\nOur success depends in large part on the performance of our executive management team and other key employees, including key field and information technology personnel. If we lose the services of one or more of our executive officers or key employees, or if one or more of them decides to join a competitor or otherwise compete with us, we may not be able to effectively implement our business strategies, our business could suffer and the value of our common stock could be materially adversely affected. Our auction business is directly impacted by the business relationships our employees have established with customers and suppliers and, as a result, if we lose key personnel, we may have difficulty in retaining and attracting customers, developing new services, negotiating favorable agreements with customers and providing acceptable levels of customer service. Leadership changes will occur from time to time and we cannot predict whether significant resignations will occur or whether we will be able to recruit additional qualified personnel. We do not have nor do we currently expect to obtain key person insurance on any of our executive officers.\nWe may be unable to meet or exceed our customers\u2019 expectations, which could result in poor customer retention and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe believe our future success depends in part on our ability to respond to changes in customer requirements. Our customers include vehicle manufacturers and their captive finance arms, vehicle leasing and rental companies, financial institutions, fleet management companies, franchised and independent used vehicle dealers, insurance companies, non-profit organizations, automotive body shops, rebuilders, automotive wholesalers, exporters, dismantlers, recyclers and brokers. We work to develop strong relationships and interactive dialogue with our customers to better understand current trends and customer needs. If we are not successful in meeting our customers' expectations, our customer relationships could be negatively affected and result in a loss of future business, which would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nADESA and IAA's agreements with its largest institutional suppliers of used and salvage vehicles are generally subject to cancellation by either party upon 30 to 90 days' notice. In addition, it is common that institutional suppliers regularly review their relationships with whole car and salvage auctions through written requests for proposals. Such suppliers may from time to time require us to make changes to the way we do business as part of the request for proposal process. There can be no assurance that our existing agreements will not be canceled or that we will be able to enter into future agreements with these or other suppliers that disrupt our supplier base on similar terms, or at all, and our ability to grow and sustain profitability could be impaired.\nIf we acquire businesses that: are not aligned with the Company\u2019s strategy; lack the proper research and preparation; create unnecessary risks; improperly value and price a target; have poor integration execution; and/or do not achieve the desired outcomes, then our operating results, financial condition and growth prospects could be adversely affected.\nAcquisitions are a significant part of our growth strategy and have enabled us to further broaden and diversify our service offerings. Our strategy generally involves the acquisition and integration of additional physical auction sites, technologies and personnel. Acquisition of businesses requires substantial time and attention of management personnel and may also require additional equity or debt financings. Further, integration of newly established or acquired businesses is often disruptive. Since we have acquired or in the future may acquire one or more businesses, there can be no assurance that we will identify appropriate targets, will acquire such businesses on favorable terms, or will be able to successfully integrate such organizations into our business. Failure to do so could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we expect to compete against other auction groups or new industry consolidators for suitable acquisitions. If we are able to consummate acquisitions, such acquisitions could be dilutive to earnings, and we could overpay for such acquisitions.\nIn pursuing a strategy of acquiring other businesses, we face other risks including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nincurring significantly higher capital expenditures and operating expenses;\n\u2022\nentering new markets with which we are unfamiliar;\n\u2022\nincurring potential undiscovered liabilities at acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nfailing to maintain uniform standards, controls and policies;\n\u2022\nimpairing relationships with employees and customers as a result of management changes; and\n\u2022\nincreasing expenses for accounting and computer systems, as well as integration difficulties.\nAcquisitions and other strategies to expand our operations beyond North America subject us to significant risks and uncertainties. As a result, we may not be successful in realizing anticipated synergies or we may experience unanticipated integration expenses. As we continue to explore opportunities to expand our business internationally, we will need to develop policies and procedures to manage our business on a global scale. Operationally, acquired businesses typically depend on key relationships and our failure to maintain those relationships could have an adverse affect on our operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition, we anticipate that our non-U.S. based operations will continue to subject us to risks associated with operating on an international basis, including:\n\u2022\nexposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk, which may have an adverse impact on our revenues and profitability;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on our ability to repatriate funds, as well as repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions to the U.S. may result in higher effective tax rates;\n\u2022\ntariffs and trade barriers and other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to operate in certain foreign markets;\n\u2022\ncompliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u2022\ndealing with unfamiliar regulatory agencies and laws favoring local competitors;\n\u2022\ndealing with political and/or economic instability;\n\u2022\nthe difficulty of managing and staffing foreign offices, as well as the increased travel, infrastructure, legal and compliance costs associated with international operations;\n\u2022\nlocalizing our product offerings; and\n\u2022\nadapting to different business cultures and market structures.\nAs we continue to explore opportunities to expand globally, our success will depend on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with operating on an international basis. Our failure to manage these risks could have an adverse affect on our operating results and financial condition.\nDecreases in the supply of used vehicles coming to auction may impact auction sales volumes, which may adversely affect our revenues and profitability. In addition, a decrease in the number of used vehicles sold at physical auctions could adversely affect our revenue growth, operating results and financial condition.\nThe number of new and used vehicles that are leased by consumers affects the supply of vehicles coming to auction in future periods as the leases mature. If manufacturers and other lenders decrease the number of new vehicle lease originations and extend the terms of some of the existing leases, the number of off-lease vehicles available at auction for the industry would decline. If the supply of off-lease vehicles coming to auction declines, our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected.\nVolumes of off-lease vehicles in subsequent periods will be affected by total new vehicle sales and the future leasing behavior of manufacturers and lenders; therefore, we may not be able to accurately predict the volume of vehicles coming to auction. The supply of off-lease vehicles coming to auction is also affected by the market value of used vehicles compared to the residual value of those vehicles per the lease terms. In most cases, the lessee and the dealer have the ability to purchase the vehicle at the residual price at the end of the lease term. Generally, as market values of used vehicles rise, the number of vehicles purchased at residual value by the lessees and dealers increases, thus decreasing the number of off-lease vehicles available at auction.\nFurthermore, online only auction platforms were utilized for the sale of approximately 26% of vehicles sold by ADESA in 2016, compared with 24% in 2015. If sellers and buyers increase the number of vehicles transacted on online only auction platforms, our revenue per vehicle will likely decline. In connection with online auctions, ADESA offers physical auctions, which allow buyers to physically inspect and compare vehicles. In addition, our cost structure includes a significant fixed cost component, including occupancy costs, that cannot be readily reduced if revenue per vehicle declines. If a shift in the percentage of used vehicles sold on online only auction platforms as compared with used vehicles sold at physical auctions occurs, and we are unable to generate new sources of revenue, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nUsed vehicle prices impact fee revenue per unit and may impact the supply of used vehicles, as well as loan losses at AFC.\nThe volume of new vehicle production, accuracy of lease residual estimates, interest rate fluctuations, customer demand and changes in regulations, among other things, all potentially affect the pricing of used vehicles. Used vehicle prices may affect the volume of vehicles entered for sale at our auctions and the demand for those used vehicles, the fee revenue per unit, loan losses for our dealer financing business and our ability to retain customers. When used vehicle prices are high, used vehicle dealers may retail more of their trade-in vehicles on their own rather than selling them at auction. In addition, a sustained reduction in used vehicle pricing could result in lower proceeds from the sale of salvage vehicles and a related reduction in revenue per vehicle, a potential loss of consignors, an increase in loan losses at AFC and decreased profitability. Furthermore, when vehicles are purchased, we are subject to changes in vehicle values, such as those caused from changes in commodity prices for steel and platinum. Decreases in commodity prices may negatively affect vehicle values and demand at salvage auctions.\nIf our facilities lack the capacity to accept additional vehicles, then our relationships with insurance companies or other vehicle suppliers could be adversely affected.\nWe regularly evaluate our capacity in all our markets and where appropriate, seek to increase capacity through the acquisition of additional land and facilities. Capacity at our facilities varies from period to period and by region as a result of various factors, including natural disasters. We may not be able to reach agreements to purchase or lease storage facilities in markets where we have limited excess capacity, and zoning restrictions or difficulties obtaining use permits may limit our ability to expand our capacity through acquisitions of new land. In addition, we may not be able to renew or enter into new leases at commercially reasonable rates. If we fail to have sufficient capacity at one or more of our facilities, our relationships with insurance companies or other vehicle suppliers could be adversely affected, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nFluctuations in the supply of and demand for salvage vehicles impact auction sales volumes, which may adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nWe are dependent upon receiving a sufficient number of total loss vehicles to sustain profit margins in our salvage auction business. Factors that can adversely affect the number of vehicles received include, but are not limited to, a decrease in the number of vehicles in operation or miles driven, mild weather conditions that cause fewer traffic accidents, reduction of policy writing by insurance providers that would affect the number of claims over a period of time, changes in vehicle technology and autonomous vehicles, a decrease in the percentage of claims resulting in a total loss or elimination of automotive collision coverage by consumers, delays or changes in state title processing, government regulations on the standards for producing vehicles and changes in direct repair procedures that would reduce the number of newer, less damaged total loss vehicles, which tend to have higher salvage values. In addition, our salvage auction business depends on a limited number of automobile insurance companies to supply the salvage vehicles we sell at auction. Our agreements with these insurance company suppliers are generally subject to cancellation by either party upon 30 to 90 days\u2019 notice. There can be no assurance that our existing agreements will not be canceled or that we will be able to enter into future agreements with these suppliers. Future decreases in the quality and quantity of vehicle inventory, and in particular the availability of newer and less damaged vehicles, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. If the supply or value of salvage vehicles coming to\nauction declines significantly, our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected. In addition, decreases in commodity prices, such as steel and platinum, may negatively affect vehicle values and demand at salvage auctions.\nOur business and operating results would be adversely affected if we lose one or more significant customers.\nLoss of business from, or changes in the consignment patterns of, our key customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. Generally, institutional and dealer customers make no binding long-term commitments to us regarding consignment volumes. Any such customer could reduce its overall supply of vehicles for our auctions or otherwise seek to materially change the terms of its business relationship with us at any time. Any such change could harm our business and operating results. While no single customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenues in 2016, the loss of, or material reduction in business from, our key customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nAt a segment level, approximately 80% of IAA segment\u2019s revenues derive from insurance company customers and a small number of these customers account for a large share of IAA\u2019s revenues. In 2016, approximately 40% of IAA\u2019s revenues were associated with the fees generated from the auction of salvage vehicles, including buyer fees, from its three largest insurance customers, each of which accounted for over 10%. If one or more of IAA\u2019s large customers were to significantly reduce consignments for any reason or favor competitors or new entrants, IAA may not be successful in replacing such business and IAA\u2019s profitability and operating results would be materially adversely affected.\nAdverse economic conditions may negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nFuture adverse economic conditions could increase our exposure to several risks, including:\n\u2022\nFluctuations in the supply of used vehicles. We are dependent on the supply of used vehicles coming to auction, and our financial performance depends, in part, on conditions in the automotive industry. During the past global economic downturn and credit crisis, there was an erosion of retail demand for new and used vehicles that led many lenders to cut back on originations of new loans and leases and led to significant manufacturing capacity reductions by automakers selling vehicles in the United States and Canada. Capacity reductions could depress the number of vehicles received at auction in the future and could lead to reduced vehicles from various suppliers, negatively impacting auction volumes. In addition, weak growth in or declining new vehicle sales negatively impacts used vehicle trade-ins to dealers and auction volumes. These factors could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\n\u2022\nDecline in the demand for used vehicles. We may experience a decrease in demand for used vehicles from buyers due to factors including the lack of availability of consumer credit and declines in consumer spending and consumer confidence. Adverse credit conditions also affect the ability of dealers to secure financing to purchase used vehicles at auction, which further negatively affects buyer demand. In addition, a reduction in the number of franchised and independent used car dealers may reduce dealer demand for used vehicles.\n\u2022\nDecrease in consumer spending. Consumer purchases of new and used vehicles may be adversely affected by economic conditions such as employment levels, wage and salary levels, trends in consumer confidence and spending, reductions in consumer net worth, interest rates, inflation, the availability of consumer credit and taxation policies. Consumer purchases in general may decline during recessions, periods of prolonged declines in the equity markets or housing markets and periods when disposable income and perceptions of consumer wealth are lower. Changes to U.S. federal tax policy may negatively affect consumer spending. In addition, the increased use of vehicle sharing and alternate methods of transportation, including autonomous vehicles, could lead to a decrease in consumer purchases of new and used vehicles and a decrease in vehicle rentals. To the extent retail and rental car company demand for new and used vehicles decreases, negatively impacting our auction volumes, our results of operations and financial position could be materially and adversely affected.\n\u2022\nVolatility in the asset-backed securities market. Volatility and disruption in the asset-backed commercial paper market could lead to a narrowing of interest rate spreads at AFC in certain periods. In addition, any volatility and disruption has affected, and could affect, AFC\u2019s cost of financing related to its securitization facility.\n\u2022\nAbility to service and refinance indebtedness. Uncertainty in the financial markets may negatively affect our ability to service our existing debt, access additional financing or to refinance our existing indebtedness on favorable terms or at all. If economic weakness exists, it may affect our cash flow from operations and results of operations, which may affect our ability to service payment obligations on our debt or to comply with our debt covenants.\n\u2022\nIncreased counterparty credit risk. Any market deterioration could increase the risk of the failure of financial institutions party to our Credit Agreement and other counterparties with which we do business to honor their obligations to us. Our ability to replace any such obligations on the same or similar terms may be limited if challenging credit and general economic conditions exist.\nDeclining values for salvage vehicles purchased could adversely affect our profitability.\nIn the United Kingdom, the salvage market typically operates on a principal basis, in which a vehicle is purchased and then resold, rather than on an agent basis, in which the auction acts as a sales agent for the owner of the vehicle. Operating on a principal basis exposes us to inventory risks, including losses from theft, damage and obsolescence. Furthermore, in periods when the supply of vehicles from the insurance sector in North America declines, salvage operators have acquired and in the future may acquire vehicles on their own. If we purchase vehicles, the increased costs associated with acquiring the vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our gross profit and operating results. In addition, when vehicles are purchased, we are subject to changes in vehicle values, such as those caused from changes in commodity prices for steel and platinum. Decreases in commodity prices may negatively affect vehicle values and demand at salvage auctions.\nAFC is exposed to credit risk with our dealer borrowers, which could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.\nAFC is subject to credit risk resulting from defaults in payment by our dealer customers on our floorplan loans. Furthermore, a weak economic environment, decreased demand for used vehicles, disruptions in pricing of used vehicle inventory or consumers\u2019 lack of access to financing could exert pressure on our dealer customers resulting in higher delinquencies, bankruptcies, repossessions and credit losses. There can be no assurances that our monitoring of our credit risk as it affects the collectability of these loans and our efforts to mitigate credit risk through appropriate underwriting policies and loss-mitigation strategies are, or will be, sufficient to prevent an adverse impact in our profitability and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent, trade secret, and domain name protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. In the United States and internationally, we have filed various applications for protection of certain aspects of our intellectual property, and we currently hold issued patents in the United States. However, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our proprietary rights, third parties may challenge proprietary rights held by us, and pending and future trademark and patent applications may not be approved. In addition, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we operate or intend to operate our business. In any or all of these cases, we may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or to enforce our rights. Although we have taken measures to protect our proprietary rights, there can be no assurance that others will not offer products or concepts that are substantially similar to ours and compete with our business. If the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished and competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nWe may be subject to patent or other intellectual property infringement claims, which could have an impact on our business or operating results due to a disruption in our business operations, the incurrence of significant costs and other factors.\nFrom time to time, we may receive notices from others claiming that we infringed or otherwise violated their patent or intellectual property rights, and the number of these claims could increase in the future. Claims of intellectual property infringement or other intellectual property violations could require us to enter into licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur substantial monetary liability or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question, which could require us to change business practices and limit our ability to compete effectively. Even if we believe that the claims are without merit, the claims can be time-consuming and costly to defend and may divert management\u2019s attention and resources away from our businesses. If we are required to take any of these actions, it could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results.\nWeather-related and other events beyond our control may adversely impact operations.\nExtreme weather or other events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, forest fires, floods, terrorist attacks or war, may adversely affect the overall economic environment, the markets in which we compete, our operations and profitability. These events may impact our physical auction facilities, causing a material increase in costs, or delays or cancellation of auction sales, which could have a material adverse impact on our revenues and profitability. In some instances, for example with the severe storm in October 2012, known as \u201cSuperstorm Sandy,\u201d these events may result in a sharp influx in the available supply of salvage vehicles and there can be no assurance that our salvage auction business will have sufficient resources to handle such extreme increases in supply. Our failure to meet our customers\u2019 demands in such situations could negatively affect our relationships with such customers and result in a loss of future business, which would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. In addition, salvage revenues generated as a result of the total loss of vehicles associated with such a catastrophe are typically recognized subsequent to the incurrence of incremental costs and such revenues may not be sufficient to offset the costs incurred.\nMild weather conditions tend to result in a decrease in the available supply of salvage vehicles because traffic accidents decrease and fewer vehicles are damaged. Accordingly, mild weather can have an adverse effect on our salvage vehicle inventories, which would be expected to have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating results and related growth rates.\nA portion of our net income is derived from our international operations, primarily Canada, which exposes us to foreign exchange risks that may impact our financial statements. In addition, increases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies may negatively impact foreign buyer participation at our auctions.\nFluctuations between U.S. and foreign currency values may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position, particularly fluctuations with Canadian currency values. In addition, there may be tax inefficiencies in repatriating cash from Canada. Approximately 11% of our revenues were attributable to our Canadian operations for the year ended December 31, 2016. A decrease in the value of the Canadian currency relative to the U.S. dollar would reduce our profits from Canadian operations and the value of the net assets of our Canadian operations when reported in U.S. dollars in our financial statements. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations as reported in U.S. dollars. A 1% change in the average Canadian exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 would have impacted net income by approximately $0.9 million.\nIn addition, fluctuations in exchange rates may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations. For purposes of accounting, the assets and liabilities of our Canadian operations are translated using period-end exchange rates; such translation gains and losses are reported in \u201cAccumulated other comprehensive income/loss\u201d as a component of stockholders\u2019 equity. The revenues and expenses of our Canadian operations are translated using average exchange rates during each period.\nLikewise, we have a significant number of non-U.S. based buyers who participate in our auctions. Increases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to these buyers\u2019 local currencies may reduce the prices they are willing to pay at auction, which may negatively affect our revenues.\nIncreases in fuel prices could lead to a reduction in miles driven and may have an adverse effect on our revenues and operating results, as well as our earnings growth rates.\nIncreased fuel prices could lead to a reduction in the miles driven per vehicle, which may reduce accident rates. Increases in fuel prices may also disproportionately affect the demand for sports cars, luxury vehicles, sport utility and full-sized vehicles which are generally not as fuel-efficient as smaller vehicles. Retail sales and accident rates are factors that affect the number of used and salvage vehicles sold at auction, wholesale prices of those vehicles and the conversion rates at used vehicle auctions. Additionally, higher fuel costs increase the cost of transportation and towing of vehicles and we may not be able to pass on such higher costs to our customers.\nEnvironmental, health and safety risks could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nOur operations are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing the emission or discharge of pollutants into the air or water, the generation, treatment, storage and release of hazardous materials and wastes and the investigation and remediation of contamination. Our failure to comply with current or future environmental, health or safety laws or to obtain and comply with permits required under such laws, could subject us to significant liability or require costly investigative, remedial or corrective actions.\nIn the used vehicle remarketing industry, large numbers of vehicles, including wrecked vehicles at salvage auctions, are stored and/or refurbished at auction facilities and during that time minor releases of fuel, motor oil and other materials may occur. We have investigated or remediated, or are currently investigating or remediating, contamination resulting from various sources, including gasoline, fuel additives (such as methyl tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE), motor oil, petroleum products and other hazardous materials released from aboveground or underground storage tanks or in connection with current or former operations conducted at our facilities. We have incurred and may in the future incur expenditures relating to releases of hazardous materials, investigative, remedial or corrective actions, claims by third parties and other environmental issues, and such expenditures, individually or in the aggregate, could be significant.\nFederal and state environmental authorities are currently investigating IAA\u2019s role in contributing to contamination at the Lower Duwamish Waterway Superfund Site in Seattle, Washington. IAA\u2019s potential liability at this site cannot be estimated at this time. See Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d for a further discussion of this matter.\nWe have a substantial amount of debt, which could impair our financial condition and adversely affect our ability to react to changes in our business.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our total corporate debt was approximately $2.5 billion, exclusive of liabilities related to our securitization facilities which are not secured by the general assets of KAR, and we had $219.5 million of borrowing capacity under our senior secured credit facilities. In addition, we had related outstanding letters of credit in the aggregate amount of $29.7 million at December 31, 2016, which would reduce the $219.5 million available for borrowings under the credit facilities.\nOur indebtedness could have important consequences including:\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional amounts to fund working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy, acquisitions and other purposes;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on debt, which would reduce the funds available for other purposes, including funding future expansion;\n\u2022\nmaking us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions, in government regulation and in our business by limiting our flexibility in planning for, and making it more difficult to react quickly to, changing conditions; and\n\u2022\nexposing us to risks inherent in interest rate fluctuations because the majority of our indebtedness is at variable rates of interest, which could result in higher interest expenses in the event of increases in interest rates.\nIn addition, if we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations to service our debt and meet other cash needs, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, suspend or eliminate dividends, sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to refinance our debt or sell additional debt or equity securities or our assets on favorable terms, if at all, particularly because of our high levels of debt and the restrictions imposed by the agreement governing our Credit Facility on our ability to incur additional debt and use the proceeds from asset sales. If we must sell certain of our assets, it may negatively affect our ability to generate revenue. The inability to obtain additional financing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we would be in default and, as a result:\n\u2022\nour debt holders could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable;\n\u2022\nthe lenders under our senior secured credit facilities could terminate their commitments to lend us money and foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings; and\n\u2022\nwe could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nFurthermore, the agreement governing our Credit Facility includes, and future debt instruments may include, certain restrictive covenants which could limit our ability to enter into certain transactions in the future and may adversely affect our ability to operate our business.\nChanges in interest rates or market conditions could adversely impact the profitability and business of AFC.\nRising interest rates may have the effect of depressing the sales of used vehicles because many consumers finance their vehicle purchases. In addition, AFC securitizes a majority of its finance receivables on a revolving basis. Volatility and/or market disruption in the asset-backed securities market in the United States or Canada can impact AFC\u2019s cost of financing related to, or its ability to arrange financing on acceptable terms through, its securitization facility, which could negatively affect AFC\u2019s business and our financial condition and operations.\nWe assume the settlement risk for all vehicles sold through our auctions.\nWe do not have recourse against sellers for any buyer\u2019s failure to satisfy its payment obligations. Since revenue for most vehicles does not include the gross sales proceeds, failure to collect the receivables in full may result in a net loss up to the gross sales proceeds on a per vehicle basis in addition to any expenses incurred to collect the receivables and to provide the services associated with the vehicle. If we are unable to collect payments on a large number of vehicles, the resulting payment obligations to the seller and decreased fee revenues may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in laws affecting the importation of salvage vehicles may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nOur Internet-based auction services have allowed us to offer our products and services to international markets and has increased our international buyer base. As a result, foreign buyers of salvage vehicles now represent a significant part of our total buyer base. Changes in laws and regulations that restrict the importation of salvage vehicles into foreign countries may reduce the demand for salvage vehicles and impact our ability to maintain or increase our international buyer base. For example, a decree issued by the president of Mexico has placed restrictions on the types of vehicles that can be imported into Mexico from the United States. The adoption of similar laws or regulations in other jurisdictions that have the effect of reducing or curtailing our activities abroad could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition by reducing the demand for our products and services.\nWe are subject to extensive governmental regulations, including vehicle brokerage and auction laws and currency reporting obligations. Our business is subject to risks related to litigation and regulatory actions.\nOur operations are subject to regulation, supervision and licensing under various federal, state, provincial and local authorities, agencies, statutes and ordinances, which, among other things, require us to obtain and maintain certain licenses, permits and qualifications, provide certain disclosures and notices and limit interest rates, fees and other charges. The regulations and laws that impact our company include, without limitation, the following:\n\u2022\nThe acquisition and sale of used, leased, totaled and recovered theft vehicles are regulated by state or other local motor vehicle departments in each of the locations in which we operate.\n\u2022\nSome of the transport vehicles used at our auctions are regulated by the U.S. Department of Transportation or similar regulatory agencies in the other countries in which we operate.\n\u2022\nIn many states and provinces, regulations require that a salvage vehicle be forever \u201cbranded\u201d with a salvage notice in order to notify prospective purchasers of the vehicle\u2019s previous salvage status.\n\u2022\nSome state, provincial and local regulations limit who can purchase salvage vehicles, as well as determine whether a salvage vehicle can be sold as rebuildable or must be sold for parts or scrap only.\n\u2022\nAFC is subject to laws in certain states and in Canada which regulate commercial lending activities and interest rates and, in certain jurisdictions, require AFC or one of its subsidiaries to be licensed.\n\u2022\nPWI is subject to laws, regulations and insurance licensing requirements in certain states which are applicable to the sale of vehicle service contracts.\n\u2022\nWe are subject to various local zoning requirements with regard to the location of our auction and storage facilities, which requirements vary from location to location.\n\u2022\nCertain of the Company's subsidiaries are indirectly subject to the regulations of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010, or the CFPA, due to their vendor relationships with financial institutions.\n\u2022\nPAR is subject to laws in certain states which regulate repossession administration activities and, in certain jurisdictions, require PAR to be licensed.\n\u2022\nWe deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations.\nChanges in law or governmental regulations or interpretations of existing law or regulations could result in increased costs, reduced vehicle prices and decreased profitability for us. In addition, failure to comply with present or future laws and regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or in their interpretation could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nWe are also subject from time to time to a variety of legal actions relating to our current and past business operations, including litigation relating to employment-related issues, the environment and personal injury claims. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves in legal and administrative actions or in asserting our rights under various laws. In addition, we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves or in asserting our rights in such actions. The costs and other effects of pending litigation and administrative actions against us cannot be determined with certainty. Although we currently believe that no such proceedings will have a material adverse effect, there can be no assurance that the outcome of such proceedings will be as expected.\nWe are partially self-insured for certain losses.\nWe self-insure a portion of employee medical benefits under the terms of our employee health insurance program, as well as a portion of our automobile, general liability and workers\u2019 compensation claims. We record an accrual for the claims expense related to our employee medical benefits, automobile, general liability and workers\u2019 compensation claims based upon the expected amount of all such claims. If actual trends, including the severity of claims and medical cost inflation above expectations were to occur, our self-insured costs would increase, which could have an adverse impact on the operating results in that period.\nWe are dependent on the continued and uninterrupted service from our workforce.\nCurrently, none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. If we negotiate a first-time collective bargaining agreement, we could be subject to a substantial increase in labor and benefits expenses that we may be unable to pass through to customers for some period of time, if at all.\nWe have a material amount of goodwill which, if it becomes impaired, would result in a reduction in our net income.\nGoodwill represents the amount by which the cost of an acquisition accounted for using the purchase method exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired. Current accounting standards require that goodwill no longer be amortized but instead be periodically evaluated for impairment based on the fair value of the reporting unit. A significant percentage of our total assets represents goodwill. Declines in our profitability or the value of comparable companies may impact the fair value of our reporting units, which could result in a write-down of goodwill and a reduction in net income.\nNew accounting pronouncements or new interpretations of existing standards could require us to make adjustments to accounting policies that could adversely affect the financial statements.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board, or the FASB, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the SEC, and other accounting organizations or governmental entities from time to time issue new pronouncements or new interpretations of existing accounting and auditing standards that require changes to our accounting policies and procedures and could cause us to incur additional costs. To date, we do not believe any new pronouncements or interpretations have had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, but future pronouncements or interpretations could require the change of policies or procedures.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile, which could result in rapid and substantial losses for our stockholders.\nYou should consider an investment in our common stock to be risky, and you should invest in our common stock only if you can withstand a significant loss and wide fluctuations in the market value of your investment. Many factors could cause the market price of our common stock to rise and fall, including the following:\n\u2022\nour announcements or our competitors\u2019 announcements regarding new products or services, enhancements, significant contracts, acquisitions or strategic investments;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts, if any, who cover our common stock;\n\u2022\nresults of operations that are below our announced guidance or below securities analysts\u2019 or consensus estimates or expectations;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our quarterly financial results or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022\nchanges in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities, sales of large blocks of common stock by our stockholders or our incurrence of additional debt;\n\u2022\nrepurchases of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program;\n\u2022\ninvestors\u2019 general perception of us and our industry;\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic and market conditions;\n\u2022\nchanges in industry conditions; and\n\u2022\nchanges in regulatory and other dynamics.\nIn addition, if the market for stocks in our industry, or the stock market in general, experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition or results of operations. If any of the foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to lawsuits that, even if successfully defended, could be costly to defend and a distraction to management.\nFuture offerings of debt or equity securities, which would rank senior to our common stock, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIf, in the future, we decide to issue debt or equity securities that rank senior to our common stock, it is likely that such securities will be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility. Additionally, any convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our common stock and may result in dilution to owners of our common stock. We and, indirectly, our stockholders, will bear the cost of issuing and servicing such securities. Because our decision to issue debt or equity securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, holders of our common stock will bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting the value of their stock holdings in us.\nThe market price of our common stock could be negatively affected by sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market.\nFuture sales by us or by our existing stockholders of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales may occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. These sales also could impede our ability to raise future capital. Under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, we are authorized to issue up to 400,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 136,639,217 shares of common stock were outstanding as of December 31, 2016. In addition, pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act, we have registered shares of common stock reserved for issuance in respect of stock options and other incentive awards granted to our officers and certain of\nour employees. If any of these holders cause a large number of securities to be sold in the public market, the sales could reduce the trading price of our common stock. We cannot predict the size of future sales of shares of our common stock or the effect, if any, that future sales, or the perception that such sales may occur, would have on the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws, and of Delaware law, may prevent or delay an acquisition of us, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain provisions that may be considered to have an anti-takeover effect and may delay or prevent a tender offer or other corporate transaction that a stockholder might consider to be in its best interest, including those transactions that might result in a premium over the market price for our shares.\nThese provisions include:\n\u2022\nrules regarding how our stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\npermitting our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval;\n\u2022\ngranting to the board of directors, and not the stockholders, the sole power to set the number of directors;\n\u2022\nauthorizing vacancies on our board of directors to be filled only by a vote of the majority of the directors then in office and specifically denying our stockholders the right to fill vacancies in the board;\n\u2022\nauthorizing the removal of directors only upon the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote for the election of directors; and\n\u2022\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent.\nThese provisions apply even if an offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders.\nYou may not receive any future dividends on our common stock.\nOn November 30, 2012, we announced that our board of directors approved the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock. Holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. We are not required to declare cash dividends on our common stock. Future dividend decisions will be based on and affected by a variety of factors, including our financial condition and results of operations, contractual restrictions, including restrictive covenants contained in our Credit Agreement and AFC\u2019s securitization facilities, capital requirements and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant. Therefore, no assurance can be given as to whether any future dividends may be declared by our board of directors or the amount thereof.\nOur share repurchase program could affect the price of our common stock and increase volatility. In addition, it may be suspended or discontinued at any time, which could result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock.\nRepurchases of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility. The existence of a share repurchase program could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. There can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased the shares of common stock. Although our share repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program's effectiveness. Furthermore, the program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares of common stock, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time, which could cause the market price of our stock to decline.\nIn October 2014, our board of directors authorized a repurchase of up to $300 million of the Company\u2019s outstanding\ncommon stock through October 28, 2016. Approximately $227.6 million of the Company's common stock was repurchased under the October 2014 authorization. In October 2016, our board of directors authorized a repurchase of up to $500 million of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock through October 26, 2019. As of December 31, 2016, approximately $80.4 million of the Company's common stock had been repurchased under the October 2016 authorization. No assurance can be given as to whether the board of directors will authorize additional shares for repurchase, which could cause the market value of our stock to decline.", "PERMNO": 93174, "SIC": 7389, "TIC": "KAR"}
