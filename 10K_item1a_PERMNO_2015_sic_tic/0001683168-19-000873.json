RISK FACTORS.\nOur results of operations, financial condition and cash flows can be adversely affected by various risks. These risks include, but are not limited to, the principal factors listed below and the other matters set forth in this annual report on Form 10-K. You should carefully consider all of these risks.\nRisks Relating to Our Financial Results and Need for Financing\nWe have a history of operating losses and an accumulated deficit and expect to continue to incur operating losses and negative operating cash flows for one year beyond the date of these financial statements, and as a result, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nSince inception through December 31, 2018, we have incurred cumulative losses of $123,171,406 and have never generated enough funds through operations to support our business. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we had an operating cash flow deficit of $3,945,742 from continuing operations. The Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon generating profitable operations in the future and obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. We have not identified, and cannot be certain we will be able to identify, a course of action that guarantees the achievement of profitable operations in the foreseeable future. Further, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to secure such financing at commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If cash resources become insufficient to meet the Company\u2019s ongoing obligations, the Company will be required to scale back or discontinue portions of its operations or discontinue operations entirely, whereby, the Company\u2019s shareholders may lose some or all of their investment. Accordingly, and in light of the Company\u2019s historic and continuing losses, there is substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe Company\u2019s Board is working with an investment bank to identify strategic alternatives available in an effort to maximize shareholder value, including but not limited to, a sale of the Company, a merger or other business combination, a sale of all or substantially all assets, a joint venture or equity and debt refinancing. At April 1, 2019, no definitive alternatives had been identified.\nWe have a limited number of shares of common stock available for future issuance which could adversely affect our ability to raise capital or consummate acquisitions.\nWe are currently authorized to issue 190,000,000 shares of common stock under our Amended Restated and Articles of Incorporation. As of March 2019, we have issued 134,793,211 shares of common stock and have approximately 8,147,955 shares of common stock committed for issuance giving effect to the assumed exercise of all outstanding warrants and options and assumed conversion of preferred stock. Due to the limited number of authorized shares available for issuance, we may not able to raise additional equity capital or complete a merger or other business combination unless we increase the number of shares we are authorized to issue. We would need to seek stockholder approval to increase the number of our authorized shares of common stock. We can provide no assurance that we will succeed in amending our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation to increase the number of shares of common stock we are authorized to issue.\nOur failure to comply with covenants under debt instruments could trigger prepayment obligations or other penalties.\nOur failure to comply with the covenants under our debt instruments could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in us being required to repay these borrowings before their due date or could result in other penalties. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to secure financing to refinance these borrowings at commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we are unable to secure such financing and cash resources become insufficient to meet the Company\u2019s ongoing obligations, the Company will be required to scale back or discontinue portions of its operations or discontinue operations entirely, whereby, the Company\u2019s shareholders may lose some or all of their investment.\nIf we fail to remain current on our reporting requirements, we could be removed from the OTC Bulletin Board, which would limit the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and the ability of stockholders to sell their securities in the secondary market.\nCompanies trading on the OTC Bulletin Board, such as us, must be reporting issuers under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), and must be current in their reports under Section 13 of the Exchange Act in order to maintain price quotation privileges on the OTC Bulletin Board. If we fail to remain current on our reporting requirements, we could be removed from the OTC Bulletin Board. As a result, the market liquidity for our securities could be adversely affected by limiting the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and the ability of stockholders to sell their securities in the secondary market.\nRisks Relating to the Ownership of Our Common Stock\nIf the Company is unable to continue as a going concern, the Company\u2019s shareholders may lose some or all of their investment.\nAs discussed above, we have a history of operating losses and an accumulated deficit and expect to continue to incur operating losses and negative operating cash flows for one year beyond the date of these financial statements, and as a result, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If cash resources become insufficient to meet the Company\u2019s ongoing obligations and we are unable to secure financing at commercially reasonable terms, if at all, the Company will be required to scale back or discontinue portions of its operations or discontinue operations entirely, whereby, the Company\u2019s shareholders may lose some or all of their investment.\nOur common stock is thinly traded and there may not be an active trading market for our common stock.\nOur common stock is currently quoted on the OTCQB, operated by the OTC Markets Group. However, there is no guarantee that our common stock will be actively traded on the OTCQB, or that the volume of trading will be sufficient to allow for timely trades. Investors may not be able to sell their shares quickly or at the latest market price if trading in our stock is not active or if trading volume is limited. In addition, if trading volume in our common stock is limited, trades of relatively small numbers of shares may have a disproportionate effect on the market price of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors. Some of the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include:\n\u00b7 fluctuations in our quarterly financial and operating results or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us;\n\u00b7 changes in estimates of our financial results or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u00b7 potential deterioration of investor confidence resulting from material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting;\n\u00b7 our ability to raise and generate working capital to meet our obligations in the ordinary course of business;\n\u00b7 changes in general economic, industry and market conditions;\n\u00b7 failure of any of our products to achieve or maintain market acceptance;\n\u00b7 changes in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u00b7 failure of our products to operate as advertised;\n\u00b7 success of competitive products;\n\u00b7 changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;\n\u00b7 announcements by us or our competitors of significant products, contracts, acquisitions or strategic alliances;\n\u00b7 regulatory developments in the United States, foreign countries or both;\n\u00b7 litigation involving our Company, our general industry or both;\n\u00b7 additions or departures of key personnel; and\n\u00b7 investors\u2019 general perception of us.\nIn addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition or results of operations. If any of the foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to class action lawsuits that, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and a distraction to management.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Utah law could discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our Company and may affect the trading price of our common stock.\nWe are a Utah corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Utah Control Shares Acquisition Act may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control by limiting the voting rights of control shares acquired in a control share acquisition. In addition, our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that shareholders may consider favorable. Among other things, our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws:\n\u00b7 authorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors in response to a takeover attempt;\n\u00b7 provide that vacancies on our board of directors, including newly created directorships, may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office, except a vacancy occurring by reason of the removal of a director without cause shall be filled by vote of the shareholders; and\n\u00b7 limit who may call special meetings of shareholders.\nThese provisions could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, whether or not it is desired by, or beneficial to, our shareholders.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock\nWe do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock. Any future dividend payments are within the absolute discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, working capital requirements, capital expenditure requirements, financial condition, contractual restrictions, business opportunities, anticipated cash needs, provisions of applicable law and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. We may not generate sufficient cash from operations in the future to pay dividends on our common stock.\nOur common stock is subject to \u201cPenny Stock\u201d restrictions.\nAs long as the price of our common stock remains at less than $5 per share, we will be subject to so-called \u201cpenny stock rules\u201d which could decrease our stock\u2019s market liquidity. The Security and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) has adopted regulations which define a \u201cpenny stock\u201d to include any equity security that has a market price of less than $5 per share or an exercise price of less than $5 per share, subject to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require the delivery to and execution by the retail customer of a written declaration of suitability relating to the penny stock, which must include disclosure of the commissions payable to both the broker/dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, the broker/dealer must send monthly statements disclosing recent price information for the penny stocks held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks. Those requirements could adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock. There can be no assurance that the price of our common stock will rise above $5 per share so as to avoid these regulations.\nFurther issuances of equity securities may be dilutive to current stockholders.\nIt is possible that we will be required to seek additional capital in the near term. This capital funding could involve one or more types of equity securities, including convertible debt, common or convertible preferred stock and warrants to acquire common or preferred stock. Such equity securities could be issued at or below the then-prevailing market price for our common stock. Any issuance of additional shares of our common stock will be dilutive to existing stockholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe exercise of conversion rights, options and warrants outstanding and available for issuance may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had outstanding employee options to purchase a total of 3,349,793 shares of common stock at exercise prices ranging from $0.14 to $1.00 per share, with a weighted average exercise price of $0.16. As of December 31, 2018, we had warrants outstanding to purchase a total of 250,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.20 per share. The exercise of outstanding options and warrants and the sale in the public market of the shares purchased upon such exercise could be dilutive to existing stockholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nNew tariffs and evolving trade policy between the United States and China may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nDuring 2018, the United States Federal Government imposed significant tariffs on imports from numerous countries, including China. Subsequent to this, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (\u201cUSTR\u201d) announced an initial proposed list of imports from China that could be subject to additional tariffs. The list of imports for which Customs and Border Protection began collecting additional duties during July 2018, focuses on the industrial sector. The Company\u2019s main supplier, accounting for approximately 80% of total purchases, is located in China. The products that the Company purchases from the supplier are subject to up to 25% tariffs. As a result of the tariffs, our cost of sales has increased.\nThe current administration, along with Congress, has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United States and other countries with respect to the trade policies, treaties, taxes, government regulations and tariffs that would be applicable. It is unclear what changes might be considered or implemented and what response to any such changes may be by the governments of other countries. These changes have created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United States and China, as well as other countries, including with respect to the trade policies, treaties, government regulations and tariffs that could apply to trade between the United States and other nations. If significant tariffs or other restrictions are placed on Chinese imports or any related counter-measures are taken by China, our revenue and results of operations may be materially harmed. Even in the absence of further tariffs, the related uncertainty and the market's fear of an escalating trade war might create forecasting difficulties for us and cause our customers and business partners to place fewer orders for our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations.\nThese developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, may have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and may significantly reduce global trade and, in particular, trade between these nations and the United States. Any of these factors could depress economic activity and restrict our access to suppliers or customers and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and affect our strategy in China and elsewhere around the world. Given the relatively fluid regulatory environment in China and the United States and uncertainty how the U.S. Administration or foreign governments will act with respect to tariffs, international trade agreements and policies, a trade war, further governmental action related to tariffs or international trade policies, or additional tax or other regulatory changes in the future could directly and adversely impact our financial results and results of operations.\nWe rely on a limited number of third party suppliers. If these companies fail to perform or experience delays, shortages, or increased demand for their products or services, we may face shortages, increased costs, and may be required to suspend deployment of our products and services.\nWe depend on a limited number of third party suppliers to provide the components and the equipment required to deliver our solutions, with purchases from one supplier comprising approximately 81% of total purchases for the year ended December 31, 2018. If these providers fail to perform their obligations under our agreements with them or we are unable to renew these agreements, we may be forced to suspend the sale and deployment of our products and services and enrollment of new customers, which would have an adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nThe industry within which we operate is intensely competitive and rapidly evolving.\nWe operate in a highly competitive, quickly changing environment, and our future success will depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products and product enhancements that achieve broad market acceptance in the markets within which we compete. We will also need to respond effectively to new product announcements by our competitors by quickly developing and introducing competitive products.\nDelays in product development and introduction could result in:\n\u00b7 loss of or delay in revenue and loss of market share;\n\u00b7 negative publicity and damage to our reputation and the reputation of our product offerings; and\n\u00b7 decline in the average selling price of our products.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls as of December 31, 2018 that, if not properly remediated, could result in material misstatements in our financial statements.\nBased on an evaluation of our disclosure of internal controls and procedures as of December 31, 2018, our management has concluded that, as of such date, there were material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting related to a lack of segregation of duties due to the limited size of the Company\u2019s accounting department, a failure to implement adequate internal control over financial reporting including in our IT general control environment and the need for a stronger internal control environment particularly in our financial reporting and close process. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements would not be prevented or detected. As disclosed in Item 9A of Part II of this report, because of the material weaknesses identified by the Company, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements that would require restatement of the Company\u2019s financial results in this report. Management of the Company believes that these material weaknesses are due to the small size of the Company\u2019s accounting staff. The small size of the Company\u2019s accounting staff may prevent adequate controls in the future, such as segregation of duties, due to the cost/benefit of such remediation. At present, the Company does not expect to hire additional personnel to remediate these control deficiencies in the near future. We are reviewing other potential actions to remediate the identified material weaknesses.\nUntil and if these material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting are remediated, there is reasonable possibility that material misstatements of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements could occur and not be prevented or detected by our internal controls in a timely manner. Material misstatements in our financial statements could result in litigation or regulatory enforcement actions, which would require additional financial and management resources; loss of investor confidence; and delays in filing required financial disclosures, one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. The Company believes the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 are free of material misstatements.\nGovernment regulation of our products could impair our ability to sell such products in certain markets.\nThe rules of the FCC permit the operation of unlicensed digital devices that radiate radio frequency emissions if the manufacturer complies with certain equipment authorization procedures, technical requirements, marketing restrictions and product labeling requirements. Differing technical requirements apply to \u201cClass A\u201d devices intended for use in commercial settings, and \u201cClass B\u201d devices intended for residential use to which more stringent standards apply. An independent, FCC-certified testing lab has verified that our product suite complies with the FCC technical requirements for Class A and Class B digital devices. No further testing of these devices is required, and the devices may be manufactured and marketed for commercial and residential use. Additional devices designed by us for commercial and residential use will be subject to the FCC rules for unlicensed digital devices. Moreover, if in the future, the FCC changes its technical requirements for unlicensed digital devices, further testing and/or modifications of devices may be necessary. Failure to comply with any FCC technical requirements could impair our ability to sell our products in certain markets and could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.\nProducts sold by our competitors could become more popular than our products or render our products obsolete.\nThe market for our products and services is highly competitive. Some of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition and substantially greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources. These competitors may, among other things, undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies, obtain more favorable pricing from suppliers and manufacturers and exert more influence on the sales channel than we can. As a result, we may not be able to compete successfully with these competitors, and these competitors may develop or market technologies and products that are more widely accepted than those being developed by us or that would render our products obsolete or noncompetitive. We anticipate that competitors will also intensify their efforts to penetrate our target markets. These competitors may have more advanced technology, more extensive distribution channels, stronger brand names, bigger promotional budgets and larger customer bases than we do. These companies could devote more capital resources to develop, manufacture and market competing products than we could. If any of these companies are successful in competing against us, our sales could decline, our margins could be negatively impacted, and we could lose market share, any of which could seriously harm our business, results of operations, and prospects.\nWe may incur substantial damages due to litigation.\nWe cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of others. If it were determined that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of another, we could be required to pay substantial damages or be enjoined from licensing or using the infringing products or technology. Additionally, if it were determined that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of others, we would need to obtain licenses from these parties or substantially re-engineer our products in order to avoid infringement. We might not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms or at all, or to re-engineer our products successfully. Any of the foregoing could cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from selling our products.\nWe depend on a small team of senior management and may have difficulty attracting and retaining additional personnel.\nOur future success will depend in large part upon the continued services and performance of senior management and other key personnel. If we lose the services of any member of our senior management team, our overall operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, our future success will depend on our ability to identify, attract, hire, train, retain and motivate other highly skilled technical, managerial, marketing, purchasing and customer service personnel when they are needed. Competition for these individuals is intense. We cannot ensure that we will be able to successfully attract, integrate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel when the need arises. Any failure to attract and retain the necessary technical, managerial, marketing, purchasing and customer service personnel could have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be affected if the United States participates in wars or other military action or by international terrorism.\nInvolvement in a war or other military action or acts of terrorism may cause significant disruption to commerce throughout the world. To the extent that such disruptions result in (i) delays or cancellations of customer orders, (ii) a general decrease in consumer spending on information technology, (iii) our inability to effectively market and distribute our services or products or (iv) our inability to access capital markets, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We are unable to predict whether the involvement in a war or other military action will result in any long-term commercial disruptions or if such involvement or responses will have any long-term material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nCyber security risks and cyber incidents could adversely affect our business and disrupt operations.\nCyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. These incidents can include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. The result of these incidents could include, but are not limited to, disrupted operations, misstated financial data, liability for stolen assets or information, increased cyber-security protection costs, litigation and reputational damage adversely affecting customer or investor confidence. We have implemented systems and processes to focus on identification, prevention, mitigation and resolution. However, these measures cannot provide absolute security, and our systems may be vulnerable to cyber-security breaches such as viruses, hacking, and similar disruptions from unauthorized intrusions. In addition, we rely on third party service providers to perform certain services, such as payroll and tax services. Any failure of our systems or third party systems may compromise our sensitive information and/or personally identifiable information of our employees. While we have secured cyber insurance to potentially cover certain risks associated with cyber incidents, there can be no assurance the insurance will be sufficient to cover any such liability.\nOur exposure to the credit risk of our customers and suppliers may adversely affect our financial results.\nWe sell our products to customers that have in the past, and may in the future, experience financial difficulties. If our customers experience financial difficulties, we could have difficulty recovering amounts owed to us from these customers. While we perform credit evaluations and adjust credit limits based upon each customer\u2019s payment history and credit worthiness, such programs may not be effective in reducing our exposure to credit risk. We evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable, and based on this evaluation make adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts for expected losses. Actual bad debt write-offs may differ from our estimates, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nOur suppliers may also experience financial difficulties, which could result in our having difficulty sourcing the materials and components we use in producing our products and providing our services. This risk is increased given we depend on a limited number of third party suppliers to provide the components and the equipment required to deliver our solutions, with purchases from one supplier comprising approximately 81% of total purchases for the year ended December 31, 2018. If we encounter such difficulties, we may not be able to produce our products for our customers in a timely fashion which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nChanges in the economy and credit markets may adversely affect our future results of operations.\nOur operations and performance depend to some degree on general economic conditions and their impact on our customers\u2019 finances and purchase decisions. As a result of economic events, potential customers may elect to defer purchases of capital equipment items, such as the products we manufacture and supply. Additionally, the credit markets and the financial services industry are subject to change. While the ultimate outcome of these events cannot be predicted, it may have a material adverse effect on our customers\u2019 ability to fund their operations thus adversely impacting their ability to purchase our products or to pay for our products on a timely basis, if at all. These and other economic factors could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products, the collection of payments for our products and on our financial condition and operating results.\nWe may not be able to obtain payment and performance bonds, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur ability to deploy our EcoSmart Suite of products into the energy management initiatives in federally funded or assisted projects may rely on our ability to obtain payment and performance bonds which may be an essential element to work orders for the installation of our products and services. If we are unable to obtain payment and performance bonds in a timely fashion as required by an applicable work order, we may not be entitled to payment under the work order until such bonds have been provided or until such a requirement is expressly waived. In addition, any delays due to a failure to furnish bonds may not entitle us to a price increase for the work or an extension of time to complete the work and may entitle the other party to terminate our work order without liability and to indemnify such party from damages suffered as a result of our failure to deliver the bonds and the termination of the work order. As a result, the failure to obtain bonds where required could negatively impact our business, results of operations, and prospects.", "PERMNO": 90054, "SIC": 3823, "TIC": "TKOI"}
