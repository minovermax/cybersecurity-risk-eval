{"cik": "81318", "company": "Yuma Energy, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nWe are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. The following summarizes significant risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. When considering an investment in our securities, you should carefully consider the risk factors included below as well as those matters referenced in the foregoing pages under \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and other information included and incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDue to low current commodity prices, we anticipate that we may be required to take write-downs of the carrying values of our properties in 2016.\nAccounting rules require that we periodically review the carrying value of our properties for possible impairment. Based on specific market factors and circumstances at the time of prospective impairment reviews, and the continuing evaluation of development plans, production data, economics and other factors, we may be required to write down the carrying value of our properties. A write-down constitutes a non-cash charge to earnings. Based upon commodity prices as of March 31, 2016, we do not expect that we will incur an impairment charge in the first quarter of 2016, but we may incur impairments in future periods.\nOur short-term liquidity is significantly constrained, and could severely impact our cash flow and our development of our properties.\nCurrently, our principal sources of liquidity are cash flow from our operations and borrowing under our credit facility. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we borrowed $6.9 million under our credit facility to fund a portion of our capital expenditures. On December 30, 2015, we entered into the Waiver, Borrowing Base Redetermination and Ninth Amendment to our credit agreement (the \u201cAmendment\u201d), which reduced our borrowing base to $29.8 million and automatically reduces our borrowing base to $20.0 million on May 31, 2016. As of March 29, 2016, our total borrowing base was $29.8 million with no remaining availability. This reduction severely limits our liquidity and limits our expenditures to our current cash flow. Furthermore, the Amendment automatically reduces our borrowing base by $9.8 million to $20.0 million on May 31, 2016. Accordingly, we will be in default under our credit agreement if we do not repay $9.8 million by May 31, 2016 or obtain an extension from our lenders. As a condition to the merger with Davis, we will need to enter into an amendment to our credit agreement to take into account the properties of Davis, which we anticipate will help our liquidity; however, we do not anticipate closing our merger with Davis until the middle of 2016 and will need to obtain a waiver from our lenders, which they may not provide. Additionally, the merger with Davis is subject to approval by our shareholders, including at least two-thirds of the shares of our Series A Preferred Stock. At this time, we have little capital to develop our properties.\nOur audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 contain a going-concern qualification, raising questions as to our continued existence.\nOur independent auditors have issued a going concern opinion, which means that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. As of the date of this report, we will require additional funds for the balance of fiscal year 2016 to repay $9.8 million under our credit agreement when our borrowing base is reduced to $20.0 million on May 31, 2016 and to continue our operations. If we cannot raise these funds or complete the merger with Davis, we may be required to significantly alter our business plan, reduce our activities, sell assets, or we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the possible inability to continue as a going concern.\nOur credit facility has substantial restrictions and financial covenants and our ability to comply with those restrictions and covenants is uncertain. Our lenders can unilaterally reduce our borrowing availability based on anticipated commodity prices.\nThe terms of our credit agreement require us to comply with certain financial covenants and ratios. Our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants in the future is uncertain and will be affected by the levels of cash flows from operations and events or circumstances beyond our control. Our failure to comply with any of the restrictions and covenants under the credit facility or other debt agreements could result in a default under those agreements, which could cause all of our existing indebtedness to be immediately due and payable.\nThe credit facility limits the amounts we can borrow to a borrowing base amount, determined by the lenders in their sole discretion based upon projected revenues from the properties securing their loan. For example, our lenders have reduced our borrowing base from $29.8 million to $20.0 effective May 31, 2016. Significant recent decreases in the price of crude oil are likely to have an adverse effect on our borrowing base. The lenders can unilaterally adjust the borrowing base and the borrowings permitted to be outstanding under the credit facility. Outstanding borrowings in excess of the borrowing base must be repaid immediately, or we must pledge other crude oil and natural gas properties as additional collateral. We do not currently have any substantial unpledged properties, and we may not have the financial resources in the future to make any mandatory principal prepayments required under the credit facility. We anticipate that our merger with Davis will add substantial properties that may be pledged under our credit agreement; however, if the Davis merger is not approved by our shareholders, including at least two-thirds of the shares of our Series A Preferred Stock, we will not be able to complete the merger with Davis. Our inability to borrow additional funds under our credit facility could adversely affect our operations and our financial results, and possibly force us into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nIf we are unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness, there would be a default under the terms of these agreements, which could result in an acceleration of payment of funds that we have borrowed and would impact our ability to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness and satisfy our other obligations.\nAny default under the agreements governing our indebtedness, including a default under our credit facility that is not waived by the required lenders, and the remedies sought by the holders of any such indebtedness, could make us unable to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness and satisfy our other obligations. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows and are otherwise unable to obtain the funds necessary to meet required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants, including financial and operating covenants, in the instruments governing our indebtedness, we could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness. In the event of such default, the holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, the lenders under our credit facility could elect to terminate their commitments, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If our operating performance declines, we may in the future need to seek to obtain waivers from the required lenders under our credit facility to avoid being in default and we may not be able to obtain such a waiver. If this occurs, we would be in default under our credit facility, the lenders could exercise their rights as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. We cannot assure you that we will be granted waivers or amendments to our debt agreements if for any reason we are unable to comply with these agreements, or that we will be able to refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under our credit facility bear interest at variable rates and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase although the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash available for servicing our indebtedness and for other purposes would decrease.\nOil and natural gas prices are volatile. A substantial or extended decline in commodity prices will likely adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our debt commitments, or capital expenditure obligations and other financial commitments.\nPrices for oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids can fluctuate widely. For example, the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate oil prices have been volatile and ranged from a high of $107.26 per barrel in June 2014 to a low of $26.21 per barrel in February 2016. Also, NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas prices have been volatile and ranged from a high of $6.15 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in February 2014 to a low of $1.64 per MMBtu in December 2015. Our revenues, profitability and our future growth and the carrying value of our properties depend substantially on prevailing oil and natural gas prices. Prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital. The amount we will be able to borrow under our credit agreement is subject to periodic redetermination based in part on current oil and natural gas prices and on changing expectations of future prices. Lower prices may also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can economically produce and have an adverse effect on the value of our properties.\nHistorically, the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile, and they are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. Among the factors that can cause volatility are:\n\u25cf\nthe domestic and foreign supply of, and demand for, oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf\nvolatility and trading patterns in the commodity-futures markets;\n\u25cf\nthe ability of members of OPEC and other producing countries to agree upon and determine oil prices and production levels;\n\u25cf\nsocial unrest and political instability, particularly in major oil and natural gas producing regions outside the United States, such as Africa and the Middle East, and armed conflict or terrorist attacks, whether or not in oil or natural gas producing regions;\n\u25cf\nthe level of consumer product demand;\n\u25cf\nthe growth of consumer product demand in emerging markets, such as China;\n\u25cf\nlabor unrest in oil and natural gas producing regions;\n\u25cf\nweather conditions, including hurricanes and other natural occurrences that affect the supply and/or demand of oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels;\n\u25cf\nthe price of foreign imports;\n\u25cf\nworldwide economic conditions; and\n\u25cf\nthe availability of liquid natural gas imports.\nThese external factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it difficult to estimate future prices of oil and natural gas.\nThe long-term effect of these and other factors on the prices of oil and natural gas is uncertain. Prolonged or further declines in these commodity prices may have the following effects on our business:\n\u25cf\nadversely affecting our financial condition, liquidity, ability to finance planned capital expenditures, and results of operations;\n\u25cf\nreducing the amount of oil and, natural gas that we can produce economically;\n\u25cf\ncausing us to delay or postpone a significant portion of our capital projects;\n\u25cf\nmaterially reducing our revenues, operating income, or cash flows;\n\u25cf\nreducing the amounts of our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u25cf\nreducing the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties due to recognizing additional impairments of proved properties, unproved properties and exploration assets;\n\u25cf\nreducing the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to oil and natural gas reserves; and\n\u25cf\nlimiting our access to, or increasing the cost of, sources of capital such as equity and long-term debt.\nOur operations and future development activities are concentrated in the Greater Masters Creek Field in west central Louisiana. In the event the field does not meet our expectations with respect to drilling and future production or we are unable to develop the field due to capital constraints, our future business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected.\nAs set forth elsewhere in this report, our Greater Masters Creek Field in west central Louisiana is our largest oil and natural gas development project. At December 31, 2015, we held approximately 61,986 net acres in the field. Although the acreage has been partially developed by prior operators, our internal geological and engineering evaluation, as substantiated by two independent third-party engineering firms, supports the presence of significant remaining proved and non-proved undeveloped reserves and additional potential. Our independent petroleum engineering reserve report as of December 31, 2015 includes 22 operated proved undeveloped well locations and three non-operated proved undeveloped well locations, 63 operated non-proved undeveloped locations, and 11 non-operated non-proved undeveloped locations that are held by production or contain existing leasehold.\nIn December of 2014, we completed our second operated Austin Chalk well, the Crosby 14-1. While this well encountered bottom-hole pressure consistent with our third-party engineering estimates and demonstrated encouraging initial production results, we encountered significant mechanical difficulties while drilling and completing the well that eventually led to problems producing the well. Due to restrictions in the horizontal section of the well bore, including down-hole drilling motor components, we were not able to run a slotted liner which is used to prevent, among other things, formation and drilling debris from entering the wellbore during production operations. Subsequent attempts to maintain sustained and economic production from the well failed because formation and drilling debris continued to plug the well. The well last produced in April 2015 and was subsequently shut-in.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the field contained approximately 84.1% of our total proved undeveloped reserves and 83.7% of the PV-10 of such reserves. Additionally, the field\u2019s proved undeveloped reserves represent approximately 61.7% of our total proved reserves. Because such a significant portion of our operations are concentrated in the field, the success of our operations and our profitability may be disproportionately exposed to the effect of various events with respect to the field, including but not limited to unanticipated costs and delays in drilling, fluctuations in prices of natural gas and oil produced from wells, natural disasters, restrictive governmental regulations, transportation capacity constraints, inclement weather, curtailment of production due to unforeseen events, and any resulting delays or interruptions of production from existing or planned new wells in the field. We are currently seeking joint venture partners to participate in the future drilling and development of these locations, which would reduce our participating interest in these locations and thereby reduce our future capital expenditures and associated proved and non-proved reserves and production. We plan to drill one proved undeveloped well this year and the remaining proved undeveloped wells within five years from the date they were originally recorded. However, in the event our assumptions and analyses regarding the field are incorrect to any significant degree, the future production from the wells to be drilled may be adversely affected, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our development plan as of January 1, 2016 assumes that the net capital for development of the field will be approximately $105 million over four years. Our ability to have sufficient capital in accordance with our plan to complete the development of these undeveloped reserves will be subject to our future cash flows, future prices for oil and gas, our ability to bring in other partners, as well as our capital raising abilities. Any significant sustained decrease in the price of oil and gas or our ability to obtain financing, either debt or equity, or attract joint venture partners would have a significant negative impact on our ability to develop the field as planned and hence, realize the positive cash flow and net income as estimated elsewhere in this report.\nWe may not be able to drill wells on a substantial portion of our acreage.\nWe may not be able to drill on a substantial portion of our acreage for various reasons. We may not generate or be able to raise sufficient capital to do so. Further deterioration in commodities prices may also make drilling certain acreage uneconomic. Our actual drilling activities and future drilling budget will depend on drilling results, oil and natural gas prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, lease expirations, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints, regulatory approvals and other factors. In addition, any drilling activities we are able to conduct may not be successful or add additional proved reserves to our overall proved reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our net leasehold acreage is undeveloped, and that acreage may not ultimately be developed or become commercially productive, which could cause us to lose rights under our leases as well as have a material adverse effect on our oil and natural gas reserves and future production and, therefore, our future cash flow and income.\nA significant portion of our net leasehold acreage is undeveloped, or acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and natural gas regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves. In addition, many of our oil and natural gas leases require us to drill wells that are commercially productive, and if we are unsuccessful in drilling such wells, we could lose our rights under such leases. Our future oil and natural gas reserves and production and, therefore, our future cash flow and income, are dependent on successfully developing our undeveloped leasehold acreage.\nOur undeveloped acreage must be drilled before lease expirations to hold the acreage by production. Failure to drill sufficient wells to hold acreage could result in a substantial lease renewal cost or, if renewal is not feasible, loss of our undeveloped leases and prospective drilling opportunities.\nUnless production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres on which some of the locations are identified, the leases for such acreage will expire. Approximately 79% of our total Masters Creek undeveloped acreage will be subject to expiration in 2016, with 20% of such acreage expiring in 2017, and 1% in 2018. As of December 31, 2015, leases representing 76%, 23%, and 1%, respectively, of our total undeveloped acreage are scheduled to expire in 2016, 2017, and 2018. The cost to renew expiring leases may increase significantly, and we may not be able to renew such leases on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to fund renewals of expiring leases, we could lose portions of our acreage and our actual drilling activities may differ materially from our current expectations, which could adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to sell our production and/or receive market prices for our production may be adversely affected by transportation capacity constraints and interruptions.\nIf the amount of natural gas, condensate or oil being produced by us and others exceeds the capacity of the various transportation pipelines and gathering systems available in our operating areas, it will be necessary for new transportation pipelines and gathering systems to be built. Or, in the case of oil and condensate, it will be necessary for us to rely more heavily on trucks to transport our production, which is more expensive and less efficient than transportation via pipeline. The construction of new pipelines and gathering systems is capital intensive and construction may be postponed, interrupted or cancelled in response to changing economic conditions and the availability and cost of capital. In addition, capital constraints could limit our ability to build gathering systems to transport our production to transportation pipelines. In such event, costs to transport our production may increase materially or we might have to shut in our wells awaiting a pipeline connection or capacity and/or sell our production at much lower prices than market or than we currently project, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nA portion of our production may also be interrupted, or shut in, from time to time for numerous other reasons, including as a result of operational issues, mechanical breakdowns, weather conditions, accidents, loss of pipeline or gathering system access, field labor issues or strikes, or we might voluntarily curtail production in response to market conditions. If a substantial amount of our production is interrupted at the same time, it could adversely affect our cash flow.\nUnless we replace our reserves, our reserves and production will decline, which would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nProducing oil and natural gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Decline rates are typically greatest early in the productive life of a well. Estimates of the decline rate of an oil or natural gas well are inherently imprecise, and are less precise with respect to new or emerging oil and natural gas formations with limited production histories than for more developed formations with established production histories. Our production levels and the reserves that we currently expect to recover from our wells will change if production from our existing wells declines in a different manner than we have estimated and can change under other circumstances. Thus, our future oil and natural gas reserves and production and, therefore, our cash flow and results of operations are highly dependent upon our success in efficiently developing and exploiting our current properties and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. We may not be able to develop, find or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs. If we are unable to replace our current and future production, our cash flow and the value of our reserves may decrease, adversely affecting our business, financial condition, results of operations, and potentially the borrowing capacity under our credit facility.\nEstimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves involve assumptions and any material inaccuracies in these assumptions will materially affect the quantities and the net present value of our reserves.\nThis report contains estimates of our proved oil and natural gas reserves. These estimates are based upon various assumptions, including assumptions required by the SEC relating to oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex. This process requires significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. Therefore, these estimates are inherently imprecise.\nActual future production, oil and natural gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves will vary from those estimated. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and the net present value of our reserves. For instance, the SEC mandated prices used in estimating our proved reserves are $50.28 per Bbl of oil and $2.59 per MMBtu of natural gas, which are significantly higher than current spot market prices. Our properties may also be susceptible to hydrocarbon drainage from production by other operators on adjacent properties. In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nAt December 31, 2015, approximately 73.3% of our estimated reserves were classified as proved undeveloped. Recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations. The reserve data assumes that we will make significant capital expenditures to develop our reserves. The estimates of these oil and natural gas reserves and the costs associated with development of these reserves have been prepared in accordance with SEC regulations; however, actual capital expenditures will likely vary from estimated capital expenditures, development may not occur as scheduled and actual results may not be as estimated.\nThe standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves will not be the same as the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves.\nYou should not assume that the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements in effect at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we based the discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the 12-month first-day-of-the-month oil and natural gas average prices without giving effect to derivative transactions. Actual future net cash flows from our oil and natural gas properties will be affected by factors such as:\n\u25cf\nactual prices we receive for oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf\nactual cost of development and production expenditures;\n\u25cf\nthe amount and timing of actual production; and\n\u25cf\nchanges in governmental regulations or taxation.\nThe timing of both our production and our incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing and amount of actual future net revenues from proved reserves, and thus their actual present value. In addition, the 10% discount factor we use when calculating standardized measure may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and natural gas industry in general. As a corporation, we are treated as a taxable entity for federal income tax purposes and our future income taxes will be dependent on our future taxable income. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the present value estimates included in this report which could have a material effect on the value of our reserves.\nWe depend on computer and telecommunications systems and failures in our systems or cyber security attacks could significantly disrupt our business operations.\nWe have entered into agreements with third parties for hardware, software, telecommunications and other information technology services in connection with our business. It is possible we could incur interruptions from cyber security attacks, computer viruses or malware. We believe that we have positive relations with our related vendors and maintain adequate anti-virus and malware software and controls; however, any interruptions to our arrangements with third parties to our computing and communications infrastructure or our information systems could significantly disrupt our business operations.\nWe depend substantially on our key personnel for critical management decisions and industry contacts.\nOur success depends upon the continued contributions of our executive officers and key employees, particularly with respect to providing the critical management decisions and contacts necessary to manage and maintain our company within a highly competitive industry. Competition for qualified personnel can be intense, particularly in the oil and natural gas industry, and there are a limited number of people with the requisite knowledge and experience. Under these conditions, we could be unable to attract and retain these personnel. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur business is highly competitive.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive in many respects, including identification of attractive oil and natural gas properties for acquisition, drilling and development, securing financing for such activities and obtaining the necessary equipment and personnel to conduct such operations and activities. In seeking suitable opportunities, we compete with a number of other companies, including large oil and natural gas companies and other independent operators with greater financial resources, larger numbers of personnel and facilities, and, in some cases, with more expertise. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively with these entities.\nOur oil and natural gas activities are subject to various risks which are beyond our control.\nOur operations are subject to many risks and hazards incident to exploring and drilling for, producing, transporting, marketing and selling oil and natural gas. Although we may take precautionary measures, many of these risks and hazards are beyond our control and unavoidable under the circumstances. Many of these risks or hazards could materially and adversely affect our revenues and expenses, the ability of certain of our wells to produce oil and natural gas in commercial and economic quantities, the rate of production and the economics of the development of, and our investment in the prospects in which we have or will acquire an interest. Any of these risks and hazards could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Such risks and hazards include:\n\u25cf\nhuman error, accidents, labor force and other factors beyond our control that may cause personal injuries or death to persons and destruction or damage to equipment and facilities;\n\u25cf\nblowouts, fires, hurricanes, pollution and equipment failures that may result in damage to or destruction of wells, producing formations, production facilities and equipment and increased drilling and production costs;\n\u25cf\nunavailability of materials and equipment;\n\u25cf\nengineering and construction delays;\n\u25cf\nunanticipated transportation costs and delays;\n\u25cf\nunfavorable weather conditions;\n\u25cf\nhazards resulting from unusual or unexpected geological or environmental conditions;\n\u25cf\nenvironmental regulations and requirements;\n\u25cf\naccidental leakage of toxic or hazardous materials, such as petroleum liquids, drilling fluids or salt water, into the environment;\n\u25cf\nhazards resulting from the presence of hydrogen sulfide or other contaminants in natural gas we produce;\n\u25cf\nchanges in laws and regulations, including laws and regulations applicable to oil and natural gas activities or markets for the oil and natural gas produced;\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in supply and demand for oil and natural gas causing variations of the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production; and\n\u25cf\nthe availability of alternative fuels and the price at which they become available.\nAs a result of these risks, expenditures, quantities and rates of production, revenues and operating costs may be materially affected and may differ materially from those anticipated by us.\nOur exploration and development drilling efforts and the operation of our wells may not be profitable or achieve our targeted returns.\nWe require significant amounts of undeveloped leasehold acreage to further our development efforts. Exploration, development, drilling and production activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that commercially productive reservoirs will not be discovered. We invest in property, including undeveloped leasehold acreage that we believe will result in projects that will add value over time. However, we cannot guarantee that our leasehold acreage will be profitably developed, that new wells drilled by us will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment in such leasehold acreage or wells. Drilling for oil and natural gas may involve unprofitable efforts, not only from dry wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net reserves to return a profit after deducting operating and other costs. In addition, wells that are profitable may not achieve our targeted rate of return. Our ability to achieve our target results is dependent upon the current and future market prices for oil and natural gas, costs associated with producing oil and natural gas and our ability to add reserves at an acceptable cost.\nIn addition, we may not be successful in controlling our drilling and production costs to improve our overall return. The cost of drilling, completing and operating a well is often uncertain and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a project. We cannot predict the cost of drilling and completing a well, and we may be forced to limit, delay or cancel drilling operations as a result of a variety of factors, including:\n\u25cf\nunexpected drilling conditions;\n\u25cf\ndownhole and well completion difficulties;\n\u25cf\npressure or irregularities in formations;\n\u25cf\nequipment failures or breakdowns, or accidents and shortages or delays in the availability of drilling and completion equipment and services;\n\u25cf\nfires, explosions, blowouts and surface cratering;\n\u25cf\nadverse weather conditions, including hurricanes; and\n\u25cf\ncompliance with governmental requirements.\nWe are subject to complex federal, state, local and other laws and regulations that from time to time are amended to impose more stringent requirements that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.\nCompanies that explore for and develop, produce, sell and transport oil and natural gas in the United States are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations, including complex tax and environmental, health and safety laws and the corresponding regulations, and are required to obtain various permits and approvals from federal, state and local agencies. If these permits are not issued or unfavorable restrictions or conditions are imposed on our drilling activities, we may not be able to conduct our operations as planned. We may be required to make large expenditures to comply with governmental regulations. Matters subject to regulation include:\n\u25cf\nwater discharge and disposal permits for drilling operations;\n\u25cf\ndrilling bonds;\n\u25cf\ndrilling permits;\n\u25cf\nreports concerning operations;\n\u25cf\nair quality, air emissions, noise levels and related permits;\n\u25cf\nspacing of wells;\n\u25cf\nrights-of-way and easements;\n\u25cf\nunitization and pooling of properties;\n\u25cf\npipeline construction;\n\u25cf\ngathering, transportation and marketing of oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf\ntaxation; and\n\u25cf\nwaste transport and disposal permits and requirements.\nFailure to comply with applicable laws may result in the suspension or termination of operations and subject us to liabilities, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties. Compliance costs can be significant. Moreover, the laws governing our operations or the enforcement thereof could change in ways that substantially increase the costs of doing business. Any such liabilities, penalties, suspensions, terminations or regulatory changes could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Under environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we also could be held liable for personal injuries, property damage (including site clean-up and restoration costs) and other damages including the assessment of natural resource damages. Such laws may impose strict as well as joint and several liability for environmental contamination, which could subject us to liability for the conduct of others or for our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time such actions were taken. Environmental and other governmental laws and regulations also increase the costs to plan, design, drill, install, operate and abandon oil and natural gas wells. Moreover, public interest in environmental protection has increased in recent years, and environmental organizations have opposed, with some success, certain drilling projects. Part of the regulatory environment in which we operate includes, in some cases, federal requirements for performing or preparing environmental assessments, environmental impact studies and/or plans of development before commencing exploration and production activities. In addition, our activities are subject to regulation by oil and natural gas-producing states relating to conservation practices and protection of correlative rights. These regulations affect our operations and limit the quantity of oil and natural gas we may produce and sell. Delays in obtaining regulatory approvals or necessary permits, the failure to obtain a permit or the receipt of a permit with excessive conditions or costs could have a material adverse effect on our ability to explore on, develop or produce our properties. Additionally, the oil and natural gas regulatory environment could change in ways that might substantially increase the financial and managerial costs to comply with the requirements of these laws and regulations and, consequently, adversely affect our profitability.\nFederal, state and local legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.\nFederal, state, tribal and local governments have been adopting or considering restrictions on or prohibitions of fracturing in areas where we have operated and non-operated working interests and the operator of such properties could be subject to additional levels of regulation, operational delays or increased operating costs and could have regulatory burdens imposed upon it that could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and increase the costs of compliance and doing business.\nFrom time to time, for example, legislation has been proposed in Congress to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act (\u201cSDWA\u201d) to require federal permitting of hydraulic fracturing and the disclosure of chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. Further, the EPA is conducting a wide-ranging study on the effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. In December 2015, the EPA issued a draft final report for public comment and peer review. Other governmental reviews have also been recently conducted or are under way that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing. For example, a BLM rulemaking for hydraulic fracturing practices on federal and Indian lands resulted in a 2015 final rule that requires public disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands, confirmation that the wells used in fracturing operations meet proper construction standards and development of plans for managing related flowback water. These activities could result in additional regulatory scrutiny that could make it difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business with regard to our operated and non-operated properties.\nCertain states likewise have adopted, and other states are considering the adoption of regulations that impose new or more stringent requirements for various aspects of hydraulic fracturing operations, such as permitting, disclosure, air emissions, well construction, seismic monitoring, waste disposal and water use. In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict or prohibit drilling in general or hydraulic fracturing in particular. Such efforts have extended to bans on hydraulic fracturing.\nAs a working interest owner, we use a significant amount of water with respect to hydraulic fracturing operations. The inability to locate sufficient amounts of water, or dispose of or recycle water used in exploration and production operations, could adversely impact our operations. Moreover, new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to participate in certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of waste, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of oil and natural gas. Compliance with environmental regulations and regulatory permit requirements governing the withdrawal, storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells may increase the operating costs of our properties and cause delays, interruptions or termination of operations, all of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Further, if the use of hydraulic fracturing is limited, prohibited or subjected to further regulation, these requirements could delay or effectively prevent the extraction of oil and natural gas from formations which would not be economically viable without the use of hydraulic fracturing.\nHydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and various chemicals under pressure into geologic formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. This process may give rise to operational issues such as an underground migration of water and chemicals to unintended areas, wellbore integrity, possible surface spillage and contamination caused by mishandling of fracturing fluids, including chemical additives. Properly administering the hydraulic fracturing process entails operational costs and a failure to properly administer the process could cause significant remedial and financial costs.\nRegulation related to global warming and climate change could have an adverse effect on our operations and demand for oil and natural gas.\nStudies over recent years have indicated that emissions of certain gases may be contributing to warming of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. In response to these studies, governments have been adopting domestic and international climate change regulations that require reporting and reductions of the emission of such greenhouse gases. Methane, a primary component of natural gas, and carbon dioxide, a byproduct of burning oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products, are considered greenhouse gases. Internationally, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement address greenhouse gas emissions, and international negotiations over climate change and greenhouse gases are continuing. Meanwhile, several countries, including those comprising the European Union, have established greenhouse gas regulatory systems.\nIn the United States, many states, either individually or through multi-state regional initiatives, have begun implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily through emission inventories, emission targets, greenhouse gas cap and trade programs or incentives for renewable energy generation, while others have considered adopting such greenhouse gas programs.\nAt the federal level, the Obama Administration is attempting to address climate change through a variety of administrative actions. The EPA has issued greenhouse gas monitoring and reporting regulations that cover oil and natural gas facilities, among other industries. On July 19, 2011, the EPA amended the oil and natural gas facility greenhouse gas reporting rule to require reporting beginning in September 2012. Beyond measuring and reporting, the EPA issued an \u201cEndangerment Finding\u201d under section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act, concluding certain greenhouse gas pollution threatens the public health and welfare of current and future generations. The finding served as the first step to issuing regulations that require permits for and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for certain facilities. In March 2014, moreover, the President released a Strategy to Reduce Methane Emissions that included consideration of both voluntary programs and targeted regulations for the oil and gas sector. Towards that end, the EPA released five draft white papers on methane and volatile organic compound emissions and mitigation measures for natural gas compressors, hydraulically fractured oil wells, pneumatic devices, well liquids unloading facilities and natural gas production and transmission facilities. Building on its white papers and the public input on those documents, the EPA issued a proposed rule in 2015 that would set additional standards for methane and emissions from oil and gas production sources, including hydraulically fractured oil wells and natural gas processing and transmission sources. The EPA intends to issue a final rule in 2016. In addition, the BLM has proposed standards for reducing venting and flaring on public lands. The EPA and BLM actions are part of a series of steps by the Administration that are intended to result by 2025 in a 40-45% decrease in methane emissions from the oil and gas industry as compared to 2012 levels.\nIn the courts, several decisions have been issued that may increase the risk of claims being filed by governments and private parties against companies that have significant greenhouse gas emissions. Such cases may seek to challenge air emissions permits that greenhouse gas emitters apply for and seek to force emitters to reduce their emissions or seek damages for alleged climate change impacts to the environment, people, and property.\nAny laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to incur additional operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions controls to obtain emission allowances or to pay emission taxes, and reduce demand for our products.\nThe ongoing implementation of federal legislation enacted in 2010 could have an adverse impact on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effects of commodity prices, interest rates and other risks associated with our business.\nHistorically, we have entered into a number of commodity derivative contracts in order to hedge a portion of our oil and natural gas production. On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, which requires the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the \u201cCFTC\u201d), along with other federal agencies, to promulgate regulations implementing the new legislation. The CFTC, in coordination with the SEC and various U.S. federal banking regulators, has issued regulations to implement the so-called \u201cVolcker Rule\u201d under which banking entities are generally prohibited from proprietary trading of derivatives. Although conditional exemptions from this general prohibition are available, the Volcker Rule may limit the trading activities of banking entities that have been counterparties to our derivatives trades in the past.\nThe CFTC also has finalized other regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s provisions regarding trade reporting, margin and position limits; however, some regulations remain to be finalized and it is not possible at this time to predict when the CFTC will adopt final rules. For example, the CFTC has re-proposed regulations setting position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic equivalents. Certain bona fide hedging transactions are expected to be made exempt from these limits. Also, it is possible that under recently adopted margin rules, some CFTC registered swap dealers may require us to post initial and variation margins in connection with certain swaps not subject to central clearing.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act and any additional implementing regulations could significantly increase the cost of some commodity derivative contracts (including through requirements to post collateral, which could adversely affect our available liquidity), materially alter the terms of some commodity derivative contracts, limit our ability to trade some derivatives to hedge risks, reduce the availability of some derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, and reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing commodity derivative contracts. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a consequence, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. Increased volatility may make us less attractive to certain types of investors. Finally, the Dodd-Frank Act was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas. If the implementing regulations result in lower commodity prices, our revenues could be adversely affected. Any of these consequences could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to crude oil and natural gas and exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation.\nThe Obama administration has proposed to eliminate certain key U.S. federal income tax preferences currently available with respect to crude oil and natural gas exploration and production. The proposals include, but are not limited to (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion deduction for crude oil and natural gas properties; (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs; (iii) the elimination of the deduction for certain U.S. production activities; and (iv) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. In addition, President Obama has recently proposed a $10.25 per barrel tax on oil companies. It is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address these proposals would impact our business, but any such future laws and regulations could result in higher federal income taxes, which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, proposals are made from time to time in states where we operate to implement or increase severance or other taxes at the state level, and any such additional taxes would have similarly adverse effects on us.\nWe participate in oil and natural gas leases with third parties who may not be able to fulfill their commitments to our projects.\nWe frequently own less than 100% of the working interest in the oil and natural gas leases on which we conduct operations, and other parties own the remaining portion of the working interest. Financial risks are inherent in any operation where the cost of drilling, equipping, completing and operating wells is shared by more than one person. We could be held liable for joint activity obligations of other working interest owners, such as nonpayment of costs and liabilities arising from the actions of other working interest owners. In addition, declines in oil and natural gas prices may increase the likelihood that some of these working interest owners, particularly those that are smaller and less established, are not able to fulfill their joint activity obligations. A partner may be unable or unwilling to pay its share of project costs, and, in some cases, a partner may declare bankruptcy. In the event any of our project partners do not pay their share of such costs, we would likely have to pay those costs, and we may be unsuccessful in any efforts to recover these costs from our partners, which could materially adversely affect our financial position.\nWe cannot be certain that the insurance coverage maintained by us will be adequate to cover all losses that may be sustained in connection with all oil and natural gas activities.\nWe maintain general and excess liability policies, which we consider to be reasonable and consistent with industry standards. These policies generally cover:\n\u25cf\npersonal injury;\n\u25cf\nbodily injury;\n\u25cf\nthird party property damage;\n\u25cf\nmedical expenses;\n\u25cf\nlegal defense costs;\n\u25cf\npollution in some cases;\n\u25cf\nwell blowouts in some cases; and\n\u25cf\nworkers compensation.\nAs is common in the oil and natural gas industry, we will not insure fully against all risks associated with our business either because such insurance is not available or because we believe the premium costs are prohibitive. A loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. There can be no assurance that the insurance coverage that we maintain will be sufficient to cover claims made against us in the future.\nTitle to the properties in which we have an interest may be impaired by title defects.\nWe generally obtain title opinions on significant properties that we drill or acquire. However, there is no assurance that we will not suffer a monetary loss from title defects or title failure. Additionally, undeveloped acreage has greater risk of title defects than developed acreage. Generally, under the terms of the operating agreements affecting our properties, any monetary loss is to be borne by all parties to any such agreement in proportion to their interests in such property. If there are any title defects or defects in assignment of leasehold rights in properties in which we hold an interest, we will suffer a financial loss.\nThe unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, pressure pumping equipment and crews, other equipment, supplies, water, personnel and oil field services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is cyclical and, from time to time, there have been shortages of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, water or qualified personnel. During these periods, the costs and delivery times of rigs, equipment and supplies are substantially greater. In addition, the demand for, and wage rates of, qualified drilling rig crews rise as the number of active rigs in service increases. Increasing levels of exploration and production may increase the demand for oilfield services and equipment, and the costs of these services and equipment may increase, while the quality of these services and equipment may suffer. The unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, pressure pumping equipment, supplies or qualified personnel can materially and adversely affect our operations and profitability.\nWe depend on the skill, ability and decisions of third-party operators of the oil and natural gas properties in which we have a non-operated working interest.\nThe success of the drilling, development and production of the oil and natural gas properties in which we have or expect to have a non-operating working interest is substantially dependent upon the decisions of such third-party operators and their diligence to comply with various laws, rules and regulations affecting such properties. The failure of third-party operators to make decisions, perform their services, discharge their obligations, deal with regulatory agencies, and comply with laws, rules and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations in a proper manner with respect to properties in which we have an interest could result in material adverse consequences to our interest in such properties, including substantial penalties and compliance costs. Such adverse consequences could result in substantial liabilities to us or reduce the value of our properties, which could materially affect our results of operations.\nHedging transactions may limit our potential gains and increase our potential losses.\nIn order to manage our exposure to price risks in the marketing of our oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids production, we have entered into oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids price hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our anticipated production and we may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future. While intended to reduce the effects of volatile commodity prices, such transactions may limit our potential gains and increase our potential losses if commodity prices were to rise substantially over the price established by the hedge. In addition, such transactions may expose us to the risk of loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which:\n\u25cf\nour production is less than expected;\n\u25cf\nthere is a widening of price differentials between delivery points for our production; or\n\u25cf\nthe counterparties to our hedging agreements fail to perform under the contracts.\nA component of our growth may come through acquisitions, and our failure to identify or complete future acquisitions successfully could reduce our earnings and slow our growth.\nWe may be unable to identify properties for acquisition or to make acquisitions on terms that we consider economically acceptable. There is intense competition for acquisition opportunities in our industry. Competition for acquisitions may increase the cost of, or cause us to refrain from, completing acquisitions. The completion and pursuit of acquisitions may be dependent upon, among other things, our ability to obtain debt and equity financing and, in some cases, regulatory approvals. Our ability to grow through acquisitions will require us to continue to invest in operations and financial and management information systems and to attract, retain, motivate and effectively manage our employees.\nIn addition, we may be unable to successfully integrate any potential acquisitions into our existing operations. The inability to manage the integration of acquisitions, including our merger with Davis, effectively could reduce our focus on subsequent acquisitions and current operations, and could negatively impact our results of operations and growth potential. Members of our management team may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to the integration process, including with respect to the merger of Davis, which will decrease the time they will have to manage our business.\nFurthermore, our decision to acquire properties that are substantially different in operating or geologic characteristics or geographic locations from areas with which our staff is familiar may impact our productivity in such areas. Our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may fluctuate significantly from period to period as a result of the completion of significant acquisitions during particular periods.\nWe may engage in bidding and negotiation to complete successful acquisitions. We may be required to alter or increase substantially our capitalization to finance these acquisitions through the use of cash on hand, the issuance of debt or equity securities, the sale of production payments, the sale of non-strategic assets, the borrowing of funds or otherwise. Our credit agreement includes covenants limiting our ability to incur additional debt. If we were to proceed with one or more acquisitions involving the issuance of our common stock, our shareholders would suffer dilution of their interests.\nWe may be unsuccessful in combining Davis\u2019 business with our existing business.\nThe success of the proposed merger of Davis will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and synergies from combining our business and existing asset base with the business of Davis and the assets obtained in the merger of Davis. To realize these anticipated benefits, the businesses must be successfully integrated. If we are not able to achieve these objectives, or we are not able to achieve these objectives on a timely basis, the anticipated benefits of the merger of Davis may not be realized fully or at all. In addition, the actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, which could reduce the anticipated benefits of the merger of Davis. These integration difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Ownership of our Common Stock\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NYSE MKT rules and, as a result, qualify for, and rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. As a result, our shareholders do not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to such requirements.\nSam L. Banks, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, beneficially owns a majority of our common stock. As a result, we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NYSE MKT corporate governance standards. Under the NYSE MKT rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by another person or group of persons acting together is a controlled company and may elect not to comply with certain NYSE MKT corporate governance requirements, including the requirements that:\n\u25cf\na majority of our board of directors consist of independent directors;\n\u25cf\nwe have a nominating committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities; and\n\u25cf\nwe have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities.\nWe are currently utilizing, and intend to continue to utilize, the exemption relating to the nominating committee, and we may utilize this exemption for so long as we are a controlled company. Accordingly, our shareholders do not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE MKT.\nOur common stock price has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock is subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, including quarterly variations in operating results, announcements of drilling and rig activity, economic conditions in the natural gas and oil industry, general economic conditions or other events or factors that are beyond our control.\nIn addition, the stock market in general and the market for oil and natural gas exploration companies, in particular, have experienced large price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating results or asset values of those companies. These broad market and industry factors may seriously impact the market price and trading volume of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has been instituted against certain oil and natural gas exploration companies. If this type of litigation were instituted against us following a period of volatility in our common stock trading price, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, future cash flows and the results of operations.\nThe low trading volume of our common stock may adversely affect the price of our shares and their liquidity.\nAlthough our common stock is listed on the NYSE MKT exchange, our common stock has experienced low trading volume. Limited trading volume may subject our common stock to greater price volatility and may make it difficult for investors to sell shares at a price that is attractive to them.\nIf our common stock price declines, our common stock may be subject to delisting from the NYSE MKT.\nOur common stock is currently trading at a price of less than $1.00 per share. We currently meet the continued listing standards of NYSE MKT. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to comply with the minimum bid price and the other standards that we are required to meet in order to maintain a listing of our common stock on the NYSE MKT. Our failure to continue to meet these requirements may result in our common stock being delisted from the NYSE MKT. If our common stock is delisted, this would, among other things, substantially impair our ability to raise additional funds and could result in a loss of institutional investor interest and fewer development opportunities for us.\nIf our common stock were delisted and determined to be a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d a broker-dealer may find it more difficult to trade our common stock, and an investor may find it more difficult to acquire or dispose of our common stock in the secondary market.\nIf our common stock were removed from listing with the NYSE MKT, it may be subject to the so-called \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules. The SEC has adopted regulations that define a penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price per share of less than $5.00, subject to certain exceptions, such as any securities listed on a national securities exchange. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers, subject to certain exceptions. If our common stock were delisted and determined to be a penny stock, a broker-dealer may find it more difficult to trade our common stock, and an investor may find it more difficult to acquire or dispose of our common stock on the secondary market.\nWe are able to issue shares of preferred stock with greater rights than our common stock.\nOur Restated Articles of Incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred shares and set the terms of the preferred shares without seeking any further approval from our shareholders. The preferred shares that we have issued rank ahead of our common stock in terms of dividends and liquidation rights. We may issue additional preferred shares that rank ahead of our common stock in terms of dividends, liquidation rights or voting rights. If we issue additional preferred shares in the future, it may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We have issued in the past, and may in the future continue to issue, in the open market at prevailing prices or in capital markets offerings series of perpetual preferred stock with dividend and liquidation preferences that rank ahead of our common stock.\nBecause we have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock, shareholders must look solely to appreciation of our common stock to realize a gain on their investment.\nWe do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the expansion of our business. In addition, our credit agreement contains covenants that prohibit us from paying cash dividends on our common stock as long as such debt remains outstanding. The payment of future dividends, if any, will be determined by our board of directors in light of conditions then existing, including our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, restrictions in financing agreements, business conditions and other factors. Accordingly, shareholders must look solely to appreciation of our common stock to realize a gain on their investment, which may not occur.\nRisks Related to the Ownership of our Series A Preferred Stock\nThe Series A Preferred Stock ranks junior to all of our indebtedness and other liabilities and is effectively junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries.\nIn the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our affairs, our assets will be available to pay obligations on the Series A Preferred Stock only after all of our indebtedness and other liabilities have been paid. The rights of holders of the Series A Preferred Stock to participate in the distribution of our assets will rank junior to the prior claims of our current and future creditors and any future series or class of preferred stock we may issue that ranks senior to the Series A Preferred Stock. As of March 29, 2016, 554,596 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, having a liquidation value of $25 per share, are outstanding. If we are forced to liquidate our assets to pay our creditors, we may not have sufficient assets to pay amounts due on any or all of the Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding. We and our subsidiaries have incurred and may in the future incur substantial amounts of debt and other obligations that will rank senior to the Series A Preferred Stock. At March 25, 2016, we had $29.8 million of bank debt, on a consolidated basis, ranking senior to the Series A Preferred Stock. Our credit facility prohibits payments of dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock if we fail to comply with certain financial covenants or, at certain times, if a default or event of default has occurred. Certain of our other existing or future debt instruments may restrict the authorization, payment or setting apart of dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock. Beginning with dividends accruing as of November 1, 2015, our board of directors suspended payment of dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock until such time as the Company has sufficient liquidity to restore payment of such dividends.\nFuture offerings of debt or senior equity securities may adversely affect the market price of the Series A Preferred Stock. If we decide to issue debt or senior equity securities in the future, it is possible that these securities will be governed by an indenture or other instruments containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility. Additionally, any convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of the Series A Preferred Stock and may result in dilution to owners of the Series A Preferred Stock. We and, indirectly, our shareholders, will bear the cost of issuing and servicing such securities. Because our decision to issue debt or equity securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. The holders of the Series A Preferred Stock will bear the risk of our future offerings, reducing the market price of the Series A Preferred Stock and diluting the value of their holdings in us.\nWe may not be able to pay dividends in cash on the Series A Preferred Stock under California law.\nUnder California law, cash dividends may be paid only if either (1) our retained earnings exceed the amount of the distribution plus the amount, if any, of dividends in arrears on shares with preferential dividend rights, or (2) our total assets are not less than the sum of our total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed if we were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of shareholders whose preferential rights on dissolution are superior to those receiving the distribution. Further, notwithstanding these factors, we may not have sufficient cash to pay dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock. Our ability to pay dividends in the future may be impaired if any of the risks described in this report, were to occur. In addition, payment of our dividends depends upon our financial condition and other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time. We cannot make assurances that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make distributions on our Series A Preferred Stock and pay accrued and unpaid dividends in the future, or to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs.\nWe do not expect to pay any cash dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock for the foreseeable future.\nOur board of directors suspended the monthly cash dividend payment on the Series A Preferred Stock as a result of the depressed commodity price environment which has adversely affected our cash flows and liquidity. Accordingly, we do not anticipate that we will pay any cash dividends on shares of our Series A Preferred Stock for the foreseeable future. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon commodity prices, results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our board of directors deems relevant. In addition, we are currently limited in our ability to declare dividends or make distributions on account of our Series A Preferred Stock under the terms of our credit agreement. Additionally, if dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock are in arrears and unpaid for six or more quarterly periods, the holders (voting as a single class) of our outstanding Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to elect two additional directors to our board of directors until paid in full.\nThe Series A Preferred Stock has not been rated.\nWe have not sought to obtain a rating for the Series A Preferred Stock. No assurance can be given, however, that one or more rating agencies might not independently determine to issue such a rating or that such a rating, if issued, would not adversely affect the market price of the Series A Preferred Stock. In addition, we may elect in the future to obtain a rating for the Series A Preferred Stock, which could adversely affect the market price of the Series A Preferred Stock. Ratings only reflect the views of the rating agency or agencies issuing the ratings and such ratings could be revised downward, placed on a watch list or withdrawn entirely at the discretion of the issuing rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. Any such downward revision, placing on a watch list, or withdrawal of a rating could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Series A Preferred Stock.\nHolders of Series A Preferred Stock may not be able to exercise conversion rights upon a Change of Control, and, if exercisable, these conversion rights may not adequately compensate you.\nUpon the occurrence of a Change of Control, each holder of the Series A Preferred Stock will have the right (unless, prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date, we have provided notice of our election to redeem some or all of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by such holder, in which case such holder will have the right only with respect to shares of Series A Preferred Stock that are not called for redemption) to convert some or all of such holder\u2019s Series A Preferred Stock into shares of our common stock (or under specified circumstances involving certain alternative consideration).\nAlthough we generally may not redeem the Series A Preferred Stock prior to October 23, 2017 (and we are subject to a general prohibition on redemptions under the terms of our credit facility prior to the date which is 30 days after all of our obligations and the lender commitments under those credit facilities have been satisfied), we have a special optional redemption right to redeem the Series A Preferred Stock in the event of a Change of Control, and holders of the Series A Preferred Stock will not have the right to convert any shares that we have elected to redeem prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date.\nIf we do not elect to redeem or are prohibited from redeeming the Series A Preferred Stock prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date, then, upon an exercise of the applicable conversion rights, the number of shares of our common stock or other applicable consideration that the holders of Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive will be limited to a maximum of 14.12 multiplied by the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be converted.\nNotwithstanding the above, pursuant to the merger agreement with Davis, we have agreed as part of the reincorporation from California to Delaware, subject to approval of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock, to convert each share of our existing Series A Preferred Stock into 35 shares of common stock prior to giving effect for the reverse split (3.5 shares post reverse split).\nThe market price of the Series A Preferred Stock could be substantially affected by various factors.\nThe market price of the Series A Preferred Stock will depend on many factors, which may change from time to time, including:\n\u25cf\nour suspension of the cash payment of dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock;\n\u25cf\nprevailing interest rates, increases in which may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Series A Preferred Stock;\n\u25cf\ntrading prices of common and preferred equity securities issued by other energy companies;\n\u25cf\nthe annual yield from distributions on the Series A Preferred Stock as compared to yields on other financial instruments;\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic and financial market conditions;\n\u25cf\ngovernment action or regulation;\n\u25cf\nthe financial condition, performance and prospects of us and our competitors;\n\u25cf\nchanges in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts with respect to us, or competitors in our industry;\n\u25cf\nour issuance of additional preferred equity or debt securities; and\n\u25cf\nactual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results of us and our competitors.\nAs a result of these and other factors, investors who purchase the Series A Preferred Stock may experience a decrease, which could be substantial and rapid, in the market price of the Series A Preferred Stock, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects.\nWe may issue additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock and additional series of preferred stock that rank on parity with the Series A Preferred Stock as to dividend rights, rights upon liquidation, or voting rights.\nWe are allowed to issue additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock and additional series of preferred stock that would rank equally to the Series A Preferred Stock as to dividend payments and rights upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our affairs pursuant to our restated articles of incorporation, as amended, and the certificate of determination for the Series A Preferred Stock without any vote of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock. The issuance of additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock and preferred stock that would rank on parity with the Series A Preferred Stock could have the effect of reducing the amounts available to the current holders of our Series A Preferred Stock upon our liquidation or dissolution or the winding up of our affairs. It also may reduce dividend payments to the current holders of the Series A Preferred Stock if we do not have sufficient funds to pay dividends on all Series A Preferred Stock outstanding and other classes of stock with equal priority with respect to dividends.\nIn addition, although holders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to limited voting rights with respect to such matters, the Series A Preferred Stock will vote separately as a class along with the holders of all other classes or series of our equity securities we may issue upon which similar voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable and which are entitled to vote as a class with the Series A Preferred Stock.
