RISK FACTORS\nThe factors that are discussed below, as well as the matters that are generally set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents incorporated by reference herein, could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nA limited number of large customers account for a significant percentage of our net sales, and a substantial reduction in sales to, or gross profit from, or a significant decline in the financial condition of, one or more of these customers can materially adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nOur top ten customers accounted for 40% and 44%, respectively, of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. The loss of, or a significant reduction in sales to, or gross profit from, one or more of our top customers, or significant adverse changes to the terms on which we sell our products to one or more of our top customers, can have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe competitive environment in which our large customers operate is rapidly changing. Office superstores, wholesalers and other traditional office products resellers (especially in our more developed geographies such as the U.S., Europe and Australia) face increasing competition, especially from mass merchants and e-tailers, which is driving changes in the relative market shares of our large customers. In response, our commercial customers, including the office superstores and wholesalers, continue to evolve their businesses by shifting their channel or geographic focus, making changes to their operating models and merchandising strategies and, in many cases, consolidating or divesting unprofitable or unattractive segments of their businesses. In particular, the acquisition of Essendant by Staples, which was under negotiation through much of 2018 and is now complete, brings together two of our large U.S. customers. Additionally, Staples and Office Depot have acquired a number of U.S. independent dealers. We have seen similar consolidating activity and business model changes with large customers in Europe and Australia, where several of our office superstore and wholesaler customers have merged or are under new private equity ownership. We expect these trends to continue.\nOur larger customers generally have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to change their buying patterns, or develop and market their own private label brands that compete with some of our products. In addition, the increasing competition, shifting market share and business model changes have made, and will continue to make, our business relationships with our large customers more challenging and unpredictable. Their size and scale and relative competitive market position make it easier for them to: (i) resist our efforts to increase prices; (ii) demand better pricing, more promotional programs and longer payment terms; (iii) reduce the shelf space allotted to, and carry a narrower assortment of, branded office and school products; (iv) increase the amount of private label products that compete with our branded offerings; and (v) reduce the amount of inventory they hold. Given the significance of these customers to our business, lower sales to our large customers (many of which historically purchased products with relatively higher margins) have, and will continue to have, an adverse impact on our sales, margins and results of operations.\nAdditionally, increased competition, a slowing economy in our key markets or changes in consumer buying habits could adversely affect the financial health of one or more of our large customers which, in turn, could have an adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. The sell-through of our products by our customers is dependent in part on high quality merchandising and an appealing store environment to attract consumers, which requires continuing investments by our customers. Large customers that experience financial difficulties may fail to make such investments or delay them, resulting in lower sales and orders for our products.\nShifts in the channels of distribution for our products have, and could continue to, adversely impact our sales, margins and results of operations.\nDue to the competitive pressures and resulting decline in market share of our traditional commercial customers, including office superstores and wholesalers, as well as the ongoing disruption and uncertainties in these channels (especially in the U.S., Europe and Australia), the key channels of distribution for our products is changing. Our ongoing strategy is to grow sales and market share in the faster growing mass merchant and e-tailer channels, increase our direct sales to independent dealers, and expand distribution into new and growing channels and geographies while maintaining strong margins. We may not be successful in executing against this strategy fast enough to offset the declines we are experiencing in the traditional commercial channels, if at all. Additionally, the changes in our customer and product mix which have resulted, and may continue to result, from the shift in sales and market share away from our traditional commercial customers (which have historically purchased products with higher margins) into these faster growing channels have, and are likely to continue to negatively impact our margins. Our inability to successfully manage the shift away from distribution channels which are declining, and grow sales and market share with customers\nin faster growing channels, could have a material adverse impact on our sales, margins, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nSales of our products may be adversely affected by issues that affect consumer discretionary spending and/or consumer spending decisions during periods of economic uncertainty or weakness.\nOur business depends on consumer discretionary spending, and as a result, our results are highly dependent on consumer and business confidence and the health of the economies in the countries in which we operate. Consumer spending is affected by many factors outside of the Company\u2019s control, including general economic conditions, consumer disposable income levels, consumer confidence levels, the availability, cost and level of consumer debt, the costs of basic necessities and other goods and the effects of the weather or natural disasters. Additionally, during periods of economic uncertainty or weakness, we tend to see our reseller customers reduce inventories both to reduce their own working capital investment and because consumer demand for our products decreases as consumers switch to private label and other branded and/or generic products that compete on price and quality or forgo purchases altogether. Decreases in consumer demand for our products can result in the need to spend more on promotional activities. Overall, adverse changes in economic conditions or sustained periods of economic uncertainty or weakness could negatively affect our earnings and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nThe Company has foreign currency translation and transaction risks that can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s sales, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nApproximately 58% of our net sales for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 were transacted in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. Our primary exposure to local currency movements is in Europe (the Euro, the Swedish krona and the British pound), Australia, Canada, Brazil and Mexico. Currency exchange rates can be volatile especially in times of global, political and economic tension or uncertainty. Additionally, government actions such as currency devaluations, foreign exchange controls, and price or profit controls can further negatively impact foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe fluctuations in the foreign currency rates relative to the U.S. dollar can cause translation, transaction, and other losses, which negatively impact our sales, profitability and cash flow. We source approximately half of our products from China and other Far Eastern countries using U.S. dollars. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies ordinarily has a negative impact on the Company\u2019s reported sales and operating margins, and conversely, the weakening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies ordinarily has a positive impact.\nWhen our cost of goods increases due to a strengthening in the U.S. dollar against the local foreign currency, we will seek to raise prices in our foreign markets in an effort to recover the lost margin. Due to competitive pressures and the timing of these price increases relative to the changes in the foreign currency exchange rates, it is often difficult to increase prices fast enough to fully offset the cumulative impact of the foreign-exchange-related inflation on our cost of goods sold in these markets. From time to time, we may also use hedging instruments to mitigate transactional exposure to changes in foreign currencies. The effectiveness of our hedges in part depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows, which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain demand for our products and services and highly volatile exchange rates. Further, hedging activities may only offset a portion, or none at all, of the material adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place and we may incur significant losses from hedging activities due to factors such as demand volatility and currency fluctuations.\nChallenges related to the highly competitive business environments in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment characterized by low-cost competitors; large, sophisticated customers; low barriers to entry; and competition from a wide range of products and services (including private label products and electronic and digital products and services that can replace or render certain of our products obsolete). ACCO Brands competes with numerous branded consumer products manufacturers as well as numerous private label suppliers and importers, including many of our customers who import their own private label products directly from foreign sources. Many of our competitors have strong, sought-after brands. They also have the ability to manufacture products locally at a lower cost or source them from other countries with lower production costs, both of which can give them a competitive advantage in terms of price under certain circumstances. In addition, retail space devoted to our product categories is limited and, as a result of competitive pressures, many of our customers are closing or reducing the size of their retail locations, and diversifying their product offerings further reducing the available retail space devoted to our products.\nAs a result, our business has been, and is likely to continue to be, affected by actions: (1) by our customers to increase their purchases of private label products or otherwise change product assortments; (2) by current and potential competitors to increase their investment in product and brand development, lower their prices, take advantage of low entry barriers to expand their production, or move production to countries with lower production costs; and (3) by consumers and other end-users to use lower-priced or alternative products. Any such actions could result in lower sales and margins and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur success depends partially on our ability to continue to develop and market innovative products that meet our consumer demands, including price expectations.\nOur competitive position depends on our ability to successfully invest in innovation and product development. That success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate, develop and market products that appeal to the changing needs and preferences of our consumers. We could focus our efforts and investment on new products that ultimately are not accepted by consumers. Likewise, our failure to offer innovative products that meet consumer and other end-user demand could compromise our competitive position and adversely affect our sales, profitability and results of operation.\nOur strategy is partially based on growth through acquisitions and the expansion of our product assortment into new and adjacent product categories that are experiencing higher growth rates. Failure to properly identify, value, manage and integrate acquisitions or to expand into adjacent categories may materially impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur growth strategy includes continued focus on mergers and acquisitions. We are focused on acquiring companies that are either in our existing product categories or geographic markets, which enhance our ability to compete effectively or that have the potential to accelerate our growth or our entry into adjacent product categories.\nWe may not be successful in identifying suitable acquisition opportunities, prevailing against competing potential acquirers, negotiating appropriate acquisition terms, obtaining financing, completing proposed acquisitions, integrating acquired businesses or expanding in new markets or product categories. In addition, an acquisition may not perform as anticipated, be accretive to earnings or prove to be beneficial to our operations and cash flow. If we fail to effectively identify, value, consummate, manage or integrate any acquired company, we may not realize the potential growth opportunities or achieve the financial results anticipated at the time of its acquisition.\nAn acquisition could also adversely impact our operating performance as a result of the issuance of acquisition-related debt, pre-acquisition assumed liabilities, undisclosed facts about the business, acquisition expense and the amortization of acquired assets or possible future impairments of goodwill or intangible assets associated with the acquisition.\nTo the extent acquisitions increase our exposure to emerging markets, the risks associated with doing business in these markets will increase. See also \"- Growth in emerging geographies may be difficult to achieve and exposes us to financial, operational, regulatory and compliance and other risks not present or not as prevalent as in more established markets.\"\nAdditionally, part of our strategy is to expand our product assortment into new and adjacent product categories with a higher growth profile. There can be no assurance that we will successfully execute these strategies. If we are unable to successfully increase sales by expanding our product assortment, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe may face challenges with integrating acquisitions and achieving the financial and other results anticipated at the time of acquisition, including the planned synergies.\nWe may face challenges in integrating our acquisitions with our existing operations. These challenges may include, among other things: integrating the business cultures; possible difficulties in retaining key employees and key customers; and the difficulty of integrating the acquired business's finance, accounting and other business systems without negatively impacting our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures.\nThe process of integrating operations also could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of one or more of our businesses. Members of our senior management may need to devote considerable amounts of time to the integration process. If our senior management is not able to effectively manage the integration processes, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, our business and financial results could suffer.\nAdditionally, we generally expect that we will realize synergy cost savings and other financial and operating benefits from our acquisitions. Our success in realizing these synergy savings and other financial and operating benefits, and the timing of this realization, depends on the successful integration of the business operations of the acquired company. We cannot predict with certainty if or when these synergy savings and other benefits will occur, or the extent to which we will be successful.\nFinally, the integration of any acquisition will involve changes to, or implementation of critical information technology systems, modifications to our internal control systems, processes and accounting and financial systems, and the establishment of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting necessary to meet our obligations as a public company. Failure to successfully complete any of these tasks could adversely affect our internal control over financial reporting, our disclosure controls and procedures and our ability to effectively and timely report our financial results. If we are unable to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner and establish internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures that are effective, our business, results of operation and financial condition, investor, supplier and customer confidence in our reported financial information, the market perception of our Company and/or the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected.\nChanges in U.S. trade policies and regulations, as well as the overall uncertainty surrounding international trade relations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in U.S. trade policies, including tariffs on imports from China and on steel and aluminum that we use in our U.S. manufacturing operations, have had, and we expect that they will continue to have, an adverse effect on our cost of products sold and margins in our North America segment. Additionally, further changes in U.S. trade policies appear likely, including additional import tariffs, and could adversely impact our business. In response to these changes, other countries have and may continue to change their own trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs and quotas, which could also adversely affect our business outside the U.S. The uncertainty surrounding U.S. trade policy makes it difficult to make long-term strategic decisions regarding the best way to respond to these pressures and could also increase the volatility of currency exchange rates. Further, the knock-on effect of the tariffs has resulted in an increase in the cost of U.S.-sourced products commensurate with the tariffs.\nIn order to mitigate the impact of these trade-related increases on our cost of products sold, we have increased, and intend to continue to increase prices in the U.S., if necessary, to recover any increased costs. Over the longer term, we may make changes in our supply chain and, potentially, our U.S. manufacturing strategy. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully pass on these costs through price increases or adjust our supply chain by locating alternative suppliers for raw materials or finished goods at acceptable costs or in a timely manner. Additionally, implementing price increases may cause our customers to find alternative sources for their products or decrease their purchases from us. Conversely, when tariffs decline, customer demands for lower prices could result in lower sale prices and, to the extent we have existing inventory, lower margins. As a result, fluctuations in tariffs have had, and will continue to have, a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur inability to effectively manage the negative impacts of changing U.S. and foreign trade policies, including tariffs, could materially adversely impact our sales, margins, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely extensively on information technology systems to operate, transact and otherwise manage our business. Any material failure, inadequacy, or interruption of that technology or its supporting infrastructure could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely extensively on our information technology systems, many of which are outsourced to third-party service providers. We depend on these systems and our third-party service providers to effectively manage our business and execute the production, distribution and sale of our products as well as to manage and report our financial results and run other support functions. Although we have implemented service level agreements and have established monitoring controls, if our third-party service providers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory levels, our business could suffer. Additionally, our failure to properly maintain and successfully upgrade or replace any of these systems, especially our enterprise resource planning systems (including our financial systems) so that they operate effectively, could disrupt service to our customers or negatively impact our ability to report our financial results in a timely and accurate manner.\nOur information technology general controls are an important element of our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures. Failure to successfully execute our information technology general controls could adversely impact the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures and impair our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results.\nIf services to our customers are negatively impacted by the failure of our information technology systems, if we are unable to accurately and timely report our financial results, or conclude that we do not have effective internal control over financial reporting and effective disclosure controls and procedures, it could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSecurity breaches could compromise our confidential and proprietary information, as well as any personally identifiable information we hold, and expose us to operational and legal risks which could cause our business and reputation to suffer and materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe maintain information necessary to conduct our business in digital form, which is stored in data centers and on our networks and third-party cloud services, including confidential and proprietary information as well as personally identifiable information regarding our customers and employees. Data maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of intrusion, tampering and theft. Our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions.\nWe maintain systems designed to prevent such intrusion, tampering and theft. The development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts by hackers to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. Further, we obtain assurances from third parties to whom we provide confidential, proprietary and personally identifiable information regarding the sufficiency of their security procedures and, where appropriate, assess the protections employed by these third parties. The cost and operational consequences of implementing, maintaining and further enhancing cybersecurity protection measures could increase significantly as cybersecurity threats increase.\nDespite these efforts, the possibility of intrusion, tampering and theft cannot be eliminated entirely. We have from time to time experienced cybersecurity breaches, such as \"phishing\" attacks, employee or insider error, brute force attacks, unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems and similar incidents. To date these incidents have not had a material impact on our business, but there can be no assurance that future incidents will not have a material impact. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target. Additionally, there can be no assurance that the actions we and our third party providers are taking and will continue to take will prevent another breach of, or attack on the information technology systems which house our confidential, proprietary and personally identifiable information. Any such breach or attack could compromise our network, the network of a third party to whom we have disclosed confidential, proprietary or personally identifiable information, a data center where we have stored such information or a third-party cloud service provider, and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen.\nAny such intrusion, tampering or theft and any resulting disclosure or other loss of such information could result in a disruption to our information technology infrastructure, interruption of our business operations, violation of applicable privacy and other laws or standards, significant legal and financial exposure beyond the scope or limits of any insurance coverage (including legal claims and proceedings and regulatory enforcement actions and penalties), increased operating costs associated with remediation activities, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, all of which could harm our reputation with our customers, end-users, employees and other stakeholders and adversely affect our results of operation. Contractual provisions with third parties, including cloud service providers, may limit our ability to recover these losses.\nAdditionally, we are an acquisitive organization and the process of integrating the information technology systems of the businesses we acquire is complex and exposes us to additional risk as we might not adequately identify weaknesses in the targets' information technology systems. This could expose us to unexpected liabilities or make our own systems more vulnerable to attack.\nGrowth in emerging geographies may be difficult to achieve and exposes us to financial, operational, regulatory and compliance and other risks not present or not as prevalent as in more established markets.\nA portion of our sales are derived from emerging markets such as Latin America and parts of Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Eastern Europe. Moreover, the profitable growth of our business in emerging markets, through both organic investments and through acquisitions, is a key element to our long-term growth strategy.\nEmerging markets generally involve more financial, operational, regulatory and compliance risks than more mature markets. In some cases, emerging markets have greater political and economic volatility, greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions, are more susceptible to corruption and have different laws and regulations. Further, these emerging markets are generally more remote from our headquarters location and have different cultures which may make it be more difficult to impose corporate standards and procedures and the extraterritorial laws of the U.S. and other jurisdictions, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other similar laws. Negative or uncertain political climates and military disruptions\nin developing and emerging markets could also adversely affect us. Further, weak or corrupt legal systems may affect our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property, contractual and other rights.\nAs we seek to expand and grow in these emerging markets, we increase our exposure to these financial, operational, and regulatory and compliance risks as well as legal and other risks, including currency transfer restrictions, the impact of currency fluctuations, hyperinflation or devaluation, changes in international trade and tax policies and regulations (including import and export restrictions), the lack of well-established or reliable legal systems, corruption, adverse economic conditions, political actions or instability, terrorism and civil unrest. Likewise, our overall cost of doing business increases due to the costs of compliance with complex and numerous foreign and U.S. laws and regulations.\nIf we are unable to successfully expand into emerging markets, profitably grow our existing emerging market businesses, achieve the return on capital we expect as a result of our investments, or effectively manage the risks inherent in our growth strategy in these markets, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nThe anticipated positive effects of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"U.S. Tax Act\") on our financial results may not be fully realized and could adversely impact our net income and cash flow.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Act was signed into law. The U.S. Tax Act made broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, including, but not limited to: (i) reducing the future U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent; (ii) requiring companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries (the \"Transition Toll Tax\"); (iii) bonus depreciation that will allow for full expensing of qualified property; (iv) a general elimination of U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; (v) a new provision designed to tax global intangible low-taxed income (\"GILTI\"); (vi) the repeal of domestic production activity deductions; (vii) limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation expenses; (viii) limitations on the use of foreign tax credits to reduce U.S. income tax liability; and (ix) a new provision that allows a domestic corporation an immediate deduction for a portion of its foreign derived intangible income (\"FDII\").\nThe initially anticipated positive effects of the U.S. Tax Act on our financial results have been mitigated by a reduction in the overall percentage mix of our earnings from the U.S. and other unfavorable provisions of the new law. In 2018, the benefits associated with the lower U.S. federal corporate tax rate were offset by the impact of the GILTI tax and the limitations on deductibility of executive compensation expenses as well as a reduction in the overall percentage of our earnings from the U.S. The evolving regulations and interpretations still being issued by the IRS could change our understanding of, and assumptions pertaining to, the application of the U.S. Tax Act. Likewise, the manner in which the U.S. Tax Act will be enforced is still uncertain. In addition, a further reduction in the overall percentage mix of our earnings from the U.S. could further reduce the anticipated benefits of the lower corporate tax rate. As a result of these factors, the aggregate impact of the U.S. Tax Act on our tax rate, cash taxes and net income could change and any such change could adversely impact our net income and cash flow.\nLitigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation.\nWe are party to various lawsuits and regulatory proceedings, primarily related to alleged patent infringement as well as other claims incidental to our business. In addition, we may be unaware of third party claims of intellectual property infringement relating to our technology, brands or products and we may face other claims related to business operations. Any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and might require us to pay monetary damages or enter into costly license agreements. We also may be subject to injunctions against development and sale of certain of our products.\nIt is the opinion of management that (other than the Brazilian Tax Assessment) the ultimate resolution of currently outstanding matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. However, there is no assurance that we will ultimately be successful in our defense of any of these matters or that an adverse outcome in any matter will not affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flow. Further, future claims, lawsuits and legal proceedings could materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn connection with our May 1, 2012 acquisition of the Mead Consumer and Office Products business (\"Mead C&OP\"), we assumed all of the tax liabilities for the acquired foreign operations including Tilibra Produtos de Papelaria Ltda. (\"Tilibra\"). In December of 2012, the Federal Revenue Department of the Ministry of Finance of Brazil (\"FRD\") issued a tax assessment (the \"Brazilian Tax Assessment\") against Tilibra, which challenged the tax deduction of goodwill from Tilibra's taxable income for the year 2007 (the \"First Assessment\"). A second assessment challenging the deduction of goodwill from Tilibra's taxable income for the years 2008, 2009 and 2010 was issued by FRD in October 2013 (the \"Second Assessment\"). Tilibra is disputing both of the tax assessments.\nThe final administrative appeal of the Second Assessment was decided against the Company in 2017. We are challenging this decision in court. In connection with the judicial challenge, we are required to provide security to guarantee payment of the Second Assessment, which represents $21.0 million of the current reserve, should we not prevail. The First Assessment is still being challenged through established administrative procedures.\nWe believe we have meritorious defenses and intend to vigorously contest these matters; however, there can be no assurances that we will ultimately prevail. The ultimate outcome will not be determined until the Brazilian tax appeal process is complete, which is expected to take a number of years. If the FRD's initial position is ultimately sustained, the amount assessed would materially and adversely affect our cash flow in the year of settlement.\nBecause there is no settled legal precedent on which to base a definitive opinion as to whether we will ultimately prevail, we consider the outcome of this dispute to be uncertain. Since it is not more likely than not that we will prevail, in 2012, we recorded a reserve in the amount of $44.5 million (at December 31, 2012 exchange rates) in consideration of this contingency, of which $43.3 million was recorded as an adjustment to the purchase price and which included the 2007-2012 tax years plus penalties and interest through December 2012. Included in this reserve is an assumption of penalties at 75%, which is the standard penalty. While there is a possibility that a penalty of 150% could be imposed in connection with the First Assessment, based on the facts in our case and existing precedent, we believe the likelihood of a 150% penalty is not more likely than not as of December 31, 2018. We will continue to actively monitor administrative and judicial court decisions and evaluate their impact, if any, on our legal assessment of the ultimate outcome of our case. In addition, we will continue to accrue interest related to this contingency until such time as the outcome is known or until evidence is presented that we are more likely than not to prevail. The time limit for issuing an assessment for 2011 expired in January 2018 and we did not receive an assessment; we therefore reversed $5.6 million of reserves related to 2011 in the first quarter of 2018. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we accrued additional interest as a charge to current tax expense of $1.1 million, $2.2 million and $2.8 million, respectively. At current exchange rates, our accrual through December 31, 2018, including tax, penalties and interest is $29.4 million. The time limit for issuing an assessment for 2012 expired in January 2019 and we did not receive an assessment.\nOutsourcing the production of certain of our products, our information technology systems and other administrative functions could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe outsource certain manufacturing functions to suppliers in China, other Asia-Pacific countries and Eastern Europe. Outsourcing of product design and production creates a number of risks, including decreased control over the engineering and manufacturing processes resulting in unforeseen production delays or interruptions, inferior product quality, loss or misappropriation of trade secrets and other performance issues, which could result in cost overruns, delayed deliveries or shortages. Additionally, we rely on our suppliers to ensure that our products meet our design and product content specifications, and all applicable laws, including product safety, security, labor and environmental laws. We also expect our suppliers to conform to our and our customers\u2019 expectations with respect to product safety, product quality and social responsibility, be responsive to our audits and otherwise be certified as meeting our and our customers\u2019 supplier codes of conduct. Failure to meet any of these requirements may result in our having to cease doing business with a supplier or cease production at a particular facility. Substitute suppliers might not be available or, if available, might be unwilling or unable to offer products on acceptable terms or in a timely manner. Additionally, failure to meet legal and regulatory requirements or customer expectations may result in our having to stop selling non-conforming products until the issues are remediated. Any of these circumstances could result in unforeseen delays and increased costs and negatively affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers, all of which could adversely affect our business, sales, results of operations and financial condition.\nMoreover, if one or more of our suppliers is unable or unwilling to continue to provide products of acceptable quality, at acceptable cost or in a timely manner due to financial difficulties, insolvency or otherwise, or if customer demand for our products increases, we may be unable to secure sufficient additional capacity from our current suppliers, or others, in a timely manner or on acceptable terms. Any of these events could result in unforeseen production delays and increased costs and negatively affect our ability to deliver our products to our customers, all of which could adversely affect our business, sales, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe also outsource important portions of our information technology infrastructure and systems support to third party service providers. Outsourcing of information technology services creates risks to our business, which are similar to those created by our product production outsourcing. If one or more of our information technology suppliers is unable or unwilling to continue to provide services at acceptable cost due to financial difficulties, insolvency or otherwise, or if our third party service providers experience a security breach or disruptions in service, our business could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, we outsource certain administrative functions, such as payroll processing and benefit plan administration to third party service providers and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies. If the service\nproviders to whom we outsource these functions do not perform effectively, we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings and may have to incur additional costs to correct errors they make. Depending on the function involved, such errors may lead to business disruption, processing inefficiencies or loss of, or damage to intellectual property, legal and regulatory exposure, or harm to employee morale.\nContinued declines in the use of certain of our products have and could continue to adversely affect our business.\nA number of our products and brands consist of paper-based and related products. As use of technology-based tools continues to rise worldwide, consumer demand for traditional paper-based and related products, such as decorative calendars, planners, envelopes, ring binders, lever arch files and other storage and organization products, and mechanical binding equipment, has declined. The impact of tariff and commodity price driven inflation in the U.S. also has the potential to result in higher pricing (especially for paper-based products) which may, in turn, accelerate the pace of change in consumer preferences for product substitutes. Continuation or acceleration of the decline in the overall demand for any of the products we sell has, and could continue to, adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to risks associated with seasonality, which could materially adversely affect our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition.\nHistorically, our business has experienced higher sales and earnings in the third and fourth quarters of the calendar year and we expect these trends to continue. Two principal factors contribute to this seasonality: (1) we are a major supplier of products related to the back-to-school season, which occurs principally from June through September for our businesses in North America and from November through February for our Australian and Brazilian businesses; and (2) several product categories we sell lend themselves to calendar year-end purchase timing, including planners, paper storage and organization products (including bindery) and Kensington\u00ae computer accessories, which have higher sales in the fourth quarter driven by traditionally strong fourth-quarter sales of personal computers and tablets. As a result, we have generated, and expect to continue to generate, most of our earnings and much of our cash flow in the second half of the year as receivables are collected. If these typical seasonal increases in sales of certain products do not materialize or when sales of these product lines represent a larger overall percentage of our sales or profitability, it could have an outsized impact on our business that would adversely affect our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operating results have, and may continue to be, adversely affected by changes in cost of products sold, including the cost or availability of raw materials, transportation, labor, and other necessary supplies and services and the cost of finished goods.\nPricing and availability of raw materials, transportation, labor, and other necessary supplies and services used in our business can be volatile due to numerous factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions, labor costs, production levels, and import tariffs as well as overall competitive conditions, including demand and supply. This volatility has, and may continue to, significantly affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe also rely on third-party manufacturers, principally in China, as a source for many of our finished products. These manufacturers are also subject to changes in the cost or availability of raw materials, transportation, labor, and other necessary supplies and services, which may, in turn, result in an increase in the amount we pay for finished goods.\nDuring periods of rising costs, we manage this volatility through a variety of actions, including periodic purchases, future delivery purchases, long-term contracts, sales price increases and the use of certain derivative instruments. Over the longer term, we may also make adjustments in our supply chain in an effort to mitigate the adverse impact of increasing costs. There can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively mitigate the impact on our cost of products sold fast enough to preserve our margins, if at all. Additionally, we may lose sales as we seek to offset these cost increases by raising prices to our customers. Conversely, when input costs decline, customer demands for lower prices could result in lower sale prices and, to the extent we have existing inventory, lower margins. As a result, fluctuations in costs of raw materials, transportation, labor, and finished goods has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe primary materials used in the manufacturing of many of our products are paper, plastics, resin, polyester and polypropylene substrates, steel, wood, aluminum, melamine, zinc and cork. During 2018, we experienced significant increases in the cost of paper, steel and aluminum as well as increases in transportation costs. While we believe the situation has stabilized somewhat, we may see further increases in the cost of raw materials, finished goods and transportation.\nThe risks associated with our failure to comply with laws, rules and regulations and self-regulatory requirements that affect our business, and the costs of compliance, as well as the impact of changes in such laws could materially adversely affect our business, reputation and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to national, state, provincial and/or local laws, rules and regulations as well as self-regulatory requirements in numerous countries due to the nature of our operations and the products we sell. This, in turn, affects the way we conduct our business as well as our customers\u2019 expectations and requirements. Among others, laws and self-regulatory requirements in the following significant areas (and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder) affect our business and our current and prospective customers\u2019 expectations:\n\u2022\nLaws relating to the discharge and emission of certain materials and waste, and establishing standards for their use, disposal and management;\n\u2022\nLaws governing content of toxic chemicals and materials in the products we sell;\n\u2022\nProduct safety laws;\n\u2022\nInternational trade laws;\n\u2022\nPrivacy and data security laws;\n\u2022\nSelf-regulatory requirements regarding the acceptance, processing, storage and transmission of credit card data;\n\u2022\nLaws governing the use of the internet, social media, advertising, endorsements and testimonials;\n\u2022\nAnti-bribery and corruption laws;\n\u2022\nAnti-money laundering laws; and\n\u2022\nCompetition laws.\nAll of these legal frameworks are complex and may change frequently. Capital and operating expenses required to establish and maintain compliance with all of these laws, rules and regulations and self-regulatory requirements can be significant, and violations may result in substantial fines, penalties and civil damages as well as damage to our reputation. Any significant increase in our costs to comply with applicable legal and self-regulatory requirements, or liability arising from noncompliance could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition as well as damage to our reputation.\nIn addition, as we expand our business into emerging and new markets, we increase the number of legal and self-regulatory requirements with which we are required to comply, which increases the complexity and costs of compliance as well as the risks of noncompliance.\nThe level of investment returns on pension and post-retirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect the Company\u2019s earnings and cash flows in future periods. Changes in government regulations could also affect the Company\u2019s pension and post-retirement plan expenses and funding requirements.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company had $258.3 million recorded as pension liabilities in its Consolidated Balance Sheet. The funding obligations for the Company\u2019s pension plans are impacted by the performance of the financial markets, particularly the equity markets, and interest rates. Funding obligations are determined by government regulations and are measured each year based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date. If the financial markets do not provide the long-term returns that are expected, the Company could be required to make larger contributions. The equity markets can be, and recently have been, very volatile, and therefore the Company\u2019s estimate of future contribution requirements can change dramatically in relatively short periods of time. Similarly, changes in interest rates and legislation enacted by governmental authorities can impact the timing and amounts of contribution requirements. An adverse change in the funded status of the plans could significantly increase the Company\u2019s required contributions in the future and adversely impact its liquidity.\nAssumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for the Company\u2019s pension and post-retirement benefit plans are determined by the Company in consultation with outside actuaries. In the event that the Company determines that changes are warranted in the assumptions used, such as the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on assets, expected health care costs, or mortality rates, the Company\u2019s future pension and post-retirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease. Due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population, the assumptions that the Company uses may differ from actual results, which could have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s pension and post-retirement liabilities and related costs and funding requirements.\nWe also participate in a multi-employer pension plan for our union employees at our Ogdensburg, New York facility. The plan has reported significant underfunded liabilities and declared itself in critical and declining status. As a result, the trustees of the plan adopted a rehabilitation plan in an effort to forestall insolvency. Our required contributions to this plan could increase due to the shrinking contribution base resulting from the insolvency or withdrawal of other participating employers, the inability or the failure of withdrawing participating employers to pay their withdrawal liability, lower than expected returns on pension fund\nassets, and other funding deficiencies. In the event that we withdraw from participation in the plan, we will be required to make withdrawal liability payments for a period of 20 years or longer in certain circumstances. The present value of our withdrawal liability payments could be significant and would be recorded as an expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income and as a liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets in the first year of our withdrawal.\nSee also \"Part II, Item 7. Critical Accounting Policies - Employee Benefit Plans\" and \"Note 6. Pension and Other Retiree Benefits\" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8. of this report.\nImpairment of intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe have approximately $1.5 billion of goodwill and other specifically identifiable intangible assets as of December 31, 2018. Future events may occur that could adversely affect the reported value, or fair value, of our intangible assets that would require impairment charges to our financial results. Such events may include, but are not limited to, strategic decisions made in response to changes in economic and competitive conditions, the impact of the economic environment on the Company\u2019s sales and customer base, the unfavorable resolution of litigation, a material adverse change in the Company\u2019s relationship with significant customers, or a sustained decline in the Company\u2019s stock price. The Company continues to evaluate the impact of developments from its reporting units to assess whether impairment indicators are present. Accordingly, the Company may be required to perform impairment tests based on whether or not indicators are present. In addition, the Company performs an impairment test on an annual basis in the second quarter, as required by GAAP whether or not impairment indicators are present. See also \"Part II, Item 7. Critical Accounting Policies - Intangible Assets,\" \" - Goodwill\" and \"Note 10. Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets\" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8. of this report.\nOur existing borrowing arrangements require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to debt payments and limit our ability to engage in certain activities. If we are unable to meet our obligations under these agreements or are contractually restricted from pursuing activities or transactions that we believe are in our long-term best interests, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $888.0 million of outstanding debt.\nOur debt service obligations require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operating activities to payments on our indebtedness, which reduces the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and product development efforts, potential acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes. Our indebtedness also may increase our vulnerability to economic downturns and changing market conditions and place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors that have less debt. In addition, as of December 31, 2018, $512.7 million of our outstanding debt is subject to floating interest rates, which increases our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.\nThe terms of our debt agreements also limit our ability to engage in certain activities and transactions that may be in our and our stockholders' long-term interest. Among other things, the covenants and financial ratios and tests contained in our debt agreements restrict or limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, incur certain liens on our assets, issue preferred stock or certain disqualified stock, make restricted payments (including dividends and share repurchases), make investments, sell our assets or merge with other companies, and enter into certain transactions with affiliates. We are also required to maintain specified financial ratios under certain circumstances and satisfy financial condition tests. Our ability to comply with these covenants and financial ratios and tests may be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to continue to meet those covenants, ratios and tests.\nOur ability to meet our debt obligations, including our financial covenants, and to refinance our existing indebtedness upon maturity, will depend upon our future operating performance, which will be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory, business and other factors. Breach of any of the covenants, ratios and tests contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness, or our inability to pay interest on, or principal of, our outstanding debt as it becomes due, could result in an event of default, in which case our lenders could declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable. If our lenders accelerate our indebtedness, or we are not able to refinance our debts at maturity, our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full such indebtedness and any other indebtedness that would become due as a result of such acceleration. If we then are unable to obtain replacement financing or any such replacement financing is on terms that are less favorable than the indebtedness being replaced, our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nShould any of the risks associated with our indebtedness be realized, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. See also \"Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\"\nShould one of our large customers or suppliers experience financial difficulties or file for bankruptcy, our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nOur customer concentration increases our customer credit risk. If any of our larger customers were to face liquidity issues, become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, we could be adversely impacted due to not only a reduction in future sales but also delays in the payment of existing accounts receivable balances. Such a result could adversely impact our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, should one of our suppliers or third party service providers experience financial difficulties, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur failure to comply with customer contracts may lead to fines or loss of business, which could adversely impact our revenue and results of operations\nOur contracts with our customers include specific performance requirements. If we fail to comply with the specific provisions of our customer contracts, we could be subject to fines, suffer a loss of business or incur other penalties. If our customer contracts are terminated, if we fail to meet our contractual obligations, or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected, we could suffer a reduction in expected revenue and margins.\nOur inability to secure, protect and maintain rights to intellectual property could have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe consider our intellectual property rights, particularly and most notably our trademarks and trade names, but also our patents, trade secrets, trade dress, copyrights and licensing agreements, to be an important and valuable part of our business. Our failure to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property rights, or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property, may diminish our competitiveness, dilute the value of our brands, cause confusion in the marketplace and materially impact our sales and profitability.\nProduct liability claims, recalls or regulatory actions could materially adversely affect our financial results or harm our reputation or brands.\nClaims for losses or injuries purportedly caused by one of our products arise in the ordinary course of our business. In addition to the risk of litigation or regulatory enforcement actions and the associated costs and potential for monetary judgments and penalties, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, product liability claims or regulatory actions, regardless of merit, could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation in the marketplace or the value of our consumer brands. We also could be required to recall and possibly discontinue the sale of defective or unsafe products, which could result in adverse publicity, significant expenses and adverse impacts to our financial position.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, including executive officers and other key personnel for a diverse, global workforce. We rely to a significant degree on compensating our executive officers and key employees with performance-based incentive awards that pay out only if specified performance goals have been met. To the extent these performance goals are not met and our incentive awards do not pay out, or pay out less than the targeted amount, it may motivate certain executive officers and key employees to seek other opportunities and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. The loss of key management personnel or other key employees or our potential inability to attract such personnel may adversely affect our ability to manage our overall operations and successfully implement our business strategy.\nOur stock price is volatile.\nThe market price for our common stock has been volatile historically. Our stock price may be significantly affected by factors including those described elsewhere in this \"Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\" as well as the following:\n\u2022quarterly fluctuations in our operating results compared to market expectations;\n\u2022investors' perceptions of the office products industry;\n\u2022amounts we repurchase on the open market under our share repurchase program;\n\u2022changes in financial estimates by us or securities analysts and recommendations by securities analysts; and\n\u2022the composition of our stockholders, particularly the presence of \"short sellers\" trading in our stock.\nVolatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensation to our employees or grant larger stock awards, which could hurt our operating results and reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders.\nMaterial disruptions resulting from telecommunication failures, labor strikes, power and/or water shortages, acts of God, war, terrorism, other geopolitical incidents or other circumstances outside our control could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nA disruption at one of our facilities or at a third-party service provider\u2019s facilities (especially facilities in China, other Asia-Pacific countries and Latin America) could adversely impact production, and our customer deliveries which can negatively impact our operations and result in increased costs. Such a disruption could occur as a result of any number of events, including but not limited to, a major equipment failure, labor stoppages, transportation failures affecting the supply and shipment of materials and finished goods, the unavailability of raw materials, severe weather conditions, natural disasters, civil unrest, fire, explosions, health pandemics, war or terrorism and disruptions in utility and other services. Any such disruptions could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 90825, "SIC": 2780, "TIC": "ACCO"}
