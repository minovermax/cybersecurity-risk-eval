Risk Factors.\nIn addition to other risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report, the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our business because such factors may have a significant impact on our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition. As a result of the risk factors set forth below, actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements.\nOur financial condition raises substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur independent registered certified public accounting firm has included in their audit opinion on our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014 a statement with respect to substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue to operate as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. If we become unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets and the values we receive for our assets in liquidation or dissolution could be significantly lower than the values reflected in our financial statements. The substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern may adversely affect our ability to negotiate reasonable terms with our suppliers and may adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital in the future.\nWe have had a history of losses which may ultimately compromise our ability to implement our business plan and continue in operation.\nWe have had losses in each year since our inception in 1989, and continue to have an accumulated deficit which, at December 31, 2014, was approximately $313.6 million. The net loss for 2014 was approximately $23.6 million. To date, our technologies and products have not produced revenues sufficient to cover operating, research and development and overhead costs. We will continue to make expenditures on patent protection and enforcement, research and development, marketing, and general operations in order to secure and fulfill any contracts that we achieve for the sale of our products or technologies. We expect that our revenues in 2015 will not bring the Company to profitability and our current capital resources will not be sufficient to sustain our operations through 2015. If we are not able to generate sufficient revenues or obtain sufficient capital resources, we will not be able to implement our\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nbusiness plan and investors will suffer a loss in their investment. This may also result in a change in our business strategies.\nWe expect to need additional capital in the future. Failure to raise such additional capital may prevent us from implementing our business plan as currently formulated.\nBecause we have had net losses and, to date, have not generated positive cash flow from operations, we have funded our operating losses from the sale of equity securities from time to time. We anticipate that our business plan will continue to require significant expenditures for patent protection and enforcement, research and development, marketing, and general operations. Furthermore, we expect that the implementation of significant cost reduction measures in order to reduce our cash needs may jeopardize our operations and future growth plans. Our current capital resources include cash and available-for-sale securities of $11.2 million at December 31, 2014 and $1.3 million in net proceeds from our January 2015 sale of warrants. In addition, we have a $7 million litigation funding commitment from a third-party; however, this funding is for specified use in future, not existing, patent enforcement actions. These capital resources will not be sufficient to meet our working capital needs for 2015 and we will require additional capital to fund our operations. Financing, if any, may be in the form of debt, contingent fee arrangements, or additional sales of equity securities, including common or preferred stock. The incurrence of debt or the sale of preferred stock may result in the imposition of operational limitations and other covenants and payment obligations, any of which may be burdensome to us. Contingent fee arrangements may result in a significant reduction in net earnings from litigation and/or licensing activities. The sale of equity securities, including common or preferred stock, may result in dilution to the current shareholders\u2019 ownership. The long-term continuation of our business plan is dependent upon the generation of sufficient revenues from patent enforcement actions or the sale or license of our products or technologies, additional funding, reducing expenses or a combination of the foregoing. The failure to generate sufficient revenues, raise capital or reduce expenses will have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our long-term business objectives.\nIf our patents and intellectual property rights do not provide us with the anticipated market protections, our competitive position, business, and prospects will be impaired.\nWe rely on our intellectual property rights, including patents and patent applications, to provide competitive advantage and protect us from theft of our intellectual property. We believe that our patents are for entirely new technologies and that our patents are valid, enforceable and valuable. However, third parties have made claims of invalidity with respect to certain of our patents and other similar claims may be brought in the future. If our patents are shown not to be as broad as currently believed, or are otherwise challenged such that some or all of the protection is lost, we will suffer adverse effects from the loss of competitive advantage and our ability to offer unique products and technologies. As a result, there would be an adverse impact on our financial condition and business prospects. Furthermore, defending against challenges to our patents may give rise to material costs for defense and divert resources away from our other activities.\nOur litigation can be time-consuming, costly and we cannot anticipate the results.\nSince 2011, we have spent a significant amount of our financial and management resources to pursue patent infringement litigation against third parties. We believe this litigation, and others that we may in the future determine to pursue, could continue to consume management and financial resources for long periods of time. There can be no assurance that our current or future litigation matters will ultimately result in a favorable outcome for us. In addition, even if we obtain favorable interim rulings or verdicts in particular litigation matters, they may not be predictive of the ultimate resolution of the matter. Unfavorable outcomes could result in exhaustion of our financial resources and could otherwise hinder our ability to pursue licensing and/or product opportunities for our technologies which would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and business prospects. Furthermore, any litigation-based awards collected will be subject to contingency payments to\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nlegal counsel and/or funding parties which will reduce the amount retained by us.\nWe are subject to outside influences beyond our control, including new legislation that could adversely affect our licensing and enforcement activities and have an adverse impact on the execution of our business plan.\nOur licensing and enforcement activities are subject to numerous risks from outside influences, including new legislation, regulations and rules related to obtaining or enforcing patents. For instance, the U.S. recently enacted sweeping changes to the U.S. patent system including changes that transition the U.S. from a \u201cfirst-to-invent\u201d to a \u201cfirst to file\u201d system and that alter the processes for challenging issued patents. To the extent that we are unable to secure patent protection for our future technologies and/or our current patents are challenged such that some or all of our protection is lost, we will suffer adverse effects to our ability to offer unique products and technologies. As a result, there would be an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows and our ability to execute our business plan.\nOur industry is subject to rapid technological changes which if we are unable to match or surpass, will result in a loss of competitive advantage and market opportunity.\nBecause of the rapid technological development that regularly occurs in the wireless technology industry, we must continually devote substantial resources to developing and improving our technology and introducing new product offerings. For example, in fiscal years 2014 and 2013, we spent approximately $8.5 million and $10.4 million, respectively, on research and development and, we expect to continue to spend a significant amount in this area in the future. These efforts and expenditures are necessary to establish market share and, ultimately, to generate revenues. If another company offers better products or technologies, a competitive position or market window opportunity may be lost, and therefore our revenues or revenue potential may be adversely affected.\nIf our technologies and/or products are not commercially accepted, our developmental investment will be lost and our ability to do business will be impaired.\nThere can be no assurance that our research and development will produce commercially viable technologies and products, or that our technologies and products will be established in the market as improvements over current competitive offerings. If our existing or new technologies and products are not commercially accepted, the funds expended will not be recoverable, and our competitive and financial position will be adversely affected. In addition, perception of our business prospects will be impaired with an adverse impact on our ability to do business and to attract capital and employees.\nOur business is highly reliant on our business relationships with baseband suppliers for support of the interface of their product to our technology and the support of our sales and marketing efforts to their customers, the failure of which will have an adverse impact on our business.\nThe successful commercialization of our products will be impacted, in part, by factors outside of our control including the success and timing of product development and sales support activities of the suppliers of baseband processors with which our products interface. Delays in or failure of a baseband supplier\u2019s product development or sales support activities will hinder the commercialization of our products which will have an adverse impact on our ability to generate revenues and recover development expenses.\nWe rely, in large part, on key business and sales relationships for the successful commercialization of our products, which if not developed or maintained, will have an adverse impact on achieving market awareness and acceptance and will result in a loss of business opportunity.\nTo achieve a wide market awareness and acceptance of our products and technologies, as part of our business strategy, we will attempt to enter into a variety of business relationships with other companies which will incorporate our technologies into their products and/or market products based on our\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ntechnologies. The successful commercialization of our products and technologies will depend in part on our ability to meet obligations under contracts with respect to the products and related development requirements. The failure of these business relationships will limit the commercialization of our products and technologies which will have an adverse impact on our business development and our ability to generate revenues and recover development expenses.\nWe are highly dependent on Mr. Jeffrey Parker as our chief executive officer and Mr. David Sorrells as our chief technology officer. If either of their services were lost, it would have an adverse impact on the execution of our business plan.\nBecause of Mr. Parker\u2019s leadership position in the company and the respect he has garnered in both the industry in which we operate and the investment community, the loss of his services might be seen as an impediment to the execution of our business plan. Because of Mr. Sorrells\u2019 technical expertise, the loss of his services could have an adverse impact on our research, technical support, and enforcement activities and impede the execution of our business plan. If either Mr. Parker or Mr. Sorrells were no longer available to the company, investors might experience an adverse impact on their investment. We currently have employment agreements with and maintain key-employee life insurance for our benefit for both Mr. Parker and Mr. Sorrells.\nIf we are unable to attract or retain key executives and other highly skilled employees, we will not be able to execute our current business plans.\nOur business is very specialized, and therefore it is dependent on having skilled and specialized key executives and other employees to conduct our research, development and customer support activities. The inability to obtain or retain these key executives and other specialized employees would have an adverse impact on the research, development and technical customer support activities that our products require. These activities are instrumental to the successful execution of our business plan.\nOur outstanding options, warrants, and restricted share units may affect the market price and liquidity of the common stock.\nAt December 31, 2014, we had 97,183,433 shares of common stock outstanding and had 9,880,352 options, warrants, and restricted share units (\u201cRSU\u201d) outstanding for the purchase and/or issuance of additional shares of common stock. Of these outstanding equity instruments, 7,209,938 were exercisable as of December 31, 2014. The majority of the shares of common stock underlying these securities is registered for sale to the holder or for public resale by the holder. The amount of common stock available for the sales may have an adverse impact on our ability to raise capital and may affect the price and liquidity of the common stock in the public market. In addition, the issuance of these shares of common stock will have a dilutive effect on current shareholders\u2019 ownership.\nThe price of our common stock may be subject to substantial volatility.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile. Between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2014, the reported high and low sales prices for our common stock ranged between $0.80 and $5.80 per share. The price of our common stock may continue to be volatile as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, developments in outstanding litigations, our performance and prospects, general conditions of the markets in which we compete, and economic and financial conditions. Such volatility could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock in future periods.\nThe bid price of our common stock has been below the minimum requirement for the NASDAQ Capital Market and there can be no assurance that we will continue to maintain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for trading on that market or another national securities exchange.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nFrom time to time, the closing bid price of our common stock has been below the NASDAQ minimum bid price requirement of $1. If the closing bid price remains below the minimum bid price requirement for a period of 30 consecutive business days, we will receive a non-compliance notice from the NASDAQ and will be afforded a 180-day period within which to regain compliance. We are currently in compliance with the NASDAQ minimum bid price requirement. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to maintain compliance. If we are unable to maintain or regain compliance, our common stock may no longer be listed on NASDAQ or another national securities exchange and the liquidity and market price of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nWe do not currently pay dividends on our common stock and thus stockholders must look to appreciation of our common stock to realize a gain on their investments.\nWe do not currently pay dividends on our common stock and intend to retain our cash and future earnings, if any, to fund our business plan. Our future dividend policy is within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon various factors, including our business, financial condition, results of operations and capital requirements. We therefore cannot offer any assurance that our Board of Directors will determine to pay special or regular dividends in the future. Accordingly, unless our Board of Directors determines to pay dividends, stockholders will be required to look to appreciation of our common stock to realize a gain on their investment. There can be no assurance that this appreciation will occur.\nWe may not be able to deliver shares of common stock upon exercise of our public warrants if such issuance has not been registered or qualified or deemed exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the holder of the warrant.\nOn November 3, 2010, we sold warrants to a limited number of institutional investors in an offering under one of our shelf registration statements. The issuance of common stock upon exercise of these warrants must qualify for exemption from registration under the securities laws of the state of residence of the warrant holder. The qualification for exemption from registration may differ in different states. As a result, a warrant may be held by a holder in a state where an exemption is not available for such exercise and we may be precluded from issuing such shares. If our common stock continues to be listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market or another national securities exchange, an exemption from registration for the issuance of common stock upon exercise of these warrants would be available in every state. However, we cannot assure you that our common stock will continue to be so listed. As a result, these warrants may be deprived of any value, the market for these warrants may be limited and the holders of these warrants may not be able to obtain shares of common stock upon exercise of the warrants if the common stock issuable upon such exercise is not qualified or otherwise exempt from qualification in the jurisdictions in which the holders of the warrants reside.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws could have effects that conflict with the interest of shareholders.\nSome provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us. For example, our board of directors is divided into three classes with directors having staggered terms of office, our board of directors has the ability to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval, and there are advance notification provisions for director nominations and submissions of proposals from shareholders to a vote by all the shareholders under the by-laws. Florida law also has anti-takeover provisions in its corporate statute.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe have a shareholder protection rights plan that may delay or discourage someone from making an offer to purchase the company without prior consultation with the board of directors and management, which may conflict with the interests of some of the shareholders.\nOn November 17, 2005, the board of directors adopted a shareholder protection rights plan which called for the issuance, on November 29, 2005, as a dividend, of rights to acquire fractional shares of preferred stock. The rights are attached to the shares of common stock and transfer with them. In the future the rights may become exchangeable for shares of preferred stock with various provisions that may discourage a takeover bid. Additionally, the rights have what are known as \u201cflip-in\u201d and \u201cflip-over\u201d provisions that could make any acquisition of the company more costly. The principal objective of the plan is to cause someone interested in acquiring the company to negotiate with the board of directors rather than launch an unsolicited bid. This plan may limit, prevent, or discourage a takeover offer that some shareholders may find more advantageous than a negotiated transaction. A negotiated transaction may not be in the best interests of the shareholders.", "PERMNO": 80019, "SIC": 3663, "TIC": "PRKR"}
