{"cik": "1303313", "company": "LHC Group, Inc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe risks and uncertainties described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K could cause our actual results to differ materially from past or expected results and are not the only ones we face. Other risks and uncertainties that we have not predicted or assessed may also adversely affect us.\nIf any of the negative effects associated with the following risks occur, our earnings, financial condition or business could be materially harmed and the trading price of our common stock could decline, resulting in the loss of all or part of stockholders\u2019 investments.\nRisk Factors Related to Reimbursement and Government Regulation\nWe derive a majority of our consolidated net service revenue from Medicare. If there are changes in Medicare rates or methods governing Medicare payments for our services, or if we are unable to control our costs, our results of operations and cash flows could decline materially.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we received 62.1% and 64.1%, respectively, of our net service revenue from Medicare. Reductions in Medicare rates or changes in the way Medicare pays for services could cause our net service revenue and net income to decline, perhaps materially. See Part I, Item 1. Reimbursement in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding reimbursements. Reductions in Medicare reimbursement could be caused by many factors, including:\n\u2022administrative or legislative changes to the base rates under the applicable prospective payment systems,\n\u2022the reduction or elimination of annual rate increases,\n\u2022the imposition or increase by Medicare of mechanisms shifting more responsibility for a portion of payment to beneficiaries, such as co-payments,\n\u2022adjustments to the relative components of the wage index used in determining reimbursement rates,\n\u2022changes to case mix or therapy thresholds,\n\u2022the reclassification of home health resource groups or long-term care diagnosis-related groups, or\n\u2022further limitations on referrals to long-term acute care hospitals from host hospitals.\nWe receive fixed payments from Medicare for our services based on the level of care provided to our patients. Consequently, our profitability largely depends upon our ability to manage the cost of providing these services. We cannot be assured that reimbursement payments under governmental payor programs, including Medicare, will remain at levels comparable to present levels or will be sufficient to cover the costs allocable to patients eligible for reimbursement pursuant to these programs. Any such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Medicare currently provides for an annual adjustment of the various payment rates, such as the base episode rate for our home nursing services, based upon the increase or decrease of the medical care expenditure, which may be less than actual inflation. This adjustment could be eliminated or reduced in any given year.\nAdditionally, while the CARES Act reversed prior reductions in Medicare reimbursement through the 2% sequestration mandated by earlier legislation, we cannot anticipate when that sequestration reimbursement reduction will return. Further, Medicare routinely reclassifies home health resource groups and long-term care diagnosis-related groups. As a result of those reclassifications, we could receive lower reimbursement rates depending on the case mix of the patients we service. If our cost of providing services increases by more than the annual Medicare price adjustment, or if these reclassifications result in lower reimbursement rates, our results of operations, net income and cash flows could be adversely impacted.\nAdditionally, CMS proposed changes to the Home Health Prospective Payment System case-mix adjustment methodology through the use of a new PDGM for home health payments. This change was implemented on January 1, 2020, and also includes a change in the unit of payment from a 60-day payment period to a 30-day payment period and eliminates the use of therapy visits in the determination of payments. While the changes are intended to be implemented in a budget-neutral manner to the industry, the ultimate impact will vary by provider based on factors including patient mix and admission source. Additionally, in arriving at the calculation of a rate that is budget-neutral, CMS has made numerous assumptions about behavioral changes. The application of these assumptions could negatively impact our rates of reimbursement and have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation. Any changes in the laws and regulations governing our business, or the interpretation and enforcement of those laws or regulations, could require us to modify our operations and could negatively impact our operating results and cash flows.\nAs a provider of health care services, we are subject to extensive regulation on the federal, state, and local levels. The laws and regulations governing our operations, along with the terms of participation in various government programs, regulate how\nwe conduct business, the services we offer, and our interactions with patients and other providers. See Part I, Item 1. Government Regulations in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information concerning applicable laws and regulations. These laws and regulations, and their interpretations, are subject to frequent change. Changes in existing laws, regulations, their interpretations or the enactment of new laws or regulations could increase our costs of doing business, disrupt our business practices and cause our net income to decline. If we fail to comply with these applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil or criminal penalties, including the loss of our licenses to operate and our ability to participate in federal and state reimbursement programs. Furthermore, complying with these regulations requires significant compliance related costs.\nWe cannot predict the effect that health care reform and other changes in government programs may have on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nThe laws and regulations governing our operations are subject to constant change as a result of continued healthcare reform. Health care reform and other changes can result in significant costs to us, require us to change our methods of doing business and may be difficult to comply with. While we cannot predict the extent of future health care reform and changing healthcare laws or its impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations, such reform and changes could materially and adversely affect us. We also anticipate that the Biden Administration will pursue healthcare reform that is significantly different than the healthcare reform pursued by the Trump Administration and that such reform may result in additional regulations and compliance costs. Any proposed federal health care reforms could have a meaningful impact on our business.\nIn addition, various health care reform proposals similar to recent federal reforms have also emerged at the state level, including in several states in which we operate. We cannot predict with certainty what health care initiatives, if any, will be implemented at the state level, or what the ultimate effect of state health care reform or any future legislation or regulation may have on us or on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThere are also continuing efforts to reform governmental health care programs that could result in major changes in the health care delivery and reimbursement system on a national and state level, including changes directly impacting the reimbursement systems for our home health and hospice care services. Though we cannot predict what, if any, reform proposals will be adopted, healthcare reform and legislation may have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows through decreasing payments made for our services.\nChanges in our \u201cQuality of Patient Care Star Ratings\u201d could adversely affect our business.\nCMS has instituted a star rating methodology for home health agencies to meet the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act's (\"PPACA\") call for more transparent public information on provider quality. All Medicare-certified home health agencies would be eligible to receive a star rating (from 1 to 5 stars) based on a number of quality measures, such as timely initiation of care, drug education provided to patients, fall risk assessment, depression assessments, improvements in bed transferring, and bathing, among others. The \u201cQuality of Patient Care Star Ratings\u201d were first published in July 2015, and are updated quarterly thereafter based upon new data that is published with the ratings on the \u201cHome Health Compare\u201d section of the medicare.gov website. While we are pleased with the ratings received by our home health agencies and are striving to improve our results, failing to maintain satisfactory star rating scores could affect our rates of reimbursement and have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe face reviews, audits and investigations under our contracts with federal and state government agencies and private payors, and these audits could have adverse findings that may negatively impact our business.\nWe are subject to various routine and non-routine governmental reviews, audits and investigations. CMS engages third party contractors to conduct additional development request (\"ADR\") and other third party firms, including zone program integrity contractors (\"ZPIC\") and recovery audit contractors (\"RAC\"), to conduct extensive reviews of claims data and non-medical and other records to identify potential improper payments under the Medicare program. In recent years, federal and state civil and criminal enforcement agencies have heightened and coordinated their oversight efforts related to the health care industry, including with respect to referral practices, cost reporting, billing practices, joint ventures and other financial relationships among health care providers. Although we have invested substantial time and effort in implementing policies and procedures to comply with laws and regulations, we could be subject to liabilities arising from violations. A violation of the laws governing our operations, or changes in the interpretation of those laws, could result in the imposition of fines, civil or criminal penalties, and the termination of our rights to participate in federal and state-sponsored programs or the suspension or revocation of our licenses to operate. Our costs to respond to and defend reviews, audits, and investigations may be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Moreover, an adverse review, audit, or investigation could result in:\n\u2022required refunding or retroactive adjustment of amounts we have been paid pursuant to the federal or state programs or from private payors,\n\u2022state or federal agencies imposing fines, penalties, and other sanctions on us,\n\u2022loss of our right to participate in the Medicare program, state programs, or one or more private payor networks, or\n\u2022damage to our business and reputation in various markets.\nThese results could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf any of our agencies or facilities fail to comply with the conditions of participation in the Medicare program, that agency or facility could be terminated from Medicare, which could adversely affect our net service revenue and net income.\nOur agencies and facilities must comply with the extensive conditions of participation in the Medicare program. These conditions of participation vary depending on the type of agency or facility, but, in general, require our agencies and facilities to meet specified standards relating to personnel, patient rights, patient care, patient records, administrative reporting, and legal compliance. If an agency or facility fails to meet any of the Medicare conditions of participation, that agency or facility may receive a notice of deficiency from the applicable state surveyor. If that agency or facility then fails to institute a plan of correction to correct the deficiency within the time period provided by the state surveyor, that agency or facility could be terminated from the Medicare program. We respond in the ordinary course to deficiency notices issued by state surveyors and none of our facilities or agencies have ever been terminated from the Medicare program for failure to comply with the conditions of participation. Any termination of one or more of our agencies or facilities from the Medicare program for failure to satisfy the Medicare conditions of participation could materially and adversely affect our net service revenue and net income.\nOur revenue may be negatively impacted by a failure to appropriately document services, resulting in delays in reimbursement.\nReimbursement to us is conditioned upon providing the correct administrative and billing codes and properly documenting the services themselves, including the level of service provided, and the necessity for the services. If incorrect or incomplete documentation is provided or inaccurate reimbursement codes are utilized, this could result in nonpayment for services rendered and could lead to allegations of billing fraud. This could subsequently lead to civil and criminal penalties, including exclusion from government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, third-party payors may disallow, in whole or in part, requests for reimbursement based on determinations that certain amounts are not covered, services provided were not medically necessary, or supporting documentation was not adequate.\nThe inability of our long-term acute care hospitals to maintain their certification as long-term acute care hospitals could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nFollowing the expiration of exemptions provided under the CARES Act, if our LTACHs fail to meet or maintain the standards for Medicare certification as LTACHs, such as for average minimum patient length-of-stay and restrictions on sources of referral (e.g. the 25 Percent rule), they will receive reimbursement under the prospective payment system applicable to general acute care hospitals rather than the system applicable to long-term acute care hospitals. Payments at rates applicable to general acute care hospitals would likely result in our LTACHs receiving less Medicare reimbursement than they currently receive for their patient services. If any of our LTACHs were subject to payment as general acute care hospitals, our net service revenue and net income would decline.\nOur hospice operations are subject to two annual Medicare caps. If any of our hospice providers exceeds such caps, our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nOverall payments made by Medicare to each hospice provider number (generally corresponding to each of our hospice agencies) are subject to an inpatient cap amount and an overall payment cap amount, which are calculated and published by the Medicare fiscal intermediary on an annual basis covering the period from October 1 through September 30. If payments received under any of our hospice provider numbers exceeds either of these caps, we may be required to reimburse Medicare for payments received in excess of the caps, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf the structures or operations of our joint ventures are found to violate the law, it could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations.\nSeveral of our joint ventures are with hospitals and physicians, which are governed by the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and similar state laws. These anti-kickback statutes prohibit the payment or receipt of anything of value in return for referrals of patients or services covered by governmental health care programs, such as Medicare. The OIG has published numerous safe\nharbors that exempt qualifying arrangements from enforcement under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. We have sought to satisfy as many safe harbor requirements as possible in structuring our joint ventures.\nDespite our efforts to meet the safe harbor requirements where possible, our joint ventures may not satisfy all elements of the safe harbor requirements. If any of our joint ventures were found to be in violation of federal or state anti-kickback or physician referral laws, we could be required to restructure them or refuse to accept referrals from the physicians or hospitals with which we have entered into a joint venture. We also could be required to repay to Medicare amounts we have received pursuant to any prohibited referrals, and we could suffer civil or criminal penalties, including the loss of our licenses to operate and our ability to participate in federal and state health care programs. If any of our joint ventures were subject to any of these penalties, our business could be materially adversely affected. If the structure of any of our joint ventures were found to violate federal or state anti-kickback statutes or physician referral laws, we may be unable to implement our growth strategy, which could have an adverse impact on our future net income and consolidated results of operations.\nThe application of state certificate of need and permit of approval regulations and compliance with federal and state licensing requirements could substantially limit our ability to operate and grow our business.\nOur ability to expand operations in a state will depend on our ability to obtain a state license to operate. States may have a limit on the number of licenses they issue. For example, Louisiana currently has a moratorium on the issuance of new home nursing agency licenses. We cannot predict whether the moratorium in Louisiana will be extended. In addition, we cannot predict whether any other states in which we operate, or may wish to operate in the future, may adopt a similar moratorium.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we operated in 16 states that require health care providers to obtain prior approval, known as a certificate of need or a permit of approval, for the purchase, construction, or expansion of health care facilities, to make certain capital expenditures, or to make changes in services or bed capacity. The failure to obtain any requested certificate of need, permit of approval or other license could impair our ability to operate or expand our business.\nQuality reporting requirements may negatively impact Medicare reimbursement.\nMany of our business are subject to reporting requirements that if we fail to comply with may negatively impact future Medicare reimbursement. In particular, the PPACA established quality reporting requirements for hospice programs. Failure to submit required quality data will result in a 2 percentage point reduction to the market basket percentage increase for that fiscal year. The Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation Act of 2014 (the \u201cIMPACT Act\u201d) established requirements for home health agencies and other providers to submit standardized data. Failure to report data as required by the IMPACT ACT will subject providers to a 2% reduction in market basket prices then in effect. Similarly, CMS established a new \u201cPay-for-Reporting Performance Requirement\u201d with which provider compliance with quality reporting program requirements can be measured. Home health agencies that do not submit quality measure data to CMS are subject to a 2% reduction in their annual home health payment update percentage. There can be no assurance that all of our agencies will continue to meet quality reporting requirements in the future which may result in one or more of our agencies seeing a reduction in its Medicare reimbursements. Regardless, these reporting requirements are costly and we, like other healthcare providers, will incur meaningful expenses in an effort to comply with these and future quality reporting requirements.\nRisk Factors Related to Operations and our Growth Strategy\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has materially impacted our business, and will likely continue to impact our business in the future.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted economic activity and conditions worldwide, including work forces, liquidity, capital markets, consumer behavior, supply chains, and macroeconomic conditions, which in turn has materially impacted our business. While we expect the COVID-19 pandemic to continue to impact our business in the near term, the extent and duration of the continued effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and results of operations is unknown and will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and outside our control. These developments include the scope, duration and severity of the pandemic (including the possibility of further surges or variations of COVID-19), the timing and efficacy of the vaccination program in the states and locales in which we operate, further actions taken by governmental authorities, including future stimulus programs, in response to the pandemic and changing consumer and patient behavior. It is also possible that the pandemic and its aftermath will lead to a prolonged economic slowdown or recession in the U.S. economy. We may face interruption in the provision of our services, and increased costs of services, both of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe majority of the Company\u2019s revenues are derived from the provision of home health and hospice services. While demand for our home health services have not been materially impacted by COVID-19 to date, such demand could suffer depending on the duration and severity of the pandemic due to heightened anxiety among our patients regarding the risk of exposure to COVID-19 as a result of home health visits. Additionally, many of our patients are prescribed home health services after discharge from the hospital or after other surgeries and medical procedures. The pandemic has resulted and could continue to\nresult in restrictions on or the avoidance or delay of health care visits and procedures. These and other factors related to COVID-19 could eventually reduce demand for our home health services.\nOur ability to provide services to our patients depends first and foremost on the health and safety of our skilled nurses, home health aides, and therapists. While we continue to take significant precautions to enable our health care providers to continue to safely provide our important services to our patients during the pandemic and while we have not experienced material service interruptions to date during the pandemic, we could experience interruptions in our ability to continue to provide these services in the future. For example, if there is a reduction in our available healthcare providers due to concerns around COVID-19 related risks or if substantial numbers of our healthcare providers were to contract COVID-19 or otherwise be required to quarantine due to exposure to COVID-19, our ability to provide services to our patients may be significantly interrupted or suspended.\nIn addition to a number of factors that could adversely impact demand for our services and our ability to provide services to our patients, we may experience increased cost of care and reduced reimbursements as a result of COVID-19. In particular, we have experienced higher costs due to the higher utilization and cost of personal protective equipment as well as increased purchasing of other medical supplies, cleaning, and sanitization materials. If our patients suffer from increased incidence of and complications from illnesses, including COVID-19, our costs of providing care for our patients would increase. We may also face reduced reimbursement for our services through Medicare and commercial health care plans in the event that such plans do not adjust patient and other qualifications to address changes related to COVID-19. In addition, if our healthcare providers are unable to obtain vaccines in a timely manner or are not willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, demand for our services may be reduced if there is a perception that other service providers would offer less risk than our health care providers.\nIn addition, a number of our employees are continuing to work from home. While we have continued to invest in technology and equipment that allows our remote work force to provide continued and seamless functionality to our clinicians who continue to care for patients on service, remote working may heighten cybersecurity, information security, and operational risks and affect the productivity of our employees.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the scope, severity, and duration of the pandemic, the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact, and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures. The COVID-19 pandemic also may have the effect of heightening the other risk factors disclosed herein.\nWe face competition, including from competitors with greater resources, which may make it difficult for us to compete effectively as a provider of post-acute health care services.\nWe compete with national, regional, and local home nursing and hospice companies, hospitals and other businesses that provide post-acute health care services, some of which are large, established companies that have significantly greater resources than we do. We expect our competitors to develop joint ventures with providers, referral sources, and payors, which could result in increased competition. The introduction by our competitors of new and enhanced service offerings, in combination with industry consolidation and the development of strategic relationships by our competitors, could cause a decline in our net service revenue and loss of market acceptance of our services. Future increases in competition from existing competitors or new entrants may limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share. Additionally, we compete with a number of non-profit organizations that can finance acquisitions and capital expenditures on a tax-exempt basis or receive charitable contributions that are unavailable to us. We may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors and competitive pressures may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nManaged care organizations and other third party payors continue to consolidate, which enhances their ability to influence the delivery of health care services. Consequently, the health care needs of patients in the United States are increasingly served by a smaller number of managed care organizations, and these organizations generally enter into service agreements with a limited number of providers. Our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if these organizations do not contract with us as a provider and/or engage our competitors as a preferred or exclusive providers. In addition, should private payors, including managed care payors, seek to negotiate additional discounted fee structures or the assumption by health care providers of all or a portion of the financial risk through prepaid capitation arrangements, our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to react competitively to new developments, our operating results may suffer. State certificates of need or permit of approval laws often limit the ability of competitors to enter into a given market, are not uniform throughout the United States and are frequently the subject of efforts to limit or repeal such laws. If states remove existing certificates of need\nor permit of approvals, we could face increased competition in these states. There can be no assurances that states will not seek to eliminate or limit their existing certificates of need or permit of approval programs, which could lead to increased competition in these states. Further, we may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nChanges in the case mix of patients, as well as payor mix and payment methodologies, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nThe sources and amounts of our patient revenue are determined by a number of factors, including the mix of patients and the rates of reimbursement among payors. Changes in the case mix of the patients, payment methodologies, or payor mix among private pay, Medicare, and Medicaid may significantly affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nOur failure to negotiate favorable managed care contracts, or adapt to and comply with innovative reimbursement models, or our loss of existing favorable managed care contracts, could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOne of our strategies is to diversify our payor sources by increasing the business we do with managed care companies, and we strive to secure favorable contracts with managed care payors. However, we may not be successful in these efforts and we may not successfully adapt to and comply with increasingly innovative reimbursement models being sought by payors. Additionally, there is a risk that any favorable managed care contracts that we can secure may be terminated on short notice, since managed care contracts typically permit the payor to terminate without cause, typically on 60 days' notice. Such provisions can provide payors with leverage to reduce volume or obtain favorable pricing. Our failure to negotiate, secure, and maintain favorable managed care contracts and our inability to adapt to and comply with innovative reimbursement models could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nShortages in qualified nurses and other health care professionals could increase our operating costs significantly or constrain our ability to grow.\nWe rely on our ability to attract and retain qualified nurses and other health care professionals. The availability of qualified nurses nationwide has declined in recent years and competition for these and other health care professionals has increased, especially under the healthcare and economic crises experienced throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, and, therefore, salary and benefit costs have risen accordingly. Our ability to attract and retain nurses and other health care professionals depends on several factors, including our ability to protect our staff during the COVID-19 pandemic by providing adequate personal protective equipment and provide desirable assignments and competitive benefits and salaries. We may not be able to attract and retain qualified nurses or other health care professionals in the future. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced increased costs to attract and retain qualified skilled nursing and paraprofessional personnel and faced challenges in staffing patient care due to reductions in available work force. If these increased costs of attracting and retaining these professionals and providing them with attractive benefit packages or we are unable to overcome the challenges with workforce availability, our net income could decline. Moreover, if we are unable to attract and retain qualified professionals, the quality of services offered to our patients may decline or our ability to grow may be constrained. In addition, if we expand our operations into geographic areas where health care providers historically have been unionized, or if any of our care center employees become unionized, being subject to a collective bargaining agreement may have a negative impact on our ability to timely and successfully recruit qualified personnel and may increase our operating costs.\nAdditionally, a number of states require that direct care workers, such as our nurses, receive state-mandated minimum wage and/or overtime pay. Opponents of such policies argue that the new protections will make in-home care more expensive for government programs that pay for such services, and that these new rules and regulations could result in a reduction in covered services. We will continue to evaluate the effect of these various new rules and regulations on our operations.\nThe loss of certain Board of Directors, executive management, or key employees could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance.\nOur success depends upon the continued service of our Board of Directors and employment of our executive management team and key employees and our ability to retain and motivate these individuals. If we lose the services of one or more of our Board of Directors, executive officers, or key employees, we may not be able to successfully manage our business, achieve our business goals, or replace them with equally qualified personnel. The loss of any of our executive officers or key employees could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance. Furthermore, while our board has undertaken succession planning there is no guarantee that such succession planning will be successful and any management succession or transition involves inherent risk that could hinder our strategic planning, execution and future performance.\nWe may close additional underperforming agencies in the future.\nWe regularly review the performance of our various agencies. Our review considers the current financial performance, market penetration, forecasted market growth and current and future reimbursement payment forecasts. We will continue to monitor the performance of our agencies on an ongoing basis, and closures may from time to time occur in the future. If we take any further action to close agencies, we will incur additional costs and expenses, which may require us to record significant charges in future periods. While any such closures would be made in connection with our constant efforts to improve our profitability, associated charges would have a negative impact on our revenue and possibly our operating results during the short-term.\nFuture acquisitions may be unsuccessful and could expose us to unforeseen liabilities. Further, our acquisition and internal development activity may impose strains on our existing resources.\nOur growth strategy involves the acquisition of agencies throughout the United States. These acquisitions involve significant risks and uncertainties, including difficulties integrating acquired personnel and other corporate cultures into our business, the potential loss of key employees or patients of acquired agencies, the delay in payments associated with change in ownership, control, and the internal process of the Medicare fiscal intermediary, and the exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired agencies. Additionally, operations that we acquire must be integrated into our various information systems in an efficient and effective manner. If we are unable to integrate and transition any acquired business into our information systems, we could incur unanticipated expenses, suffer disruptions in service, experience regulatory issues, lose revenue from the operation of such business and fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions.\nFurther, the financial benefits we expect to realize from many of our acquisitions are largely dependent upon our ability to improve clinical performance, overcome regulatory deficiencies, and improve the reputation of the acquired business in the community and control costs. We may not be able to fully integrate the operations of the acquired businesses with our current business structure in an efficient and cost-effective manner, having a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, we may be exposed to unforeseen liabilities of an acquired company, which liabilities may not be covered by insurance or indemnification from sellers and may be material.\nIn addition, as we continue to expand our markets, our growth could strain our resources, including management, information and accounting systems, regulatory compliance, logistics, and other internal controls. Our resources may not keep pace with our anticipated growth. If we do not manage our expected growth effectively, our future prospects could be affected adversely.\nWe may face increased competition for attractive acquisition and joint venture candidates.\nWe intend to continue growing through the acquisition of additional home-based and hospice agencies and the formation of joint ventures with hospitals for the operation of home-based and hospice agencies. We face competition for acquisition and joint venture candidates, which may limit the number of acquisition and joint venture opportunities available to us or lead to the payment of higher prices for our acquisitions and joint ventures. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition or joint venture opportunities in the future or that any such opportunities, if identified, will be consummated on favorable terms, if at all. Without successful acquisitions or joint ventures, our future growth rate could decline. In addition, we cannot guarantee that any future acquisitions or joint ventures, if consummated, will result in further growth.\nFederal regulation may impair our ability to consummate acquisitions or open new agencies.\nChanges in federal laws or regulations may materially adversely impact our ability to acquire home nursing agencies or open new start-up home nursing agencies. For example, CMS has adopted a regulation known as the \u201c36 Month Rule\u201d that is applicable to home health agency acquisitions. Subject to certain exceptions, the 36 Month Rule prohibits buyers of certain home health agencies - those that either enrolled in Medicare or underwent a change in ownership fewer than 36 months prior to the acquisitions - from assuming the Medicare billing privileges of the acquired agency. Instead, the acquired home health agencies must enroll as new providers with Medicare. As a result, the 36 Month Rule may further increase competition for acquisition targets that are not subject to the rule, and may cause significant Medicare billing delays for the purchases of home health agencies that are subject to the rule.\nWe have invested in development stage companies which may require further funding to support their respective business plans, which may ultimately prove unsuccessful.\nIn conjunction with the Almost Family Merger, we obtained controlling interests in (a) Imperium Health Management, LLC, an Accountable Care Organization (\"ACO\") enablement and management company, (b) Long Term Solutions, Inc., a provider of in-home nursing assessments for the long-term care insurance industry, and (c) certain assets operated by Advanced Care House Calls, which provides primary medical care for home-bound or home-limited patients with chronic and acute illnesses who have difficulty traveling to a doctor's office. These investments, which make up our HCI segment, are highly speculative, at risk and we may choose to make further investments, all of which may ultimately provide no return and could lead to a total loss of our investment.\nFurthermore, portions of our HCI segment compete in new and developing markets with new competitors or solutions developed and introduced to the market regularly. Such new products may capture market share more quickly or may have access to more capital than the capital we have allocated for such projects. Our efforts to bring new solutions to the market may prove unsuccessful, may prove to be unprofitable, or may prove to be costlier to bring to market than anticipated. Our investments in these activities are highly speculative in nature and subject to loss. Specifically, our assessment subsidiary competes with larger, better capitalized competitors, while also being particularly reliant on a small number of large customers, the loss of which could significantly and adversely impact its results.\nOur HCI segment also primarily provides strategic health management services to ACOs that have been approved to participate in the Medicare Shared Savings Program (\u201cMSSP\u201d). ACO\u2019s and the MSPP are relatively new and are subject to meaningful regulation with various regulators having adopted or considering the adoption of new legislation, rules, regulations and guidance relating to formation and operation of ACOs. Failure to comply with legal or regulatory restrictions may result in CMS terminating the ACO's agreement with CMS and/or subjecting the ACO to loss of the right to engage in some or all business in a state, payments fines or penalties, or may implicate federal and state fraud and abuse laws relating to anti-trust, physician fee-sharing arrangements, anti-kickback prohibitions, prohibited referrals, any of which may adversely affect our HCI segment\u2019s operations and/or profitability.\nFailure of, or problems with, our critical software or information systems could harm our business and operating results.\nWe depend upon reliable and secure information systems to provide valuable tools by which we manage our business, comply with legal requirements, provide services, and bill and collect for our services. In addition to our Service Value Point system, our business is also substantially dependent on non-proprietary software provided by third-party vendors. For example, we utilize third-party software information systems for billing and maintaining patient claim receivables. Our business also depends on a comprehensive payroll and human resources system for basic payroll functions and reporting, payroll tax reporting, managing wage assignments and garnishments. Our business also supports the use of Electronic Visit Verification (\"EVV\") to collect visit submission information through our delivery of home and community-based, and we rely on third-party software vendors to provide continual maintenance, enhancements, as well as security of collected data. To the extent that our EVV vendors fail to support these processes, our internal operations could be negatively affected.\nOur agencies also depend upon our information systems for accounting, billing, collections, risk management, quality assurance, payroll, education tracking, and operational performance. If we experience a reduction in the performance, reliability, availability, or accuracy of our information systems, our operations and financial performance, and ability to report timely and accurate information, could be adversely affected.\nOur systems require constant maintenance, upgrades, and enhancements to preserve system capabilities and security and to meet our operational needs. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect, and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards, and changing customer preferences. Problems with, or the failure of, our information systems or software could negatively impact our clinical performance and our management and reporting capabilities. To the extent third-party software vendors fail to support our licensed software or systems, or if we lose our licenses, our operations could be materially and negatively affected. Any significant problems with or failures of our information systems or software could materially and adversely affect our operations and reputation, result in significant costs to us, cause delays in our ability to bill and collect from Medicare or other payors for our services, or impair our data capture, medical documentation, or ability to provide our services in the future. The costs incurred in correcting any errors or problems with our proprietary and non-proprietary software may be substantial and could adversely affect our net income.\nAdditionally, operations that we acquire must be integrated into our various information systems in an efficient and effective manner. For certain aspects, we rely upon third party contractors to assist us with those activities. If we are unable to integrate and transition any acquired business into our information systems, due to our failures or any failure of our third party contractors, we could incur unanticipated expenses, suffer disruptions in service, experience regulatory issues, and lose revenue from the operation of such business.\nOur information systems are networked via public network infrastructure and standards based encryption tools that meet regulatory requirements for transmission of protected health information over such networks. We have built redundancy into our networks and installed privacy protection systems on our network and POC devices to prevent unauthorized access to proprietary, sensitive, and legally protected information. However, our technology may fail to adequately secure the confidential health information and personally identifiable information we maintain in our databases. Additionally, threats from computer viruses, instability of the public network on which our data transit relies, or other instances that might render those networks unstable or disabled would create operational difficulties for us, including difficulties effectively transmitting claims and maintaining efficient clinical oversight of our patients, as well as disrupting revenue reporting and billing and collections management, which could adversely affect our business or operations. If personal information or protected information of our patients, employees, or others with whom we do business is tampered with, stolen, or otherwise improperly\naccessed, we may incur fines and penalties associated with the breach of security or be required to take other action in response to judicial or regulatory actions arising out of the incident, including under HIPAA or other judicial acts.\nOur information systems are also subject to damage or service interruption due to natural disasters, floods, fires, loss of power, loss of telecommunications connectivity, and other events that may be beyond our immediate control. While we maintain and test various disaster recovery plans and procedures, our failure to successfully implement and execute upon such plans and procedures, and restore the full operational capabilities of our information systems and software in an effective and efficient manner, could have a material adverse effect on the functionality of our information systems and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and cause a possible significant disruption of our operations and services.\nWe develop and maintain portions of our clinical systems in-house. Failure of, or problems with, these systems could harm our business and operating results.\nWe develop and maintain proprietary software systems to collect assessment data, log patient visits, generate medical orders, and monitor treatments and outcomes in accordance with established medical standards. These systems integrate billing and collections functionality as well as accounting, human resource, payroll, and employee benefits programs provided by third parties. Problems with, or the failure of, such technologies and systems could negatively impact data capture, billing, collections, and management and reporting capabilities. Any such problems or failures could adversely affect our operations and reputation, result in significant costs to us, and impair our ability to provide our services in the future. The costs incurred in correcting any errors or problems may be substantial and could adversely affect our profitability.\nOur ability to maintain the security of patient, employee, third-party, or company information could have an impact on our reputation, our financial position, and the results of our operations.\nWe have been, and likely will continue to be, subject to attempts of computer hacking, vandalism and theft, malware, computer viruses, ransomware, and other malicious codes, phishing, employee error and malfeasance, catastrophes, unforeseen events, or other cyber-attacks. To date, we have seen no material impact on our business or operations from these attacks or events. Any future significant compromise or breach of our data security, whether external or internal, or misuse of patient, employee, third-party or Company data, could result in significant costs, lost sales, fines, lawsuits, and damage to our reputation. The proliferation of ever-evolving threats mean that we and our third-party service providers and vendors must continually evaluate and adapt our respective systems and processes and overall security environment, as well as those of any operations we acquire, and incur significant expenses on such security measures. There is no guarantee that these measures will be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches, system compromises, or misuses of data.\nA cybersecurity or ransomware attack or other incident that affects our information systems security could cause a security breach that may lead to a material disruption to our information systems infrastructure or business and may involve a significant loss of business or patient health information. If a cybersecurity attack or other unauthorized attempt to access our systems or facilities were to be successful, it could result in the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of confidential information or intellectual property, and could cause operational or business delays that may materially impact our ability to provide various healthcare services. Any successful cybersecurity attack or other unauthorized attempt to access our systems or facilities also could result in negative publicity which could damage our reputation or brand with our patients, referral sources, payors, or other third parties and could subject us to substantial sanctions, fines, and damages and other additional civil and criminal penalties under HIPAA, HITECH, the Omnibus Rule and other federal and state privacy laws, in addition to litigation with those affected.\nWhile we provide our employees with training and regular reminders on important measures they can take to prevent breaches or phishing schemes, given the rapidly evolving nature and proliferation of cyber threats, there can be no assurance our training and network security measures or other controls will detect, prevent, or remediate security or data breaches in a timely manner or otherwise prevent unauthorized access to, damage to, or interruption of our systems and operations.\nWe may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches, including unauthorized access to patient data and personally identifiable information stored in our information systems, and the introduction of computer viruses or other malicious software programs to our systems, and cyber-attacks, email phishing schemes, malware, and ransomware. Moreover, a security breach, or threat thereof, could require that we expend significant resources to repair or improve our information systems and infrastructure and could distract management and other key personnel from performing their primary operational duties. In the case of a material breach or cyber-attack, the associated expenses and losses may exceed our current insurance coverage for such events. Some adverse consequences are not insurable, such as reputational harm and third-party business interruption. Failure to maintain proper function, security, or availability of our information systems or protect our data against unauthorized access could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIf we are subject to substantial malpractice or other similar claims, it could materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe services we offer have an inherent risk of professional liability and substantial damage awards. At December 31, 2020, we have approximately 30,000 employees. In addition, we employ direct care workers on a contractual basis to support our existing workforce. We, and the nurses and other health care professionals who provide services on our behalf, may be the subject of medical malpractice claims. These nurses and other health care professionals could be considered our agents and, as a result, we could be held liable for their medical negligence. We cannot predict the effect that any claims of this nature, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could have on our business or reputation or on our ability to attract and retain patients and employees. We maintain malpractice liability insurance that provides primary coverage on a claims-made basis of $1.0 million per incident and $3.0 million in annual aggregate amounts. In addition, we maintain multiple layers of umbrella coverage in the aggregate amount of $40.0 million that provide excess coverage for professional malpractice and other liabilities. We are responsible for deductibles and amounts in excess of the limits of our coverage. Claims that could be made in the future in excess of the limits of such insurance, if successful, could materially adversely affect our financial condition. In addition, our insurance coverage may not continue to be available to us at commercially reasonable rates, in adequate amounts or on satisfactory terms.\nRisk Factors Related to Capital and Liquidity\nDelays in reimbursement may cause liquidity problems.\nOur business is characterized by delays in reimbursement, from the time we request payment for our services to the time we receive reimbursement or payment. Beginning in 2021, we can no longer bill for and receive a portion of our estimated reimbursement at the commencement of the 30-day billing period. Instead, we are required to bill for and collect the entirety of our services upon completion of the 30-day billing period, and we expect to be paid within 14 to 17 days from the billing date. If we have information system problems or issues arise with Medicare or other payors, we may encounter further delays in our payment cycle. For example, in the past we have experienced delays resulting from problems arising out of the implementation by Medicare of new or modified reimbursement methodologies or as a result of natural disasters, such as hurricanes. We have also experienced delays in reimbursement resulting from our implementation of new information systems related to our accounts receivable and billing functions.\nIn addition, timing delays in billings and collections may cause working capital shortages. Working capital management, including prompt and diligent billing and collection, is an important factor in achieving our financial results and maintaining liquidity. It is possible that documentation support, system problems, Medicare, state Medicaid, or other payor issues, or industry trends may extend our collection period, which may materially adversely affect our working capital, and our working capital management procedures may not successfully mitigate this risk.\nOur implicit price concessions may not be sufficient to cover uncollectible amounts.\nOn an ongoing basis, we review historical net cash realization for Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance revenue that we will not be able to collect. This allows us to calculate the expected loss on our revenue for the period we are reporting. Our implicit price concessions may underestimate actual uncollectible revenue for various reasons, including:\n\u2022adverse changes in our estimates as a result of changes in related collection rates,\n\u2022inability to collect funds due to missed filing deadlines or inability to prove that timely filings were made,\n\u2022adverse changes in the economy generally exceeding our expectations, or\n\u2022unanticipated changes in reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance companies.\nIf our implicit price concessions are insufficient to cover losses on our revenue, our business, financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nThe condition of the financial markets, including volatility and weakness in the equity, capital, and credit markets, could limit the availability and terms of debt and equity financing sources to fund the capital and liquidity requirements of our business.\nFinancial markets may experience significant disruptions, which could impact liquidity in the debt markets, making financing terms for borrowers less attractive and, in certain cases, significantly reducing the availability of certain types of debt financing. While we have not experienced any individual lender limitations to extend credit under our revolving credit facility, the obligations of each of the lending institutions in our revolving credit facility are independent and the availability of future borrowings under our revolving credit facility could be impacted by further volatility and disruptions in the financial credit markets or other events. Our inability to access our revolving credit facility or refinance the revolving credit facility would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nBased on our current plan of operations, including acquisitions, we believe our existing cash balance, when combined with expected cash flows from operations and amounts available under our revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to fund our growth strategy and to meet our anticipated operating expenses, capital expenditures, and debt service obligations for at least the next 12 months. If our future net service revenue or cash flow from operations is less than we currently anticipate, we may not have sufficient funds to implement our growth strategy. Further, we cannot readily predict the timing, size, and success of\nour acquisition and internal development efforts and the associated capital commitments. If we do not have sufficient cash resources, our growth could be limited unless we are able to obtain additional equity or debt financing.\nThe agreement governing our revolving credit facility contains, and future debt agreements may contain, various covenants that limit our discretion in the operation of our business.\nThe agreement and instruments governing our revolving credit facility contain, and the agreements and instruments governing future debt agreements may contain various restrictive covenants that, among other things, require us to seek consent or comply with or maintain certain financial tests and ratios in order to:\n\u2022incur more debt,\n\u2022redeem or repurchase stock, pay dividends or make other distributions,\n\u2022make certain investments,\n\u2022create liens,\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates,\n\u2022make unapproved acquisitions,\n\u2022enter into joint ventures,\n\u2022merge or consolidate,\n\u2022transfer or sell assets, and/or\n\u2022make fundamental changes in our corporate existence and principal business.\nIn addition, events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with and maintain such financial tests and ratios. Any failure by us to comply with or maintain all applicable financial tests and ratios and to comply with all applicable covenants could result in an event of default with respect to our revolving credit facility or any other future debt agreements. An event of default could lead to the acceleration of the maturity of any outstanding loans and the termination of the commitments to make further extensions of credit. Even if we are able to comply with all applicable covenants, the restrictions on our ability to operate our business at our sole discretion could harm our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, mergers, acquisitions and other corporate opportunities.\nIf we are required to either repurchase or sell a substantial portion of the equity interests in our joint ventures, our capital resources and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted.\nUpon the occurrence of fundamental changes to the laws and regulations applicable to our joint ventures, or if a substantial number of our joint venture partners were to exercise the buy/sell provisions contained in many of our joint venture agreements, we may be obligated to purchase or sell the equity interests held by us or our joint venture partners. In some instances, the purchase price under these buy/sell provisions is based on a multiple of the historical or future earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization of the equity joint venture at the time the buy/sell option is exercised. In other instances, the buy/sell purchase price will be negotiated by the joint ventures partners but will be subject to a fair market valuation process. In the event the buy/sell provisions are exercised and we lack sufficient capital to purchase the interest of our joint venture partners, we may be obligated to sell our equity interest in these joint ventures. If we are forced to sell our equity interest, we will lose the benefit of those particular joint venture operations. If these buy/sell provisions are exercised and we choose to purchase the interest of our joint venture partners, we may be obligated to expend significant capital in order to complete such acquisitions. If either of these events occurs, our net service revenue and net income could decline or we may not have sufficient capital necessary to implement our growth strategy.\nWe could be required to record a material non-cash charge to income if our recorded goodwill or intangible assets are impaired.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $1.6 billion of goodwill and intangible assets. We review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment. The goodwill assessment includes comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to the carrying value of the reporting unit. If we determine that the estimated fair value of our goodwill or intangible assets is less than the applicable book value or carrying value, we could be required to record a non-cash impairment charge to our consolidated statements of operations. Because goodwill and intangible assets represent a significant portion of the assets reflected on our consolidated balance sheets, any future impairment of these assets could result in a non-cash charge to our consolidated statements of operations and have a material adverse effect on our earnings, debt covenants, and ability to access capital.\nRisk Factors Related to General Economic and Market Conditions\nCurrent economic conditions and continued decline in spending by the federal and state governments could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nWhile our services are not typically sensitive to general declines in the federal and state economies, the erosion in the tax base caused by a general economic downturn has caused, and will likely cause, restrictions on the federal and state governments\u2019 abilities to obtain financing and a decline in spending. As a result, we may face reimbursement rate cuts or reimbursement delays from Medicare and Medicaid and other governmental payors, which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nAdverse developments in the United States could lead to a reduction in federal government expenditures, including governmentally funded programs in which we participate, such as Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, if at any time the federal government is not able to meet its debt payments unless the federal debt ceiling is raised, and legislation increasing the debt ceiling is not enacted, the federal government may stop or delay making payments on its obligations, including funding for government programs in which we participate, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Failure of the government to make payments under these programs could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, any failure by the United States Congress to complete the federal budget process and fund government operations may result in a federal government shutdown, potentially causing us to incur substantial costs without reimbursement under the Medicare program, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Historically, state budget pressures have resulted in reductions in state spending. Given that Medicaid outlays are a significant component of state budgets, we can expect continuing cost containment pressures on Medicaid outlays for our services.\nWe may be more vulnerable to the effects of a public health catastrophe than other businesses due to the nature of our patients.\nThe majority of our patients are older individuals and others with complex medical challenges, many of whom may be more vulnerable than the general public during a pandemic or other public health catastrophe. Our employees are also at greater risk of contracting contagious diseases due to their increased exposure to vulnerable patients. For example, in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, we suffered losses to our consumer population and faced reductions in the availability of our clinical and para-professional employees. Additionally, we incurred higher than expected labor costs for existing staff and were required to hire replacements for affected workers at higher costs. Accordingly, the occurrence of certain public health catastrophes, including an extended continuation of the current COVID-19 pandemic, could cause material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nHurricanes or other adverse weather events could negatively affect the local economies in which we operate or disrupt our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nOur operations along coastal areas in the United States are particularly susceptible to adverse weather events, such as hurricanes and flooding. Adverse weather events could disrupt our business and results of operations, result in damage to our properties, and negatively affect the local economies in which we operate. Furthermore, climate change may increase the frequency and severity of such adverse weather events. Although we maintain insurance coverage, we cannot guarantee that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover any losses or that we will be able to maintain insurance at a reasonable cost in the future. If our losses from business interruption or property damage exceed the amount for which we are insured, our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nCertain provisions of our charter, bylaws, and Delaware law may delay or prevent a change in control of the Company.\nDelaware law and our governing documents contain provisions that may enable our Board of Directors to resist a change in control of us. These provisions include:\n\u2022staggered terms for our Board of Directors,\n\u2022limitations on persons authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders,\n\u2022the authorization of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval,\n\u2022no cumulative voting for directors,\n\u2022director vacancies are filled by remaining directors (including vacancies resulting from removal), and\n\u2022advance notice procedures required for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring\nmatters before an annual meeting of stockholders.\nThese anti-takeover defenses could discourage, delay, or prevent a transaction to acquire us and may permit our Board of Directors to choose not to entertain offers to purchase us, even if such offers include a substantial premium to the market price of our stock. Therefore, our stockholders may be deprived of opportunities to profit from a sale of control. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors or cause us to take other corporate actions.", "PERMNO": 90734, "SIC": 8082, "TIC": "LHCG"}
