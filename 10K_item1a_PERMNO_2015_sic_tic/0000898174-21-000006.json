{"cik": "898174", "company": "REINSURANCE GROUP OF AMERICA INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn the Risk Factors below, we refer to the Company as \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d or \u201cour.\u201d Investing in our securities involves certain risks. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. These risks are not exclusive, and additional risks to which we are subject include, but are not limited to, the factors mentioned under \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in Item 7 below and the risks of our businesses described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Many of these risks are interrelated and occur under similar business and economic conditions, and the occurrence of certain of them may in turn cause the emergence, or exacerbate the effect, of others. Such a combination could materially increase the severity of the impact on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to COVID-19\nOur business, results of operations and financial condition have been, and will likely continue to be, adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the response thereto.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has increased mortality rates in certain jurisdictions and populations. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic and the response thereto has caused significant disruption in the international and U.S. economies and financial markets and has severely impacted, and will likely continue to severely impact, global economic conditions, resulting in substantial volatility in the global financial markets, increased unemployment and operational challenges such as the temporary closures of businesses, sheltering-in-place directives and increased remote work protocols. Governments and central banks around the world have reacted to the economic crisis caused by the pandemic by implementing stimulus and liquidity programs and cutting interest rates and are considering taking similar additional actions, though it is unclear whether any of these actions will be successful in countering the economic disruption. Depending on the length of the pandemic, the availability, effectiveness and use of treatments and vaccines, and the extent and success of actions by governments and central banks, the adverse mortality rates and impact on the global economy may deepen, and our results of operations and financial condition in future quarters will continue to be adversely affected. The COVID-19 pandemic and the response thereto has adversely affected, and/or will likely adversely affect, us in the following areas:\nInsurance risks, including mortality and morbidity claims. At this time, we cannot predict the ultimate number of claims and financial impact resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and the response thereto. Actual claims and financial impact from these events could vary materially from current estimates due to several factors, including the inherent uncertainties in making such determinations and the evolving nature of the pandemic and the availability, effectiveness and use of treatments and vaccines. Furthermore, the long-term health consequences for individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 and the related impact, if any, on mortality and morbidity are all unknown. Mortality or morbidity experience that is less favorable than the assumptions used in pricing our reinsurance agreements, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, has negatively impacted and in the future could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, increased economic uncertainty and increased unemployment resulting from the economic impacts of the pandemic may result in policyholders seeking sources of liquidity and withdrawing at rates greater than previously expected. If policyholder lapse and surrender rates significantly exceed expectations, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nDegradation of general economic conditions. The COVID-19 pandemic and the extraordinary measures put in place to address it have caused significant economic and financial turmoil both in the U.S. and around the world. These conditions are expected to continue in the near term and may worsen. Our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and statutory capital position are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and economy generally. Depending on the length of the pandemic, the availability, effectiveness and use of treatments and vaccines, and the extent and success of actions by governments and central banks to counter the economic disruption, the adverse impact on the global economy may deepen, and our business, results of operations and financial condition will continue to be adversely affected.\nInvestment results. Our investment portfolio (and, specifically, the valuations of investment assets we hold) has been, and may continue to be, adversely affected as a result of market developments from the COVID-19 pandemic and uncertainty regarding its outcome and related impacts on the economy. Moreover, changes in interest rates, reduced liquidity in the financial markets or a continued slowdown in U.S. or global economic conditions have and in the future may also adversely affect the values and cash flows of these assets. Our corporate fixed income portfolio has been and in the future may be adversely impacted by delayed principal or interest payments, ratings downgrades, increased bankruptcies and credit spread widening in distressed industries and individual companies. Our investments in mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities have been and in the future could be negatively affected by delays or failures of borrowers to make payments of principal and interest when due or delays or moratoriums on foreclosures or enforcement actions with respect to delinquent or defaulted mortgages. Further, a continued low interest rate environment, including as a result of market developments from the COVID-19 pandemic and the response thereto, would continue to put downward pressure on the average yield earned on our investments, negatively impacting our investment income and results of operations in the future. Market dislocations,\ndecreases in observable market activity or unavailability of information, in each case, arising from the pandemic, may restrict our access to key inputs used to derive certain estimates and assumptions made in connection with financial reporting or otherwise, including estimates and changes in long term macro-economic assumptions relating to accounting for current expected credit losses, more commonly referred to as \u201cCECL.\u201d\nCapital, liquidity and collateral. The severe impact on global economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the response thereto has negatively impacted and in the future could negatively impact our financial condition, including possible constraints on our capital and liquidity, as well as a higher cost of capital and possible changes or downgrades to our credit ratings. The current disruptions, uncertainty and volatility in the capital and credit markets may limit our access to capital, and limit the availability of collateral, required to operate our business, most significantly our reinsurance operations. The availability of collateral and the related cost of such collateral affects the type and volume of business we reinsure and could increase our costs.\nPossible ratings downgrade. A downgrade in our ratings or in the ratings of our reinsurance subsidiaries, whether caused by company-specific factors or factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic, general economic conditions and/or the insurance industry could adversely affect us. A downgrade in the rating of RGA or any of our rated subsidiaries could increase our cost of capital and adversely affect our ability to raise capital to facilitate operations and growth. Upon certain downgrade events, some of our reinsurance contracts would either permit our client ceding insurers to terminate such reinsurance contracts or require us to post collateral to secure our obligations under these reinsurance contracts, either of which could negatively impact our ability to conduct business and our results of operations. Any downgrade in the ratings of our reinsurance subsidiaries could also adversely affect their ability to sell products, retain existing business and compete for attractive acquisition opportunities. Actions taken by ratings agencies, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the response thereto and the significant economic and financial turmoil caused thereby, may result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAdverse legislative or regulatory action. Government actions, both in the U.S. and internationally, to address and contain the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect us. Such actions could result in additional regulation or restrictions affecting the conduct of our business in the future. For example, our clients may be subject to legislative and regulatory action that impacts their ability to collect premiums or cancel policies, which may affect our clients\u2019 performance under reinsurance agreements with us. It is also possible that changes in economic conditions and steps taken by governments in response to COVID-19 could require an increase in taxes, which would adversely impact our results of operations.\nPremiums and other income. We expect the impact of COVID-19 on general economic activity to negatively impact our premiums, fee income and market-related revenues. The pandemic and government directives around the world responding thereto has negatively impacted and in the future may further negatively impact our ability to generate new business premiums and may delay our planned entry into, or expansion of, investments in new and emerging markets.\nOperations. We are taking precautions to protect the safety and well-being of our employees, service providers and clients. However, no assurance can be given that the steps being taken will be adequate or appropriate. Our operations could be disrupted if key members of our senior management or a significant percentage of our workforce, or the workforce of our service providers or clients, are unable to continue to work because of illness, government directives or otherwise. Having shifted to remote work arrangements, we may experience reductions in our operating effectiveness and face increased operational risk, including but not limited to cybersecurity attacks or data security incidents. In addition, we rely on the performance of others, including our insurance company clients, retrocessionaires and service providers, and their failure to perform in a satisfactory manner as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the response thereto could negatively affect our operations\nAs a result of the above risks, COVID-19 and the response thereto could continue to materially and adversely impact our business, results of operation and financial condition. The extent to which COVID-19, and the related global economic crisis, will affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition, and capital and liquidity over time, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and any recovery period, the availability, effectiveness and use of treatments and vaccines, future actions taken by governmental authorities, central banks and other third parties in response to the pandemic, and the effects on our clients, counterparties, employees and third-party service providers. Moreover, the effects of COVID-19 and the response thereto will heighten the other risks described below and in any subsequent Quarterly Report on Form-10Q or Current Report on Form 8-K.\nWe utilize assumptions, estimates and models to evaluate the potential impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the response thereto. If actual events differ materially from those assumptions, estimates or models, our potential exposure to mortality claims and investment portfolio losses could be materially higher than those reflected in our capital plans, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe utilize assumptions, estimates and models to evaluate the potential impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition as a result of COVID-19 and the response thereto, including developing scenarios to evaluate our potential exposure to mortality claims, potential investment portfolio losses and other risks associated with our assets and liabilities. The scenarios and related analyses are subject to various assumptions, professional judgment, uncertainties and the inherent limitations of any statistical analysis, including the use and quality of historical internal and industry data. Consequently, actual losses may differ materially from what the scenarios may illustrate. This potential difference could be even greater for events with limited or no modeled annual frequency, such as COVID-19 and the response thereto.\nMore specifically, we evaluate our potential exposure to mortality claims by developing a range of scenarios involving assumptions and estimates relating to a number of variables, such as country-specific circumstances, measures by public and private institutions, impacts of COVID-19 on all other causes of death, the development and timing of effective treatments for COVID-19 and the effectiveness and adoption of vaccines for COVID-19, comorbidities, number of deaths by region or country (and the variability thereof), the duration and pattern of the pandemic, geography-specific institutional and individual mitigation efforts, medical capacity, and other factors. We also estimated adjustments to reflect, among other factors, the favorable age distribution of our insured population and the better health profile and socio-economic status of insured lives as compared to the general population. However, a number of other factors have not been considered, such as smoking status, residential population density, geography-specific testing and interventions and their effectiveness or geography, culture or other country-specific factors. Further, the scenarios do not consider impacts on morbidity claims. Each assumption, estimate or risk not included in the scenarios introduces uncertainty. We also evaluate potential losses from our investment portfolio due to the pandemic based on stress scenarios based on assumptions and estimates relating to a range of factors that are subject to significant uncertainties, including, among others, the magnitude and duration of the economic downturn, ratings downgrades, bankruptcies and credit spread widening. In addition, we may not achieve the earnings generation that we expect, and we may not be able to issue additional debt or access other capital management tools on terms satisfactory to us, or at all. Actual events may differ materially from those assumptions and estimates; consequently, we could incur losses exceeding those reflected in our scenarios and related analysis, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe are operating in an unprecedented period of uncertainty, and while we are attempting to evaluate how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting general population deaths, whether specifically attributed to COVID-19 or otherwise, and how such deaths will translate into mortality claims for our business over time, we are unable to predict the number of COVID-19 deaths that will ultimately occur worldwide, in any particular geography or in our insured population, or potential losses in our investment portfolio. Further, we do not currently have enough information to ascertain the likelihood of the assumptions or estimates related to our mortality and investment loss scenarios. Accordingly, any of our scenarios do not represent forecasts or projections of actual future events or performance. They should not be construed as financial guidance, and should not be relied on as such.\nAs a result of the factors, uncertainties and contingencies described above, our reliance on assumptions, estimates and data used to evaluate our potential exposure to mortality claims and potential losses from our investment portfolio related to the COVID-19 pandemic are subject to a high degree of uncertainty that could result in actual losses that are materially different from those reflected in the scenarios used to develop our capital plans, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe make assumptions when pricing our products relating to mortality, morbidity, lapsation, investment returns and expenses, and significant deviations in experience could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur life reinsurance contracts expose us to mortality, morbidity and lapse risk. Our risk analysis and underwriting processes are designed with the objective of controlling the quality of the business and establishing appropriate pricing for the risks we assume. Among other things, these processes rely heavily on our underwriting, our analysis of mortality, longevity and morbidity trends, lapse rates, expenses and our understanding of medical impairments and their effect on mortality, longevity or morbidity.\nWe expect mortality, longevity, morbidity and lapse experience to fluctuate somewhat from period to period, but believe they should remain reasonably predictable over a period of many years. Mortality, longevity, morbidity or lapse experience that is less favorable than the rates that we used in pricing a reinsurance agreement may cause our net income to be less than otherwise expected because the premiums we receive for the risks we assume may not be sufficient to cover the claims and profit margin. Furthermore, even if the total benefits paid over the life of the contract do not exceed the expected amount, unexpected increases in the incidence of deaths or illness can cause us to pay more benefits in a given reporting period than expected, adversely affecting our net income in any particular reporting period. Likewise, adverse experience could impair our ability to offset certain unamortized deferred acquisition costs and adversely affect our net income in any particular reporting period. We perform annual tests to establish that deferred policy acquisition costs remain recoverable at all times. These tests\nrequire us to make a significant number of assumptions. If our financial performance significantly deteriorates to the point where a premium deficiency exists, a cumulative charge to current operations will be recorded, which may adversely affect our net income in a particular reporting period.\nWe regularly review our reserves and associated assumptions as part of our ongoing assessment of our business performance and risks. If we conclude that our reserves are insufficient to cover actual or expected policy and contract benefits and claim payments as a result of changes in experience, assumptions or otherwise, we would be required to increase our reserves and incur charges in the period in which we make the determination. The amounts of such increases may be significant and this could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and may require us to generate or fund additional capital in our businesses.\nOur financial condition and results of operations may also be adversely affected if our actual investment returns and expenses differ from our pricing and reserve assumptions. Changes in economic conditions may lead to changes in market interest rates or changes in our investment strategies, either of which could cause our actual investment returns and expenses to differ from our pricing and reserve assumptions.\nChanges in accounting standards may adversely affect our reported results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP. If we are required to adopt revised accounting standards in the future, it may adversely affect our reported results of operations and financial condition. For a discussion of the impact of accounting pronouncements issued but not yet implemented, see \u201dNew Accounting Pronouncements\u201d in Note 2 - \u201cSignificant Accounting Principles and Pronouncements\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued guidance that will significantly change the accounting for long-duration insurance contracts. This guidance will become effective for the Company on January 1, 2023. We are still evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements, but it could negatively impact our reported profitability, financial position and financial ratios. In addition, the required adoption of new accounting standards may result in significant incremental costs associated with initial implementation and ongoing compliance.\nOur reinsurance subsidiaries are highly regulated, and changes in these regulations could negatively affect our business.\nOur reinsurance subsidiaries are subject to government regulation in each of the jurisdictions in which they are licensed or authorized to do business. Governmental agencies have broad administrative power to regulate many aspects of the reinsurance business, which may include reinsurance terms and capital adequacy. These agencies are concerned primarily with the protection of policyholders and their direct insurers rather than shareholders or holders of debt securities of reinsurance companies. Moreover, insurance laws and regulations, among other things, establish minimum capital requirements and limit the amount of dividends, tax distributions and other payments our reinsurance subsidiaries can make without prior regulatory approval, and impose restrictions on the amount and type of investments we may hold.\nWe operate in the United States and in many jurisdictions around the world. We are subject to the laws and insurance regulations of the United States. Additionally, a substantial portion of our operations occur outside of the U.S. These international businesses are subject to the insurance, tax and other laws and regulations in the countries in which they are organized and in which they operate. These laws and regulations may apply heightened scrutiny to non-domestic companies, which can adversely affect our operations, liquidity, profitability and regulatory capital. Foreign governments and regulatory bodies from time to time consider legislation and regulations that could subject us to new or different requirements and such changes could negatively impact our operations in the relevant jurisdictions. See \u201cItem 1. Business - B. Corporate Structure - Regulation\u201d for a summary of certain U.S. state and federal laws and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our business. Our failure to comply with these and other laws and regulations could subject us to penalties from governmental or self-regulatory authorities, costs associated with remedying any such failure or related claims, harm to our business relationships and reputation, or interrupt our operations, any of which could negatively impact our financial position and results of operations.\nA downgrade in our ratings or in the ratings of our reinsurance subsidiaries could adversely affect our ability to compete.\nOur financial strength and credit ratings are important factors in our competitive position. Rating organizations periodically review the financial performance and condition of insurers, including our reinsurance subsidiaries. These ratings are based on an insurance company\u2019s ability to pay its obligations and are not directed toward the protection of investors. Rating organizations assign ratings based upon several factors. While most of the factors considered relate to the rated company, some of the factors relate to general economic conditions and circumstances outside the rated company\u2019s control. The various rating agencies periodically review and evaluate our capital adequacy in accordance with their established guidelines and capital models. In order to maintain our existing ratings, we may commit from time to time to manage our capital at levels commensurate with such guidelines and models. If our capital levels are insufficient to fulfill any such commitments, we could be required to reduce our risk profile by, for example, retroceding some of our business or by raising additional capital by\nissuing debt, hybrid or equity securities. Any such actions could have a material adverse impact on our earnings and financial condition or materially dilute our shareholders\u2019 equity ownership interests.\nAny downgrade in the ratings of our reinsurance subsidiaries could adversely affect their ability to sell products, retain existing business, and compete for attractive acquisition opportunities. The ability of our subsidiaries to write reinsurance is influenced by their ratings. Ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. A rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\nWe believe that the rating agencies consider the financial strength and flexibility of a parent company and its consolidated operations when assigning a rating to a particular subsidiary of that company. A downgrade in the rating or outlook of RGA, among other factors, could adversely affect our ability to raise and then contribute capital to our subsidiaries for the purpose of facilitating their operations and growth. A downgrade could also increase our own cost of capital. For example, the facility fee and interest rate for our syndicated revolving credit facility are based on our senior long-term debt ratings. A decrease in those ratings could result in an increase in costs for that credit facility and others. Also, if there is a downgrade in the rating of RGA, or any of our rated subsidiaries, some of our reinsurance contracts would either permit our client ceding insurers to terminate such reinsurance contracts or require us to post collateral to secure our obligations under these reinsurance contracts. Accordingly, we believe a ratings downgrade of RGA, or any of our rated subsidiaries, could negatively impact our ability to conduct business.\nWe cannot assure you that actions taken by ratings agencies would not result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, it is unclear what effect, if any, a ratings change would have on the price of our securities in the secondary market.\nThe availability and cost of collateral, including letters of credit, asset trusts and other credit facilities, as well as regulatory changes relating to the use of captive insurance companies, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRegulatory reserve requirements in various jurisdictions in which we operate may be significantly higher than the reserves required under GAAP. Accordingly, we reinsure, or retrocede, business to affiliated and unaffiliated reinsurers to reduce the amount of regulatory reserves and capital we are required to hold in certain jurisdictions.\nAs described in \u201cItem 1. Business - B. Corporate Structure - Regulation - U.S. Regulation\u201d, Regulation XXX and principles-based reserves (commonly referred to as PBR) requires U.S. life insurance companies to hold a relatively high level of regulatory reserves on their financial statements for various types of life insurance business. Based on the assumed growth rate in our current business plan and the increased level of regulatory reserves associated with some of this business, we expect the amount of our required regulatory reserves and our need to finance these reserves may continue to grow. Changes in laws and regulations and our ability to retrocede certain business may impact our reserving requirements and thus our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a general matter, for us to reduce regulatory reserves on business that we retrocede, the affiliated or unaffiliated reinsurer must provide an equal amount of regulatory-compliant collateral. The availability of collateral and the related cost of such collateral in the future could affect the type and volume of business we reinsure and could increase our costs. We may need to raise additional capital to support higher regulatory reserves, which could increase our overall cost of capital. If we, or our retrocessionaires, are unable to obtain or provide sufficient collateral to support our statutory ceded reserves, we may be required to increase regulatory reserves. In turn, this reserve increase could significantly reduce our statutory capital levels and adversely affect our ability to satisfy required regulatory capital levels, unless we are able to raise additional capital to contribute to our operating subsidiaries. Furthermore, term life insurance is a particularly price-sensitive product, and any increase in insurance premiums charged on these products by life insurance companies, in order to compensate them for the increased statutory reserve requirements or higher costs of insurance they face, may result in a significant loss of volume in their life insurance operations, which could, in turn, adversely affect our life reinsurance operations. We cannot assure you that we will be able to implement actions to mitigate the effect of increasing regulatory reserve requirements.\nIn addition, we maintain credit and letter of credit facilities with various financial institutions as a potential source of collateral and excess liquidity. Our ability to utilize these facilities is conditioned on our satisfaction of covenants and other requirements contained in the facilities. Our ability to utilize these facilities is also subject to the continued willingness and ability of the lenders to provide funds or issue letters of credit. Our failure to comply with the covenants in these facilities, or the failure of the lenders to meet their commitments, would restrict our ability to access these facilities when needed, adversely affecting our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in the equity markets, interest rates and volatility affect the profitability of variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits that we reinsure, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability.\nWe reinsure variable annuity products that include guaranteed minimum living benefits. These include guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits, guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits and guaranteed minimum income benefits. The amount of reserves related to these benefits is based on their fair value and is affected by changes in equity markets, interest rates and volatility. Accordingly, strong equity markets, increases in interest rates and decreases in volatility will generally decrease the fair value of the liabilities underlying the benefits.\nConversely, a decrease in the equity markets along with a decrease in interest rates and an increase in volatility will generally result in an increase in the fair value of the liabilities underlying the benefits, which increases the amount of reserves that we must carry. Such an increase in reserves would result in a charge to our earnings in the quarter in which we increase our reserves. We maintain a customized dynamic hedging program that is designed to mitigate the risks associated with income volatility around the change in reserves on guaranteed benefits. However, hedge positions may not be effective to fully offset changes in the carrying value of the guarantees due to, among other things, the time lag between changes in such values and corresponding changes in the hedge positions, high levels of volatility in the equity and derivatives markets, extreme swings in interest rates, unexpected contract holder behavior, and divergence between the performance of the underlying funds and hedging indices. These factors, individually or collectively, may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, capital levels, financial condition or results of operations.\nRGA is an insurance holding company, and our ability to pay principal, interest and dividends on securities is limited.\nRGA is an insurance holding company, with our principal assets consisting of the stock of our reinsurance company subsidiaries, and substantially all of our income is derived from those subsidiaries. Our ability to pay principal and interest on any debt securities or dividends on any preferred or common stock depends, in part, on the ability of our reinsurance company subsidiaries, our principal sources of cash flow, to declare and distribute dividends or advance money to RGA. We are not permitted to pay common stock dividends or make payments of interest or principal on securities that rank equal or junior to our subordinated debentures and junior subordinated debentures, until we pay any accrued and unpaid interest on such debentures. Our reinsurance company subsidiaries are subject to various statutory and regulatory restrictions, applicable to insurance companies generally, that limit the amount of cash dividends, loans and advances that those subsidiaries may pay to us. Covenants contained in certain of our debt agreements also restrict the ability of certain subsidiaries to pay dividends and make other distributions or loans to us. In addition, we cannot assure you that more stringent dividend restrictions will not be adopted, as discussed above under \u201cOur reinsurance subsidiaries are highly regulated, and changes in these regulations could negatively affect our business.\u201d\nAs a result of our insurance holding company structure, upon the insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding-up of one of our reinsurance subsidiaries, all creditors of that subsidiary would be entitled to payment in full out of the assets of such subsidiary before we, as shareholder, would be entitled to any payment. Our subsidiaries would have to pay their direct creditors in full before our creditors, including holders of common stock, preferred stock or debt securities of RGA, could receive any payment from the assets of such subsidiaries.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency risk.\nWe are a multi-national company with operations in numerous countries and, as a result, are exposed to foreign currency risk to the extent that exchange rates of foreign currencies are subject to adverse change over time. The U.S. dollar value of our net investments in foreign operations, our foreign currency transaction settlements and the periodic conversion of the foreign-denominated earnings to U.S. dollars (our reporting currency) are each subject to adverse foreign exchange rate movements. A significant portion of our revenues and our fixed maturity securities available-for-sale are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We use hedging strategies and foreign-denominated revenues and investments to fund foreign-denominated expenses and liabilities when possible to mitigate exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, but these mitigation efforts may not be successful.\nOur international operations involve inherent risks.\nA significant portion of our net premiums come from our operations outside of the U.S. One of our strategies is to grow these international operations. International operations subject us to various inherent risks. We may not be able to manage the growth of these operations effectively, particularly given the recent rates of growth. Our international operations expose us to mortality and morbidity experience, and supply and demand for our products that are specific to these markets as well as altered exposure to epidemic and pandemic risks that may be difficult to anticipate. In addition to the regulatory and foreign currency risks identified above, other related risks include uncertainty arising out of foreign government sovereignty over our international operations, potentially uncertain or adverse tax consequences (including the repatriation of earnings from our non-U.S. subsidiaries) and potential reduction in opportunities resulting from market access restrictions.\nSome of our international operations are in emerging markets where these risks are heightened, and we anticipate that we will continue to do business in such markets. Our pricing assumptions may be less predictable in emerging markets, and deviations in actual experience from these assumptions could impact our profitability in these markets. Additionally, lack of\nlegal certainty and stability in the emerging markets exposes us to increased risk of disruption and adverse or unpredictable actions by regulators and may make it more difficult for us to enforce our contracts, which may negatively impact our business.\nThe decision by the UK to exit the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d), or Brexit, created significant uncertainty about the future of insurance and reinsurance regulation in the UK as well as the terms upon which a reinsurer will be permitted to access the UK market or operate to serve other markets from within the UK. The effects of the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU and the implementation of agreements between the EU and UK in connection therewith on our business or our investment portfolios remains uncertain at this time. It is possible that there will be greater restrictions, requirements and regulatory complexities on reinsurance provided in the UK by entities located outside of the UK, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Furthermore, Brexit could adversely affect European and worldwide economic conditions and could contribute to greater instability in the global financial markets before and after the terms of the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU are settled.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to manage the risks associated with our international operations effectively or that they will not have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe depend on the performance of others, and their failure to perform in a satisfactory manner would negatively affect us.\nIn the normal course of business, we seek to limit our exposure to losses from our reinsurance contracts by ceding a portion of the reinsurance to other insurance enterprises or retrocessionaires. We cannot assure you that these insurance enterprises or retrocessionaires will be able to fulfill their obligations to us. We are also subject to the risk that our clients will be unable to fulfill their obligations to us under our reinsurance agreements with them.\nWe rely upon our insurance company clients to provide timely, accurate information. We may experience volatility in our earnings as a result of erroneous or untimely reporting from our clients. We also rely on original underwriting decisions made by our clients and cannot assure you that our clients\u2019 processes will adequately control business quality or establish appropriate pricing.\nFor some reinsurance agreements, the ceding company withholds and legally owns and manages assets equal to the net statutory reserves, and we reflect these assets as funds withheld at interest on our balance sheet. If a ceding company was to become insolvent, we would need to assert a claim on the assets supporting our reserve liabilities. We attempt to mitigate our risk of loss by offsetting amounts for claims or allowances that we owe the ceding company with amounts that the ceding company owes to us. We are subject to the investment performance on the withheld assets, although we do not directly control them. We help to set, and monitor compliance with, the investment guidelines followed by these ceding companies. However, to the extent that such investment guidelines are not appropriate, or to the extent that the ceding companies do not adhere to such guidelines, our risk of loss could increase, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. For additional information on funds withheld at interest, see \u201cInvestments - Funds Withheld at Interest\u201d in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nWe use the services of third parties such as asset managers, software vendors and administrators to perform various functions that are important to our business. For instance, we have engaged third party investment managers to manage certain assets where our investment management expertise is limited, who we rely on to provide investment advice and execute investment transactions that are within our investment policy guidelines. Our third-party service providers rely on their computer systems and their ability to maintain the security, confidentiality, integrity and privacy of those systems and the data residing on such systems. Our service providers may be subject to cybersecurity attacks and may not sufficiently protect their information technology and related data, which may impact their ability to provide us services and protect our data, which may subject us to losses and harm our reputation. Poor performance on the part of these outside vendors could negatively affect our operations and financial performance.\nAs with all financial services companies, our ability to conduct business depends on consumer confidence in the industry and our financial strength. Actions of competitors, and financial difficulties of other companies in the industry, and related adverse publicity, could undermine consumer confidence and harm our reputation and business.\nEpidemics and pandemics, natural and man-made disasters, catastrophes and events, including terrorist attacks, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEpidemics, pandemics, such as COVID-19, as well as natural disasters, climate change and terrorist attacks, and other catastrophes and events can adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations because they exacerbate mortality and morbidity risk. The likelihood, timing, and severity of these events cannot be predicted. A pandemic or other disaster could have a major impact on the global economy or the economies of particular countries or regions, including travel, trade, tourism, the health system, food supply, consumption, and overall economic output. Additionally, any such events could have a material negative impact on the financial markets, potentially impacting the value and liquidity of our invested assets,\naccess to capital markets and credit, and the business of our clients. In addition, a pandemic or other disaster that affected our employees or the employees of companies with which we do business could disrupt our business operations. The effectiveness of external parties, including governmental and non-governmental organizations, in combating the spread and severity of such an event could have a material impact on the losses we experience. These events could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any period and, depending on their severity, could also materially and adversely affect our financial condition.\nAdditionally, the impact of an increase in global average temperatures could cause changes in weather patterns, resulting in more severe and more frequent natural disasters such as forest fires, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods and storm surges and may impact disease incidence and severity, food and water supplies and the general health of impacted populations. These climate change trends are expected to continue in the future and may impact nearly all sectors of the economy to varying degrees. We cannot predict the long-term impacts of climate change for the Company and our clients, but such events may adversely impact our mortality and morbidity rates and also may impact asset prices, financial markets and general economic conditions.\nWe operate in a highly competitive and dynamic industry and competition, tax law changes, an economic downturn and other factors could adversely affect our business.\nThe reinsurance industry is highly competitive, and we encounter significant competition in all lines of business from other reinsurance companies, as well as competition from other providers of financial services. Our competitors vary by geographic market, and many of our competitors have greater financial resources than we do. Our ability to compete depends on, among other things, pricing and other terms and conditions of reinsurance agreements, our ability to maintain strong financial strength ratings, and our service and experience in the types of business that we underwrite.\nWe compete based on the strength of our underwriting operations, insights on mortality trends, our ability to efficiently execute transactions, our client relationships and our responsive service. We believe our quick response time to client requests for individual underwriting quotes, our underwriting expertise and our ability to structure solutions to meet clients\u2019 needs are important elements to our strategy and lead to other business opportunities with our clients. Our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain these competitive advantages.\nThe insurance and reinsurance industries are subject to ongoing changes from market pressures brought about by customer demands, changes in law, changes in economic conditions such as interest rates and investment performance, technological innovation, marketing practices and new providers of insurance and reinsurance solutions. Failure to anticipate market trends or to differentiate our products and services may affect our ability to grow or maintain our current position in the industry. A failure by the insurance industry to meet evolving consumer demands, including demands to address disparate impacts that may exist against certain groups in insurers\u2019 underwriting and sales models, could adversely affect the insurance industry and our operating results. Similarly, our failure to meet the changing demands of our insurance company clients through innovative product development, effective distribution channels and investments in technology could negatively impact our financial performance over the long-term. Additionally, our failure to adjust our strategies in response to changing economic conditions could impact our competitive position and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the U.S. Internal Revenue Code is revised to reduce benefits associated with the tax-deferred status of certain life insurance and annuity products, or to increase the tax-deferred status of competing products, all life insurance companies would be adversely affected with respect to their ability to sell such products, and, depending on grandfathering provisions, by the surrenders of existing annuity contracts and life insurance policies. In addition, life insurance products are often used to fund estate tax obligations. If Congress adopts legislation in the future to reduce or eliminate the estate tax, our U.S. life insurance company customers could face reduced demand for some of their life insurance products, which in turn could negatively affect our reinsurance business. We cannot predict whether any tax legislation impacting corporate taxes or insurance products will be enacted, what the specific terms of any such legislation will be or whether any such legislation would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA general economic downturn or a downturn in the capital markets could adversely affect the market for many life insurance and annuity products. Factors such as consumer spending, business investment, government spending, the volatility and strength of the capital markets, deflation and inflation affect the economic environment and thus the profitability of our business. An economic downturn may yield higher unemployment and lower family income, corporate earnings, business investment and consumer spending, and could result in decreased demand for life insurance and annuity products. Because we obtain substantially all our revenues through reinsurance arrangements that cover a portfolio of life insurance products and annuities, our business would be harmed if the market for annuities or life insurance was adversely affected. Therefore, adverse changes in the economy could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could be subject to additional income tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations and administrative practices in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes.\nThe U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS continue to issue guidance under the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\u201cU.S. Tax Reform\u201d) that may result in interpretations different from ours. Foreign governments may enact tax laws in response to U.S. Tax Reform that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations. In addition a number of countries are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to multinational corporations.\nAcquisitions and significant transactions involve varying degrees of risk that could affect our profitability.\nWe have made, and may in the future make, acquisitions, either of selected blocks of business or other companies. The success of these acquisitions depends on, among other factors, our ability to appropriately price and evaluate the risks of the acquired business, as well as the availability of funding sufficient to meet increased capital needs, the ability to fund cash flow shortages that may occur if anticipated revenues are not realized or are delayed and the possibility that the value of investments acquired in an acquisition may be lower than expected or may diminish due to credit defaults or changes in interest rates and that liabilities assumed may be greater than expected (due to, among other factors, less favorable than expected mortality or morbidity experience). Additionally, acquisitions may expose us to other operational challenges and various risks, including the ability to integrate the acquired business operations and data with our systems. A failure to successfully manage the operational challenges and risks associated with or resulting from significant transactions, including acquisitions, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur risk management policies and procedures could leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur risk management policies and procedures, designed to identify, monitor and manage both internal and external risks, may not adequately predict future exposures, which could be significantly greater than expected. In addition, these identified risks may not be the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThere are inherent limitations to risk management strategies because there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that we have not appropriately anticipated or identified. If our risk management framework proves ineffective, we may suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected. As our businesses change and the markets in which we operate evolve, our risk management framework may not evolve at the same pace as those changes. As a result, there is a risk that new business strategies may present risks that are not appropriately identified, monitored or managed. In times of market stress, unanticipated market movements or unanticipated claims experience resulting from adverse mortality, morbidity or policyholder behavior, the effectiveness of our risk management strategies may be limited, resulting in losses. In addition, under difficult or less liquid market conditions, our risk management strategies may be less effective and/or more expensive because other market participants may be using the same or similar strategies to manage risk under the same challenging market conditions.\nPast or future misconduct by our employees or employees of our vendors could result in violations of law, regulatory sanctions and serious reputational or financial harm and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective. There can be no assurance that our controls and procedures designed to monitor associates\u2019 business decisions and prevent us from taking excessive or inappropriate risks will be effective. We review our compensation policies and practices as part of our overall risk management program, but it is possible that our compensation policies and practices could inadvertently incentivize excessive or inappropriate risk taking, which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nThe failure in cyber or other information security systems, including a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality, integrity or privacy of sensitive data residing on such systems, as well as the occurrence of unanticipated events affecting our disaster recovery systems and business continuity planning, could impair our ability to conduct business effectively.\nOur business is highly dependent upon the effective operation of our computer systems. The failure of our computer systems or disaster recovery capabilities for any reason could cause significant interruptions in our operations and result in a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality, integrity or privacy of sensitive or personal data related to our customers, insured individuals or employees. Like other global companies, we have experienced threats to our data and systems from time to time. However, we have not detected or identified any evidence to indicate we have experienced a material breach of cybersecurity. Administrative and technical controls, security measures and other preventative actions we take to reduce the risk of such incidents and protect our information technology may not be sufficient to prevent physical and electronic break-ins, and\nsimilar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems. Such a failure could harm our reputation, subject us to investigations, litigation, regulatory sanctions and other claims and expenses, lead to loss of customers and revenues and otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe rely on our computer systems for a variety of business functions across our global operations, including for the administration of our business, underwriting, claims, performing actuarial analysis and maintaining financial records. We depend heavily upon these computer systems to provide reliable service, data and reports. Upon a disaster such as a natural catastrophe, epidemic, industrial accident, blackout, computer virus, terrorist attack or war, unanticipated problems with our disaster recovery systems could have a material adverse impact on our ability to conduct business and on our financial condition and results of operations, particularly if those problems affect our computer-based data processing, transmission, storage and retrieval systems and destroy valuable data. While we maintain liability insurance for cybersecurity and network interruption losses, our insurance may not be sufficient to protect us against all losses. In addition, if a significant number of our managers were unavailable upon a disaster, our ability to effectively conduct business could be severely compromised. These interruptions also may interfere with our clients\u2019 ability to provide data and other information to us, and our employees\u2019 ability to perform their job responsibilities.\nFailure to protect the confidentiality of information could adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMany jurisdictions in which we operate have enacted laws to safeguard the privacy and security of personal information. Additionally, various government agencies have established rules protecting the privacy and security of such information. These laws and rules vary greatly by jurisdiction. Some of our employees have access to personal information of policy holders. We rely on internal controls to protect the confidentiality of this information. It is possible that an employee could, intentionally or unintentionally, disclose or misappropriate confidential information or our data could be the subject of a cybersecurity attack. If we fail to maintain adequate internal controls or if our employees fail to comply with our policies, misappropriation or intentional or unintentional inappropriate disclosure or misuse of client information could occur. Such internal control inadequacies or non-compliance could materially damage our reputation or lead to civil or criminal penalties, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we analyze customer data to better manage our business. There has been increased scrutiny, including from U.S. state regulators, regarding the use of \u201cbig data\u201d techniques. We cannot predict what, if any, actions may be taken with regard to \u201cbig data,\u201d but any inquiries could cause reputational harm and any limitations could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nManaging key employee attraction, retention and succession is critical to our success.\nOur success depends in large part upon our ability to identify, hire, retain and motivate highly skilled employees. We would be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of our senior management and other key employees. While we have succession plans and long-term compensation plans designed to retain our existing employees and attract and retain additional qualified personnel in the future, our succession plans may not operate effectively and our compensation plans cannot guarantee that the services of these employees will continue to be available to us.\nLitigation and regulatory investigations and actions may result in financial losses or harm our reputation.\nWe are, and in the future may be, subject to litigation and regulatory investigations or actions in the ordinary course of our business. A substantial legal liability or a significant federal, state or other regulatory action against us, as well as regulatory inquiries or investigations, could harm our reputation, result in material fines or penalties, result in significant legal costs and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Regulatory inquiries and litigation may also cause volatility in the price of stocks of companies in our industry or in our stock price. Material pending litigation and regulatory matters affecting us, if any, are discussed in Item 8. \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 12 Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees.\u201d\nRisks Related to Our Investments\nAdverse capital and credit market conditions and access to credit facilities may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs, access to capital and cost of capital.\nThe capital and credit markets experience varying degrees of volatility and disruption. In some periods, the markets have exerted downward pressure on availability of liquidity and credit capacity for certain issuers. We need liquidity to make our benefit payments, to pay our operating expenses, interest on our debt and dividends on our capital stock and to replace certain maturing liabilities. Without sufficient liquidity, we will be forced to curtail our operations, and our business will be adversely affected. The principal sources of our liquidity are reinsurance premiums under reinsurance treaties and cash flows from our investment portfolio and other assets. Sources of liquidity in normal markets also include proceeds from the issuance\nof a variety of short- and long-term instruments, including medium- and long-term debt, subordinated and junior subordinated debt securities, capital securities and common stock.\nIf current resources do not satisfy our needs, we may have to seek additional financing. The availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of equity and credit, the volume of trading activities, the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity, as well as the possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects. Similarly, our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us. Our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient, and in such case, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all.\nDisruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit markets may limit our ability to replace maturing liabilities in a timely manner, satisfy statutory capital requirements, generate fee income and market-related revenue to meet liquidity needs and access the capital necessary to grow our business. As such, we may be forced to delay raising capital, issue shorter tenor securities than we prefer, or bear an unattractive cost of capital, which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility. Further, our ability to finance our statutory reserve requirements depends on market conditions. If market capacity is limited for a prolonged period, our ability to obtain new funding for such purposes may be hindered and, as a result, our ability to write additional business in a cost-effective manner may be limited or otherwise adversely affected.\nWe also rely on our unsecured credit facilities, including our $850 million syndicated credit facility, as potential sources of liquidity. Our credit facilities contain administrative, reporting, legal and financial covenants, and our syndicated credit facility includes requirements to maintain a specified minimum consolidated net worth and a minimum ratio of consolidated indebtedness to total capitalization. If we were unable to access our credit facilities it could materially impact our capital position. The availability of these facilities could be critical to our credit and financial strength ratings and our ability to meet our obligations as they come due in a market when alternative sources of credit are unavailable.\nDifficult conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and statutory capital position are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally, both in the U.S. and elsewhere around the world. Poor economic conditions, volatility and disruptions in capital markets or financial asset classes and geopolitical upheaval (including trade disputes) can have an adverse effect on our business because our investment portfolio and some of our liabilities are sensitive to changing market factors. Additionally, disruptions in one market or asset class can also spread to other markets or asset classes.\nConcerns over U.S. fiscal policy and the trajectory of the U.S. national debt could have severe repercussions to the U.S. and global credit and financial markets, further exacerbate concerns over sovereign debt and disrupt economic activity in the U.S. and elsewhere. As a result, our access to, or cost of, liquidity may deteriorate. As a result of uncertainty regarding U.S. national debt, the market value of some of our investments may decrease, and our capital adequacy could be adversely affected. Political and economic uncertainties and weakness and disruption of the financial markets around the world, such as geopolitical upheaval (including trade disputes) and deteriorating economic and political relationships between countries, the impacts of the decision of Great Britain to leave the European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d), the solvency of certain European Union member states and of financial institutions that have significant direct or indirect exposure to debt issued by such countries, have led and may continue to lead to concerns over capital markets access. In addition, there are ongoing risks around the world related to interest rate fluctuations, slowing global growth, commodity prices and the devaluation of certain currencies. These events and continuing market upheavals may have an adverse effect on us, in part because we have a large investment portfolio and are also dependent upon customer behavior. Our revenues may decline in such circumstances and our profit margins may erode. In addition, upon prolonged market events, such as the global credit crisis, we could incur significant investment-related losses. Even in the absence of a market downturn, we are exposed to substantial risk of loss due to market volatility.\nIf our investment strategy is unsuccessful, we could suffer losses.\nThe success of our investment strategy is crucial to the success of our business. We structure our investments to match our anticipated liabilities under reinsurance treaties to the extent we believe necessary. If our calculations with respect to these reinsurance liabilities are incorrect, or if we improperly structure our investments to match such liabilities, we could be forced to liquidate investments prior to maturity at a significant loss.\nOur investment guidelines limit non-investment grade fixed maturity securities in our investment portfolio. While any investment carries some risk, the risks associated with lower-rated securities are greater than the risks associated with investment grade securities. The risk of loss of principal or interest through default is greater because lower-rated securities are usually unsecured and are often subordinated to an issuer\u2019s other obligations. Additionally, the issuers of these securities\nfrequently have relatively high debt levels and are thus more sensitive to difficult economic conditions, specific corporate developments and rising interest rates, which could impair an issuer\u2019s capacity or willingness to meet its financial commitment on such lower-rated securities. As a result, the market price of these securities may be quite volatile, and the risk of loss is greater.\nThe success of any investment activity is affected by general economic conditions, including the level and volatility of interest rates and the extent and timing of investor participation in such markets, which may adversely affect the markets for interest rate sensitive securities, mortgages and equity securities. Unexpected volatility or illiquidity in the markets in which we directly or indirectly hold positions could adversely affect us.\nInterest rate fluctuations could negatively affect the income we derive from the difference between the interest rates we earn on our investments and interest we pay under our reinsurance contracts.\nSignificant changes in interest rates expose reinsurance companies to the risk of reduced investment income or actual losses based on the difference between the interest rates earned on investments and the credited interest rates paid on outstanding reinsurance contracts. Both rising and declining interest rates can negatively affect the income we derive from these interest rate spreads. During periods of rising interest rates, we may be contractually obligated to reimburse our clients for the greater amounts they credit on certain interest-sensitive products. However, we may not have the ability to immediately acquire investments with interest rates sufficient to offset the increased crediting rates on our reinsurance contracts. During periods of falling interest rates, our investment earnings will be lower because new investments in fixed maturity securities will likely bear lower interest rates. We may not be able to fully offset the decline in investment earnings with lower crediting rates on underlying annuity products related to certain of our reinsurance contracts. Our asset/liability management programs and procedures may not reduce the volatility of our income when interest rates are rising or falling, and thus we cannot assure you that changes in interest rates will not affect our interest rate spreads.\nChanges in interest rates may also affect our business in other ways. Higher interest rates may result in increased surrenders on interest-based products of our clients, which may affect our fees and earnings on those products. Lower interest rates may result in lower sales of certain insurance and investment products of our clients, which would reduce the demand for our reinsurance of these products. If interest rates remain low for an extended period, it may adversely affect our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe liquidity and value of some of our investments may become significantly diminished.\nThere may be illiquid markets for certain investments we hold in our investment portfolio. These include privately-placed fixed maturity securities, options and other derivative instruments, mortgage loans, policy loans, limited partnership interests, and real estate equity, such as real estate joint ventures and funds. Additionally, markets for certain of our investments that are currently liquid may experience reduced liquidity during periods of market volatility or disruption. If we were forced to sell certain of our investments into illiquid markets, prices may be lower than our carrying value in such investments. This could result in realized losses which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, as well as our financial ratios, which could affect compliance with our credit instruments and rating agency capital adequacy measures.\nWe could be forced to sell investments at a loss to cover policyholder withdrawals, recaptures of reinsurance treaties or other events.\nSome of the products offered by our insurance company customers allow policyholders and contract holders to withdraw their funds under defined circumstances. Our reinsurance subsidiaries manage their liabilities and configure their investment portfolios to provide and maintain sufficient liquidity to support anticipated withdrawal demands and contract benefits and maturities under reinsurance treaties with these customers. While our reinsurance subsidiaries own a significant amount of liquid assets, a portion of their assets are relatively illiquid. Unanticipated withdrawal or surrender activity could, under some circumstances, require our reinsurance subsidiaries to dispose of assets on unfavorable terms, which could have an adverse effect on us. Reinsurance agreements may provide for recapture rights on the part of our insurance company customers. Recapture rights permit these customers to reassume all or a portion of the risk formerly ceded to us after an agreed-upon time, usually ten years, subject to various conditions.\nRecapture of business previously ceded does not affect premiums ceded prior to the recapture, but may result in immediate payments to our insurance company customers and a charge to income for costs that we deferred when we acquired the business but are unable to recover upon recapture. Under some circumstances, payments to our insurance company customers could require our reinsurance subsidiaries to dispose of assets on unfavorable terms.\nDefaults, downgrades or other events impairing the value of our fixed maturity securities portfolio may reduce our earnings.\nWe are subject to the risk that the issuers, or guarantors, of fixed maturity securities we own may default on principal and interest payments they owe us. Fixed maturity securities represent a substantial portion of our total cash and invested assets. The occurrence of a major or prolonged economic downturn, acts of corporate malfeasance, widening risk spreads, or other events that adversely affect the issuers or guarantors of these securities could cause the value of our fixed maturity securities portfolio and our net income to decline and the default rate of the fixed maturity securities in our investment portfolio to increase. A ratings downgrade affecting issuers or guarantors of particular securities, or similar trends that could worsen the credit quality of issuers, such as the corporate issuers of securities in our investment portfolio, could also have a similar effect. With economic uncertainty, credit quality of issuers or guarantors could be adversely affected. Any event reducing the value of these securities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe defaults or deteriorating credit of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nWe have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, insurance companies, commercial banks, investment banks, investment funds and other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk upon default of our counterparty. In addition, with respect to secured and other transactions that provide for us to hold collateral posted by the counterparty, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral we hold cannot be liquidated at prices sufficient to recover the full amount of our exposure. We also have exposure to these financial institutions in the form of unsecured debt instruments, derivative transactions and equity investments. There can be no assurance that losses or impairments to the carrying value of these assets would not materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nDefaults on our mortgage loans or the mortgage loans underlying our investments in mortgage-backed securities and volatility in performance of our investments in real-estate related assets may adversely affect our profitability.\nA portion of our investment portfolio consists of assets linked to real estate, including mortgage loans on commercial properties, lifetime mortgages, investments in commercial mortgage-backed securities (\u201cCMBS\u201d), and residential mortgage-backed securities (\u201cRMBS\u201d). Delinquency and defaults by third parties in the payment or performance of their obligations underlying these assets could reduce our investment income and realized investment gains or result in the recognition of investment losses. Mortgage loans are stated on our balance sheet at unpaid principal balance, adjusted for any unamortized premium or discount, deferred fees or expenses, and are net of valuation allowances established as of the balance sheet date. Such valuation allowances are based on the excess carrying value of the loan over the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan\u2019s original effective interest rate, the value of the loan\u2019s collateral if the loan is in the process of foreclosure or is otherwise collateral-dependent, or the loan\u2019s market value if the loan is being sold. CMBS and RMBS are stated on our balance sheet at fair value. The performance of our mortgage loan investments and our investments in CMBS and RMBS, however, may fluctuate in the future. An increase in the default rate of our mortgage loan investments or the mortgage loans underlying our investments in CMBS and RMBS could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nFurther, any geographic or sector concentration of our mortgage loans or the mortgage loans underlying our investments in CMBS and RMBS may have adverse effects on our investment portfolios and consequently on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. Events or developments that have a negative effect on any particular geographic region or sector may have a greater adverse effect on our investment portfolios to the extent that the portfolios are concentrated. Moreover, our ability to sell assets relating to such particular groups of related assets may be limited if other market participants are seeking to sell at the same time.\nOur valuation of fixed maturity and equity securities and derivatives include methodologies, estimations and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to investment valuations that may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nFixed maturity, equity securities and short-term investments, which are primarily reported at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets, represent the majority of our total cash and invested assets. As described in Item 8. \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 6 \u201cFair Value of Assets and Liabilities\u201d, we have categorized these securities into a three-level hierarchy, based on the priority of the inputs to the respective valuation technique.\nDuring periods of market disruption, including periods of significantly rising or high interest rates, rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity, it may be difficult to value certain of our securities if trading becomes less frequent or market data becomes less observable. There may be certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to the financial environment. As such, valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less\nobservable or require greater estimation resulting in values that may be different than the value at which the investments may be ultimately sold. Further, rapidly changing or disruptive credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of securities as reported within our consolidated financial statements and the period-to-period changes in value could vary significantly. Decreases in value may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe reported value of our investments, including our relatively illiquid asset classes and, at times, our high-quality, generally liquid asset classes, do not necessarily reflect the lowest current market price for the asset. If we were forced to sell certain of our assets in disruptive or volatile market conditions, there can be no assurance that we will be able to sell them for the prices at which we have recorded them and we may be forced to sell them at significantly lower prices.\nThe determination of the amount of allowances and impairments taken on our investments is highly subjective and could materially affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe determination of the amount of allowances and impairments vary by investment type and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. Management updates its evaluations regularly and reflects changes in allowances and impairments in operations as such evaluations are revised. For example, the cost of our fixed maturity securities is adjusted for impairments in value deemed to be impaired in the period in which the determination is made. The assessment of whether impairments have occurred is based on management\u2019s case-by-case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in fair value. Inherent in management\u2019s evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential. There can be no assurance that our management has accurately assessed the level of impairments taken, or allowances reflected in our financial statements and their potential impact on regulatory capital. Furthermore, additional impairments or additional allowances may be needed in the future.\nOur investments are reflected within the consolidated financial statements utilizing different accounting bases and accordingly we may not have recognized differences, which may be significant, between cost and fair value in our consolidated financial statements.\nCertain of our principal investments are in fixed maturity securities, short-term investments, mortgage loans, policy loans, funds withheld at interest and other invested assets. The carrying value of such investments is described in \u201cInvestments\u201d in Note 2 - \u201cSignificant Accounting Polices and Pronouncements\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Investments not carried at fair value in our consolidated financial statements - principally, mortgage loans, policy loans, real estate joint ventures and other limited partnerships - may have fair values that are substantially higher or lower than the carrying value reflected in our consolidated financial statements. Each of such asset classes is regularly evaluated for impairment under the accounting guidance appropriate to the respective asset class.\nPhasing out of London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) after 2021 may adversely affect the value of certain of our LIBOR-based assets and liabilities.\nIt is anticipated that LIBOR will be discontinued by the end of 2021. The ICE Benchmark Administrated Limited is currently consulting regarding the potential for continuing the 1, 3, 6 and 12 month LIBOR on U.S. dollars until June 2023. At this time, it is not possible to predict how markets will respond and the effect that the discontinuation of LIBOR and the implementation of new benchmark rates will have on new or existing financial instruments to which we have exposure. Interest rates on our LIBOR-based and other floating-rate assets and liabilities may be adversely affected. Further, any uncertainty regarding replacements for LIBOR as a benchmark interest rate could adversely affect the trading market for and value of LIBOR-based and other floating-rate securities, including certain of our assets and liabilities. We are not able to predict the impact of such changes on our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nWe may not pay dividends on our common stock.\nOur shareholders may not receive dividends. All future payments of dividends are at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings, capital requirements, insurance regulatory conditions, operating conditions and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant. The amount of dividends that we can pay will depend in part on the operations of our reinsurance subsidiaries. Under certain circumstances, we may be contractually prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock due to restrictions associated with certain of our debt securities.\nCertain provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws, in Missouri law and in applicable insurance laws, may delay or prevent a change in control, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nCertain provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws, as well as Missouri corporate law and state insurance laws, may delay or prevent a change of control of RGA, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock. Our\narticles of incorporation and bylaws contain some provisions that may make the acquisition of control of RGA without the approval of our board of directors more difficult, including provisions relating to the nomination, election and removal of directors and limitations on actions by our shareholders. In addition, Missouri law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between RGA and holders of 20% or more of our outstanding common stock. These provisions may have unintended anti-takeover effects, including to delay or prevent a change in control of RGA, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nBefore a person can acquire control of a U.S. insurance company, prior written approval must be obtained from the insurance commission of the state where the domestic insurer is domiciled. Under U.S. state insurance laws and regulations, any person acquiring 10% or more of the outstanding voting securities of a corporation, such as our common stock, is presumed to have acquired control of that corporation and its subsidiaries. Similar laws in other countries where we operate limit our ability to effect changes of control for subsidiaries organized in such jurisdictions without the approval of local insurance regulatory officials. Prior to granting approval of an application to directly or indirectly acquire control of a domestic or foreign insurer, an insurance regulator in any jurisdiction may consider such factors as the financial strength of the applicant, the integrity of the applicant\u2019s board of directors and executive officers, the applicant\u2019s plans for the future operations of the domestic insurer and any anti-competitive results that may arise from the consummation of the acquisition of control.\nIssuing additional shares may dilute the value or affect the price of our common stock.\nOur board of directors has the authority, without action or vote of the shareholders, to issue any or all authorized but unissued shares of our common stock, including securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, our common stock and authorized but unissued shares under our equity compensation plans. In the future, we may issue such additional securities, through public or private offerings, in order to raise additional capital. Any such issuance will dilute the percentage ownership of shareholders and may dilute the per share projected earnings or book value of our common stock. In addition, option holders may exercise their options at any time when we would otherwise be able to obtain additional equity capital on more favorable terms.\nThe occurrence of various events may adversely affect the ability of RGA and its subsidiaries to fully utilize any net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) and other tax attributes.\nRGA and its subsidiaries may, from time to time, have a substantial amount of NOLs and other tax attributes, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, to offset taxable income and gains. If a corporation experiences an ownership change, it is generally subject to an annual limitation, which limits its ability to use its NOLs and other tax attributes. Events outside of our control may cause RGA (and, consequently, its subsidiaries) to experience an \u201cownership change\u201d under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code and the related Treasury regulations, and limit the ability of RGA and its subsidiaries to utilize fully such NOLs and other tax attributes. If we were to experience an ownership change, we could potentially have higher U.S. federal income tax liabilities than we would otherwise have had, which would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 92799, "SIC": 6311, "TIC": "RGA"}
