{"cik": "1211805", "company": "My Size, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-04", "item_1A": "Item 1A - Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the \tfollowing risk factors and the other information in this registration statement before investing in our common stock. Our business and results of operations could be seriously harmed by any of the following risks. The risks set out below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or \toperating results. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the value and trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Company and Our Business\nChanges in economic conditions, including continuing effects from the recent recession, could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause our customers are retailers, we, together with the rest of the retail industry, depend upon consumer discretionary spending. The recent recession, coupled with high unemployment rates, reduced home values, increases in home foreclosures, investment losses, personal bankruptcies and reduced access to credit and reduced consumer confidence, has impacted consumers\u2019 ability and willingness to spend discretionary dollars. Economic conditions may remain volatile and may continue to repress consumer confidence and discretionary spending for the near term.\nDamage to our reputation or lack of acceptance of our brand in existing and new markets could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe believe we are building a strong reputation for the quality of our technology, and we must protect and grow the value of our brand to continue to be successful in the future. Any incident that erodes consumer affinity for our brand could significantly reduce its value and damage our business. If guests perceive or experience a reduction in quality, or in any way believe we failed to deliver a consistently positive experience, our brand value could suffer and our business may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, our ability to successfully develop new retailers in new markets may be adversely affected by a lack of awareness or acceptance of our brand in these new markets. To the extent that we are unable to foster name recognition and affinity for our brand in new markets, our growth may be significantly delayed or impaired.\nAs a result, adverse economic conditions in any of these areas could have a material adverse effect on our overall results of operations. In recent years, certain of these states have been more negatively impacted by the housing decline, high unemployment rates and the overall economic crisis than other geographic areas. In addition, given our geographic concentration, negative publicity regarding any of our retailers in these areas could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations, as could other regional occurrences such as local strikes, terrorist attacks, increases in energy prices, adverse weather conditions, hurricanes, droughts or other natural or man-made disasters.\nIn particular, adverse weather conditions can impact guest traffic at our retailers, and, in more severe cases, cause temporary retail closures, sometimes for prolonged periods. Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations, with retail sales typically higher during certain months, such as December. Adverse weather conditions during our most favorable months or periods may exacerbate the effect of adverse weather on guest traffic and may cause fluctuations in our operating results from quarter-to-quarter within a fiscal year.\nWe might not be able to market our products.\nWe expend significant resources in our marketing efforts, using a variety of media, including social media venues. We expect to continue to conduct brand awareness programs and guest initiatives to attract and retain guests. These initiatives may not be successful, resulting in expenses incurred without the benefit of higher revenues. Additionally, some of our competitors have greater financial resources, which enable them to purchase significantly more advertising than we are able to purchase. Should our competitors increase spending on advertising and promotions or our advertising funds decrease for any reason, or should our advertising and promotions be less effective than our competitors, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business operations and future development could be significantly disrupted if we lose key members of our management team.\nThe success of our business continues to depend to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our senior officers and key employees, both individually and as a group. Our future performance will be substantially dependent in particular on our ability to retain and motivate our Chief Executive Officer, and certain of our other senior executive officers. We currently do not have an employment agreement in place with these officers. The loss of the services of our CEO, senior officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business and plans for future development. We have no reason to believe that we will lose the services of any of these individuals in the foreseeable future; however, we currently have no effective replacement for any of these individuals due to their experience, reputation in the industry and special role in our operations. We also do not maintain any key man life insurance policies for any of our employees.\nOur growth may strain our infrastructure and resources, which could slow our development of new retailers and adversely affect our ability to manage our existing retailers.\nOur future growth may strain our retail management systems and resources, financial controls and information systems. Those demands on our infrastructure and resources may also adversely affect our ability to manage our existing retailers. If we fail to continue to improve our infrastructure or to manage other factors necessary for us to meet our expansion objectives, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. Likewise, if sales decline, we may be unable to reduce our infrastructure quickly enough to prevent sales deleveraging, which would adversely affect our profitability.\nRetailers have been the target of class-actions and other litigation alleging, among other things, violations of federal and state law.\nOur customers are subject to a variety of lawsuits, administrative proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business. In recent years, a number of retail companies have been subject to claims by guests, employees and others regarding issues such as safety, personal injury and premises liability, employment-related claims, harassment, discrimination, disability and other operational issues common to the retail industry. A number of these lawsuits have resulted in the payment of substantial damages by the defendants. We carry insurance programs with specific retention levels, for a significant portion of our risks and associated liabilities with respect to workers\u2019 compensation, general liability, employer\u2019s liability, health benefits and other insurable risks. The policy is limited to $3 million. Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are ultimately determined to be liable, we could also be adversely affected by negative publicity, litigation costs resulting from the defense of these claims and the diversion of time and resources from our operations.\nOur insurance policies may not provide adequate levels of coverage against all claims, and fluctuating insurance requirements and costs could negatively impact our profitability.\nWe believe our insurance coverage is customary for businesses of our size and type. However, there are types of losses we may incur that cannot be insured against or that we believe are not commercially reasonable to insure. These losses, if they occur, could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, the cost of workers\u2019 compensation insurance, general liability insurance and directors and officers\u2019 liability insurance fluctuates based on our historical trends, market conditions and availability. Additionally, health insurance costs in general have risen significantly over the past few years and are expected to continue to increase. These increases, as well as recently-enacted federal legislation requiring employers to provide specified levels of health insurance to all employees, could have a negative impact on our profitability, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully offset the effect of such increases with plan modifications and cost control measures, additional operating efficiencies or the pass-through of such increased costs to our guests.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which, in turn, could harm the value of our brands and adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to implement our business plan successfully depends in part on our ability to further build brand recognition using our trademarks, service marks and other proprietary intellectual property, including our names and logos and the unique ambiance of our retailers. We plan to register a number of our trademarks. We cannot assure you that our trademark applications will be approved. Third parties may also oppose our trademark applications, or otherwise challenge our use of the trademarks. In the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our goods and services, which could result in loss of brand recognition, and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands.\nIf our efforts to register, maintain and protect our intellectual property are inadequate, or if any third party misappropriates, dilutes or infringes on our intellectual property, the value of our brands may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and might prevent our brands from achieving or maintaining market acceptance. We may also face the risk of claims that we have infringed third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights. If third parties claim that we infringe upon their intellectual property rights, our operating profits could be adversely affected. Any claims of intellectual property infringement, even those without merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend, require us to rebrand our services, if feasible, divert management\u2019s attention and resources or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a third party\u2019s intellectual property.\nAny royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. A successful claim of infringement against us could result in our being required to pay significant damages, enter into costly license or royalty agreements, or stop the sale of certain products or services, any of which could have a negative impact on our operating profits and harm our future prospects.\nInformation technology system failures or breaches of our network security could interrupt our operations and adversely affect our business.\nWe will rely on our computer systems and network infrastructure across our operations. Our operations depend upon our ability to protect our computer equipment and systems against damage from physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events, as well as from internal and external security breaches, viruses, worms and other disruptive problems. Any damage or failure of our computer systems or network infrastructure that causes an interruption in our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and subject us to litigation or actions by regulatory authorities. Although we employ both internal resources and external consultants to conduct auditing and testing for weaknesses in our systems, controls, firewalls and encryption and intend to maintain and upgrade our security technology and operational procedures to prevent such damage, breaches or other disruptive problems, there can be no assurance that these security measures will be successful.\nWe will incur increased costs and obligations as a result of being a public company in the United States\nWe will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we were not required to incur in the recent past. We expect these rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time consuming and costly. We estimate that we will incur additional incremental costs per year associated with being a publicly-traded company; however, it is possible that our actual incremental costs of being a publicly-traded company will be higher than we currently estimate. In estimating these costs, we took into account expenses related to insurance, legal, accounting and compliance activities.\nFurthermore, the need to establish the corporate infrastructure demanded of a public company may divert management\u2019s attention from implementing our growth strategy, which could prevent us from improving our business, results of operations and financial condition. We have made, and will continue to make, changes to our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting and accounting systems to meet our reporting obligations as a publicly traded company. However, the measures we take may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations as a publicly traded company.\nFederal, state and local or Israeli tax rules may adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.\nWe are subject to federal, state and local taxes in the U.S., as well as local taxes in Israel in respect to our operations in Israel. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, if the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) or other taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken on our tax returns, we could face additional tax liability, including interest and penalties. If material, payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. In addition, complying with new tax rules, laws or regulations could impact our financial condition, and increases to federal or state statutory tax rates and other changes in tax laws, rules or regulations may increase our effective tax rate. Any increase in our effective tax rate could have a material impact on our financial results.\nWe may require additional capital to finance our operations in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed and could be dilutive to existing stockholders.\nWe may require additional capital for future operations. We plan to finance anticipated ongoing expenses and capital requirements with funds generated from the following sources:\n\u25cf cash provided by operating activities;\n\u25cf available cash and cash investments; and\n\u25cf capital raised through debt and equity offerings.\nCurrent conditions in the capital markets are such that traditional sources of capital may not be available to us when needed or may be available only on unfavorable terms. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, many of which are outside our control, and on our financial performance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully raise additional capital at all or on terms that are acceptable to us. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, it may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Further, if we raise capital by issuing stock, the holdings of our existing stockholders will be diluted.\nIf we raise capital by issuing debt securities, such debt securities would rank senior to our common stock upon our bankruptcy or liquidation. In addition, we may raise capital by issuing equity securities that may be senior to our common stock for the purposes of dividend and liquidating distributions, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Finally, upon bankruptcy or liquidation, holders of our debt securities and shares of preferred stock and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock. Additional equity offerings may dilute the holdings of our existing stockholders or reduce the market price of our common stock, or both.\nOur business is dependent upon continued market acceptance by consumers.\nWe are substantially dependent on continued market acceptance of our products by customers, and such customers are dependent upon regulatory and legislative forces. We cannot predict the future growth rate and size of this market.\nIf we are able to expand our operations, we may be unable to successfully manage our future growth.\nSince inception, we have been planning for the expansion of our brand. Any such growth could place increased strain on our management, operational, financial and other resources, and we will need to train, motivate, and manage employees, as well as attract management, sales, finance and accounting, international, technical, and other professionals. In addition, we will need to expand the scope of our infrastructure and our physical resources. Any failure to expand these areas and implement appropriate procedures and controls in an efficient manner and at a pace consistent with our business objectives could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nAny future litigation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nFrom time to time we may be subject to litigation, including potential stockholder derivative actions. Risks associated with legal liability are difficult to assess and quantify, and their existence and magnitude can remain unknown for significant periods of time. To date have obtained directors and officers liability (\u201cD&O\u201d) insurance to cover some of the risk exposure for our directors and officers. Such insurance generally pays the expenses (including amounts paid to plaintiffs, fines, and expenses including attorneys\u2019 fees) of officers and directors who are the subject of a lawsuit as a result of their service to the Company. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to maintain this insurance at reasonable rates or at all, or in amounts adequate to cover such expenses should such a lawsuit occur. While neither Delaware law nor our Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws require us to indemnify or advance expenses to our officers and directors involved in such a legal action, we expect that we would do so to the extent permitted by Delaware law. Without D&O insurance, the amounts we would pay to indemnify our officers and directors should they be subject to legal action based on their service to the Company could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nOur prior operating results may not be indicative of our future results.\nYou should not consider prior operating results to be indicative of our future operating results. The timing and amount of future revenues will depend almost entirely on our ability to open new retailers while maintaining consistency in our existing retail. Our future operating results will depend upon many other factors, including:\n- the level of product and price competition,\n- our success in expanding our business network and managing our growth,\n- the ability to hire qualified employees, and\n- the timing of such hiring and our ability to control costs.\nRequirements associated with being a reporting public company will require significant company resources and management attention.\nOnce the registration statement is effective by the SEC, we will be subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the other rules and regulations of the SEC relating to public companies. We are working with independent legal, accounting and financial advisors to identify those areas in which changes should be made to our financial and management control systems to manage our growth and our obligations as an SEC reporting company. These areas include corporate governance, internal control, internal audit, disclosure controls and procedures and financial reporting and accounting systems. We have made, and will continue to make, changes in these and other areas, including our internal control over financial reporting. However, we cannot assure you that these and other measures we may take will be sufficient to allow us to satisfy our obligations as an SEC reporting company on a timely basis.\nIn addition, compliance with reporting and other requirements applicable to SEC reporting companies will create additional costs for us, will require the time and attention of management and will require the hiring of additional personnel and legal, audit and other professionals. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of the additional costs we may incur, the timing of such costs or the impact that our management\u2019s attention to these matters will have on our business.\nOur management controls a large block of our common stock that will allow them to control us.\nAs of the date of this prospectus, members of our management team and affiliates beneficially own approximately 11.47% of our outstanding common stock. As such, management owns approximately 11.47% of our voting power. As a result, management will have the ability to control substantially all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval including:\na) election of our board of directors;\nb) removal of any of our directors;\nc) amendment of our Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws; and\nd) adoption of measures that could delay or prevent a change in control or impede a merger, takeover or other business combination involving us.\nIn addition, management\u2019s stock ownership may discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn could reduce our stock price or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over our stock price.\nAny additional investors will own a minority percentage of our common stock and will have minority voting rights.\nRisks Related to the Common Stock\nOur stock price is likely to be extremely volatile and our common stock is not listed on a stock exchange; as a result, stockholders may not be able to resell their shares at or above the price paid for them.\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to be extremely volatile and could be subject to significant fluctuations due to changes in sentiment in the market regarding our operations or business prospects, among other factors. Further, our common stock is not currently quoted or listed for trading anywhere except the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. An active public market for our common stock does not currently exist, and even if it does someday exist, it may not be sustained. Therefore, stockholders may not be able to sell their shares at or above the price they paid for them.\nAmong the factors that could affect our stock price are:\n\u25cf industry trends and the business success of our customers;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial and operating results that vary from the expectations of our management or of securities analysts and investors;\n\u25cf our failure to meet the expectations of the investment community and changes in investment community recommendations or estimates of our future operating results;\n\u25cf announcements of strategic developments, acquisitions, dispositions, financings, product developments and other materials events by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf regulatory and legislative developments concerning our technology;\n\u25cf litigation;\n\u25cf general market conditions;\n\u25cf other domestic and international macroeconomic factors unrelated to our performance; and\n\u25cf additions or departures of key personnel.\nSales by our stockholders of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nA substantial portion of our total outstanding shares of common stock may be sold into the market at any time. While most of these shares are held by our principal stockholder, who is also an executive officer, and we believe that such holder has no current intention to sell a significant number of shares of our stock, if he were to decide to sell large amounts of stock over a short period of time (presuming such sales were permitted, given his affiliate status) such sales could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nFurther, the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of the perception that such sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate\nOur preferred stock may have rights senior to those of our common stock which could adversely affect holders of common stock.\nAlthough no preferred stock has been issued, Delaware law, and our Certificate of Incorporation give our Board of Directors the authority to issue additional series of preferred stock without a vote or action by our stockholders. The Board also has the authority to determine the terms of preferred stock, including price, preferences and voting rights. The rights granted to holders of preferred stock in the future may adversely affect the rights of holders of our common stock. Any such authorized class of preferred stock may have a liquidation preference - a pre-set distribution in the event of a liquidation - that would reduce the amount available for distribution to holders of common stock or superior dividend rights that would reduce the amount of dividends that could be distributed to common stockholders. In addition, an authorized class of preferred stock may have voting rights that are superior to the voting right of the holders of our common stock. Currently the Company has no issued or outstanding preferred stock.\nWe are an smaller reporting company and, as a result of the reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to such companies, our common stock may be less attractive to investors.\nWe are a smaller reporting company, (i.e. a company with less than $75 million of its voting equity held by affiliates). , and we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies We have elected to adopt these reduced disclosure requirements. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive as a result of our taking advantage of these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of our choices, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. There is currently no active market for our common stock.\nWe do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe intend to retain our future earnings, if any, in order to reinvest in the development and growth of our business and, therefore, do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant. Accordingly, you may need to sell your shares of our common stock to realize a return on your investment, and you may not be able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid for them.\nWe can sell additional shares of common stock without consulting stockholders and without offering shares to existing stockholders, which would result in dilution of stockholders\u2019 interests in MY SIZE, INC. and could depress our stock price.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation authorizes 50,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 15,313,793 are currently outstanding, and our Board of Directors is authorized to issue additional shares of our common stock and preferred stock. Although our Board of Directors intends to utilize its reasonable business judgment to fulfill its fiduciary obligations to our then existing stockholders in connection with any future issuance of our capital stock, the future issuance of additional shares of our common stock or preferred stock convertible into common stock would cause immediate, and potentially substantial, dilution to our existing stockholders, which could also have a material effect on the market value of the shares.\nFurther, our shares do not have preemptive rights, which means we can sell shares of our common stock to other persons without offering purchasers in this offering the right to purchase their proportionate share of such offered shares. Therefore, any additional sales of stock by us could dilute your ownership interest in our Company.\nCAUTIONARY NOTE ON FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Form 10K contains certain forward- looking statements as defined by federal securities laws.
