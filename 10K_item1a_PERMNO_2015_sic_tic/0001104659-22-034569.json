{"cik": "1384195", "company": "RING ENERGY, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A:Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to various risks and uncertainties in the ordinary course of business. The following summarizes significant risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. We cannot assure you that any of the events discussed in the risk factors below will not occur. Further, the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially affect our business. Readers should carefully consider the risk factors included below as well as those matters referenced in this report under \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d and other information included and incorporated by reference into this report.\nRisks Relating to Our Business, Operations and Strategy\nPart of our strategy involves using some of the latest available horizontal drilling and completion techniques, which involve additional risks and uncertainties in their application as compared to conventional drilling.\nOur operations utilize some of the latest horizontal drilling and completion techniques as developed by us, other oil and natural gas exploration and production companies and our service providers. The additional risks that we face while drilling horizontally include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf drilling wells that are significantly longer and/or deeper than conventional wells;\n\u25cf landing our wellbore in the desired drilling zone;\n\u25cf staying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation;\n\u25cf running our casing the entire length of the wellbore; and\n\u25cf being able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal wellbore.\nRisks that we face while completing our wells include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf the ability to fracture or stimulate the planned number of stages in a horizontal or lateral wellbore;\n\u25cf the ability to run tools the entire length of the wellbore during completion operations; and\n\u25cf the ability to successfully clean out the wellbore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage.\nIf our assessments of purchased properties are materially inaccurate, it could have a significant impact on future operations and earnings.\nThe successful acquisition of producing properties requires assessments of many factors, which are inherently inexact and may be inaccurate, including the following:\n\u25cf unforeseen title issues;\n\u25cf the amount of recoverable reserves;\n\u25cf future oil and natural gas prices;\n\u25cf estimates of operating costs;\n\u25cf estimates of future development costs;\n\u25cf estimates of the costs and timing of plugging and abandonment; and\n\u25cf potential environmental and other liabilities.\nOur assessment will not reveal all existing or potential problems, nor will it permit us to become familiar enough with the properties to assess fully their capabilities and deficiencies. We plan to undertake further development of our properties through the use of cash flow from existing production. Therefore, a material deviation in our assessments of these factors could result in less cash flow being available for such purposes than we presently anticipate, which could either delay future development operations (and delay the anticipated conversion of reserves into cash) or cause us to seek alternative sources to finance development activities.\nProspects that we decide to drill may not yield oil or natural gas in commercially viable quantities.\nOur prospects are in various stages of evaluation, ranging from prospects that are currently being drilled to prospects that will require substantial additional seismic data processing and interpretation. There is no way to predict in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular prospect will yield oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to recover drilling or completion costs or to be economically viable. This risk may be enhanced in our situation, due to the fact that a significant percentage (44)% of our proved reserves is currently proved undeveloped reserves. The use of seismic data and other technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area will not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present or, if present, whether oil or natural gas will be present in commercial quantities. We cannot assure you that the analogies we draw from available data obtained by analyzing other wells, more fully explored prospects or producing fields will be applicable to our drilling prospects.\nA substantial percentage of our proved properties are undeveloped; therefore, the risk associated with our success is greater than would be the case if the majority of our properties were categorized as proved developed.\nBecause a substantial percentage of our proved properties are proved undeveloped (44)%, we will require significant additional capital to develop such properties before they may become productive. Further, because of the inherent uncertainties associated with drilling for oil and gas, some of these properties may never be developed to the extent that they result in positive cash flow. Even if we are successful in our development efforts, it could take several years for a significant portion of our undeveloped properties to be converted to positive cash flow.\nWhile our current business plan is to fund the development costs with cash flow from our other producing properties, if such cash flow is not sufficient, we may be forced to seek alternative sources for cash, through the issuance of additional equity or debt securities, increased borrowings or other means.\nHedging transactions may limit our potential gains.\nTo reduce our exposure to commodity price uncertainty and increase cash flow predictability relating to the marketing of our crude oil and natural gas, we have entered into crude oil and natural gas price hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our expected production in order to economically hedge a portion of our forecasted oil and natural gas production. Additionally, our credit facility requires us to hedge a portion of our production. In addition, these derivative contracts may limit the benefit we would otherwise receive from increases in the prices for oil and natural gas. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has in place derivative contracts covering 3,129 barrels of oil per day for the calendar year 2022. All of the 3,129 barrels of oil in 2022 are in the form of swaps of WTI Crude Oil prices. The oil swap prices for 2022 range from $44.22 to $50.05, with a weighted average swap price of $46.60.\nHedging transactions may expose us to risk of financial loss.\nWhile intended to reduce the effects of volatile crude oil and natural gas prices, such derivative contracts expose us to risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging agreement and actual prices received, or when the counterparty to the derivative contract is financially constrained and defaults on its contractual obligations. It is also possible that sales volumes fall below the hedged volumes leaving a portion of our position uncovered.\nThe transition from LIBOR to alternative reference \u201cbenchmark\u201d interest rates is uncertain and could adversely affect the value of or the interest rates on our investments and obligations indexed to LIBOR, as well as the revenue and expenses associated with those assets and obligations.\nLIBOR is an interest rate benchmark that has been widely used in financial contracts around the world for decades. In July 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d), which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) announced that it intended to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. Following discussions with the FCA and other official sector bodies, the Intercontinental Exchange Benchmark Administration announced in March 2021 the publication of certain USD LIBOR settings will continue through June 30, 2023. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee of the Federal Reserve Board (ARRC), a group of market participants convened to help ensure a successful transition away from LIBOR, has recommended the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as its preferred alternative reference rate and has proposed a transition plan and timeline designed to encourage the adoption of SOFR from LIBOR.\nWe are in the process of analyzing and identifying our population of securities, financial instruments and contracts that utilize LIBOR (collectively \u201cLIBOR Instruments\u201d) to determine if we have any material exposure to the transition from LIBOR. To the extent we hold LIBOR Instruments, the terms of these instruments may have fallback provisions that provide for an alternative reference rate when LIBOR ceases to exist. For securities without adequate fallback provisions already in place, legislation governing securities under New York law has been enacted to provide a safe harbor for transition to the recommended alternative reference rate. In addition, federal legislation has been introduced to provide the same protection for securities not governed by New York law.\nNotwithstanding, in preparation for the phase out of LIBOR, we may need to renegotiate our LIBOR Instruments that utilize\nLIBOR. However, these efforts may not be successful in mitigating the legal and financial risk from changing the reference rate in our LIBOR Instruments. Furthermore, the discontinuation of LIBOR may adversely impact our ability to manage and hedge exposures to fluctuations in interest rates using derivative instruments.\nAs a result, the transition of our LIBOR Instruments to alternative reference rates may result in adverse changes to the net investment income, fair market value and return on those investments. We intend to continue to evaluate and monitor the risks associated with the LIBOR transition which include identifying and monitoring our exposure to LIBOR, monitoring the market adoption of alternative reference rates and ensuring operational processes are updated to accommodate alternative rates. Due to uncertainty surrounding alternative rates, we are unable to predict the overall impact of this change at this time.\nWe may be adversely affected by natural disasters, pandemics (including the recent coronavirus outbreak) and other catastrophic events, and by man-made problems such as terrorism, that could disrupt our business operations.\nNatural disasters, adverse weather conditions, floods, pandemics (including the recent coronavirus outbreak), acts of terrorism and other catastrophic or geo-political events may cause damage or disruption to our operations and the global economy, or could result in market disruption, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nThe ongoing coronavirus outbreak has impacted various businesses throughout the world, including an impact on the global demand for oil and natural gas, travel restrictions and the extended shutdown of certain businesses in impacted geographic regions. If the coronavirus outbreak situation should worsen, it could have a material adverse impact on our business operations, operating results and financial condition.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and the relations of and agreements between OPEC+ producers, could disrupt our operations and adversely impact our business and financial results.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has led to worldwide shutdowns, reductions in commercial and interpersonal activity, and changes in consumer behavior. In attempting to control the spread of COVID-19, governments around the world-imposed regulations such as shelter-in-place orders, quarantines, executive orders and similar restrictions. As a result, the global economy has been marked by significant slowdown and uncertainty, which has in the past led to a precipitous decline in oil prices in response to decreased demand. We currently are unable to predict the duration or severity of the spread of COVID-19 or the adverse effects thereof.\nThe loss of key members of management or failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel could, in the future, affect the Company\u2019s business results.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends on its ability to attract, retain and motivate a highly-skilled and diverse management team and workforce. During the latter half of 2020, the Company experienced significant leadership changes, including appointing a new Chief Executive Officer, Executive Vice President of Operations, a new Executive Vice President of Engineering and Corporate Strategy, a new Vice President of Compliance, a new Executive Vice President of Land, Legal, Human Resources and Marketing along with the appointment of new directors to the Board of Directors. In the first quarter of 2021, the Company appointed a new Chief Financial Officer. Executive leadership transitions can be difficult to manage and could cause disruption to our business. Failure to ensure that the Company has the depth and breadth of management and personnel with the necessary skill set and experience could impede its ability to achieve growth objectives and execute its operational strategy. As the Company continues to expand, it will need to promote or hire additional staff, and, as a result of increased compensation and benefit mandates, it may be difficult to attract or retain such individuals without incurring significant additional costs.\nRisks Relating to the Oil and Natural Gas Industry\nA substantial or extended decline in oil and natural gas prices may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations and financial commitments.\nThe price we receive for our oil and natural gas production heavily influences our revenue, profitability, access to capital and future rate of growth. Oil and natural gas are commodities and, therefore, their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. Historically, the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile. These markets will likely continue to be volatile in the future. The prices we receive for our production, and the levels of our production, depend on numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf changes in global supply and demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf the actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC;\n\u25cf the actions of oil exporting countries that are not members of OPEC;\n\u25cf the price and quantity of imports of foreign oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf political conditions, including embargoes, in or affecting other oil-producing activity;\n\u25cf acts of war and related armed conflicts;\n\u25cf the level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production activity;\n\u25cf the level of global oil and natural gas inventories;\n\u25cf weather conditions;\n\u25cf technological advances affecting energy consumption; and\n\u25cf the price and availability of alternative fuels.\nLower oil and natural gas prices may not only decrease our revenues on a per BOE basis but also may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically. Lower prices also negatively impact the value of our proved reserves. A substantial or extended decline in oil or natural gas prices may materially and adversely affect our future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures.\nDrilling for and producing oil and natural gas are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur future success will depend on our exploitation, exploration, development and production activities. Our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to numerous risks beyond our control, including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable oil or natural gas production. For example, in January 2021, President Biden signed an Executive Order directing the Department of Interior (the \u201cDOI\u201d) to temporarily pause new oil and gas leases on federal lands and waters pending completion of a comprehensive review of the federal government\u2019s existing oil and gas leasing and permitting program. In June 2021, a federal district court enjoined the DOI from implementing the pause and leasing resumed, although litigation over the leasing pause remains ongoing. In February 2022, another judge ruled that the Biden Administration\u2019s efforts to raise the cost of climate change in its environmental assessments, would increase energy costs and damage state revenues from energy production. This ruling has cause federal agencies to delay issuing new oil and gas leases and permits on federal lands and waters. While we do not have a significant federal lands acreage position (240 net acres as of December 31, 2021), these actions could have a material adverse effect on our industry and the Company.\nOur decisions to purchase, explore, develop or otherwise exploit prospects or properties will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses, production data and engineering studies, the results of which are often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations. Please read \u201c-Reserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. . .\u201d (below) for a discussion of the uncertainty involved in these processes. Our cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain before drilling commences. Overruns in budgeted expenditures are common risks that can make a particular well or project uneconomical. Further, many factors may curtail, delay or cancel drilling, including delays imposed by or resulting from compliance with regulatory requirements; pressure or irregularities in geological formations; shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment and qualified personnel; equipment failures or accidents; adverse weather conditions; reductions in oil and natural gas prices; title problems; and limitations in the market for oil and natural gas.\nDecreases in oil and natural gas prices may require us to take write-downs of the carrying values of our oil and natural gas properties which could negatively impact the trading value of our common stock.\nAccounting rules require that we review periodically the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties for possible impairment. Based on specific market factors and circumstances at the time of prospective impairment reviews, and the continuing evaluation of development plans, production data, economics and other factors, we may be required to write-down the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties. A write-down would likely constitute a non-cash charge to earnings. The cumulative effect of a write-down could also negatively impact the trading price of our common stock.\nWe follow the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties. Under the full cost method, the net book value of properties, less related deferred income taxes, may not exceed a calculated \u201cceiling.\u201d The ceiling is the estimated after tax future net revenues from proved oil and natural gas properties, discounted at 10% per year. Discounted future net revenues are estimated using oil and natural gas spot prices based on the average price during the preceding 12-month period determined as an un-weighted, arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, except for changes which are fixed and determinable by existing contracts. The net book value is compared to the ceiling on a quarterly basis. The excess, if any, of the net book value above the ceiling is required to be written off as an impairment expense. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a non-cash write-down of $277.5 million. During the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2019, we did not incur a write-down. Under SEC full cost accounting rules, any write-off recorded may not be reversed even if higher oil and natural gas prices increase the ceiling applicable to future periods. Future price decreases could result in reductions in the carrying value of such assets and an equivalent charge to earnings.\nIt is difficult to predict with reasonable certainty the amount of any future impairments given the many factors impacting the ceiling test calculation including, but not limited to, future pricing, operating costs, upward or downward reserve revisions, reserve adds, and tax attributes.\nDecreases in oil and natural gas prices may affect our borrowing base, potentially requiring earlier than anticipated debt repayment, which could negatively impact the trading value of our common stock.\nDecreases in oil and natural gas prices could also result in reductions in the borrowing base of our Credit Facility, thus requiring earlier than anticipated repayment of debt or possible default under our Credit Facility in the event we are unable to make payments under the Credit Facility on a timely basis.\nReserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\nThe process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex. It requires interpretations of available technical data and many assumptions, including assumptions relating to economic factors. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reported reserves.\nIn order to prepare our estimates, we must project production rates and timing of development expenditures. We must also analyze available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data. The extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary. The process also requires economic assumptions about matters such as oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. Therefore, estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are inherently imprecise.\nActual future production, oil and natural gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves most likely will vary from our estimates. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reported reserves. In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nYou should not assume that the present value of future net revenues from our reported proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, we generally base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the present value estimate. If future values decline or costs increase it could negatively impact our ability to finance operations, and individual properties could cease being commercially viable, affecting our decision to continue operations on producing properties or to attempt to develop properties. All of these factors would have a negative impact on earnings and net income, and most likely the trading price of our common stock. These factors could also result in the acceleration of debt repayment and a reduction in our borrowing base under our credit facility.\nWe may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of our oil and natural gas operations.\nWe are not insured against all risks. Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured and underinsured events could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil and natural gas, including the possibility of:\n\u25cf environmental hazards, such as uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, brine, well fluids, toxic gas or other pollution into the environment, including groundwater and shoreline contamination;\n\u25cf abnormally pressured formations;\n\u25cf mechanical difficulties, such as stuck oil field drilling and service tools and casing collapse;\n\u25cf fires and explosions;\n\u25cf personal injuries and death; and\n\u25cf natural disasters.\nAny of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial losses to our Company. We may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. If a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance, then it could materially and adversely affect us.\nUnless we replace our oil and natural gas reserves, our reserves and production will decline as reserves are produced.\nUnless we conduct successful development, exploitation and exploration activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, our proved reserves will decline as those reserves are produced. Producing oil and natural gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Our future oil and natural gas reserves and production, and, therefore, our cash flow and income, are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing and exploiting our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. If we are unable to develop, exploit, find or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production, our cash flow and income will decline as production declines, until our existing properties would be incapable of sustaining commercial production.\nCompetition is intense in the oil and natural gas industry.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties and marketing oil and natural gas. Our competitors include multinational oil and natural gas companies, major oil and natural gas companies, independent oil and natural gas companies, individual producers, financial buyers as well as participants in other industries that supply energy and fuel to consumers. Many of our competitors have greater and more diverse resources than we do. Additionally, competition for acquisitions may significantly increase the cost of available properties. We compete for the personnel and equipment required to explore, develop and operate properties. Our competitors also may have established long-term strategic positions and relationships in areas in which we may seek to enter. Consequently, our competitors may be able to address these competitive factors more effectively than we can. If we are not successful in our competition for oil and natural gas reserves or in our marketing of production, then our financial condition and operation results may be adversely affected.\nIf our access to markets is restricted, it could negatively impact our production, our income and our ability to retain our leases.\nMarket conditions or the unavailability of satisfactory oil and natural gas transportation arrangements may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production. The availability of a ready market for our oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors, including the demand for and supply of oil and natural gas and the proximity of reserves to pipelines and terminal facilities. Our ability to market our production depends in substantial part on the availability and capacity of gathering systems, pipelines\nand processing facilities owned and operated by third parties. Our failure to obtain such services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business.\nCurrently, the majority of our production is sold to marketers and other purchasers that have access to nearby pipeline facilities. However, as we further develop our properties, we may find production in areas with limited or no access to pipelines, thereby necessitating delivery by other means, such as trucking or requiring compression facilities. Such restrictions on our ability to sell our oil or natural gas could have several adverse effects, including higher transportation costs, fewer potential purchasers (thereby potentially resulting in a lower selling price) or, in the event we were unable to market and sustain production from a particular lease for an extended time, possibly causing us to lose a lease due to lack of production.\nMany of our properties are in areas that may have been partially depleted or drained by offset wells and certain of our wells may be adversely affected by actions we or other operators may take when drilling, completing, or operating wells that we or they own.\nMany of our properties are in reservoirs that may have already been partially depleted or drained by earlier offset drilling. The owners of leasehold interests adjoining any of our properties could take actions, such as drilling and completing additional wells, which could adversely affect our operations. When a new well is completed and produced, the pressure differential in the vicinity of the well causes the migration of reservoir fluids toward the new wellbore (and potentially away from existing wellbores). As a result, the drilling and production of these potential locations by us or other operators could cause depletion of our proved reserves and may inhibit our ability to further develop our proved reserves. In addition, completion operations and other activities conducted on adjacent or nearby wells by us or other operators could cause production from our wells to be shut in for indefinite periods of time, could result in increased lease operating expenses and could adversely affect the production and reserves from our wells after they re-commence production. We have no control over the operations or activities of offsetting operators.\nMulti-well pad drilling may result in volatility in our operating results.\nWe utilize multi-well pad drilling where practical. Because wells drilled on a pad are not brought into production until all wells on the pad are drilled and completed and the drilling rig is moved from the location, multi-well pad drilling delays the commencement of production from a given pad, which may cause volatility in our operating results. In addition, problems affecting one pad could adversely affect production from all wells on such pad. As a result, multi-well pad drilling can cause delays in the scheduled commencement of production or interruptions in ongoing production.\nExtreme weather conditions, which could become more frequent or severe due to climate change, could adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling, completion and production activities in the areas where we operate.\nOur exploitation and development activities and equipment could be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes or freezing temperatures, which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity from regional power outages or lost or damaged facilities and equipment. Such extreme weather conditions could also impact access to our drilling and production facilities for routine operations, maintenance and repairs and the availability of and our access to, necessary third-party services, such as gathering, processing, compression and transportation services. These constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay or temporarily halt our operations and materially increase our operation and capital costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRestrictions on drilling activities intended to protect certain species of wildlife may adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate.\nOil and natural gas operations in our operating areas can be adversely affected by seasonal or permanent restrictions on drilling activities designed to protect certain wildlife, such as those restrictions imposed under The Endangered Species Act. Seasonal restrictions may limit our ability to operate in protected areas and can intensify competition for drilling rigs, oilfield equipment, services, supplies and qualified personnel, which may lead to periodic shortages when drilling is allowed. These constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs. Permanent restrictions imposed to protect endangered species could prohibit drilling in certain areas or require the implementation of expensive mitigation measures. The designation of previously unprotected species in areas where we operate as threatened or endangered could cause us to incur increased\ncosts arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our exploration, development and production activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce our reserves.\nOur operations are substantially dependent on the availability, use and disposal of water. New legislation and regulatory initiatives or restrictions relating to water disposal wells could have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nWater is an essential component of our drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. If we are unable to obtain water to use in our operations from local sources, we may be unable to economically produce oil, natural gas and NGLs, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Wastewaters from our operations typically are disposed of via underground injection. Some studies have linked earthquakes in certain areas to underground injection, which is leading to greater public scrutiny of disposal wells. Any new environmental initiatives or regulations that restrict injection of fluids, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of oil and gas, or that limit the withdrawal, storage or use of surface water or ground water necessary for hydraulic fracturing of our wells, could increase our operating costs and cause delays, interruptions or cessation of our operations, the extent of which cannot be predicted, and all of which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Relating to Legal, Regulatory, Privacy and Tax Matters\nWe are subject to complex laws that can affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.\nExploration, development, production and sale of oil and natural gas are subject to extensive federal, state, local and international regulation. It is not possible to predict how or when regulations affecting our operations might change. In January 2021, President Biden signed an Executive Order directing the Department of Interior (the \u201cDOI\u201d) to temporarily pause new oil and gas leases on federal lands and waters pending completion of a comprehensive review of the federal government\u2019s existing oil and gas leasing and permitting program. In June 2021, a federal district court enjoined the DOI from implementing the pause and leasing resumed, although litigation over the leasing pause remains ongoing. In February 2022, another judge ruled that the Biden Administration\u2019s efforts to raise the cost of climate change in its environmental assessments, would increase energy costs and damage state revenues from energy production. This ruling has caused federal agencies to delay issuing new oil and gas leases and permits on federal lands and waters. Similarly, at the state level, New Mexico\u2019s consideration of legislation to prohibit certain uses of freshwater in fracking operations, implement new disclosure requirements, and increase penalties may affect the cost and feasibility of our business. We may be required to make large expenditures to comply with governmental regulations. Other matters subject to regulation include: discharge permits for drilling operations; drilling bonds; reports concerning operations; the spacing of wells; unitization and pooling of properties; and taxation.\nUnder these laws, we could be liable for personal injuries, property damage and other damages. Failure to comply with these laws also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties. Moreover, these laws could change in ways that substantially increase our costs. Any such liabilities, penalties, suspensions, terminations or regulatory changes could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations may incur substantial liabilities to comply with the environmental laws and regulations.\nOur oil and natural gas operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the release or disposal of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences, restrict the types, quantities and concentration of substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities, limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas, and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, incurrence of investigatory or remedial obligations or the imposition of injunctive relief. Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent or costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to maintain compliance and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, competitive position or financial condition as well as the industry in general. Under these environmental laws and regulations, we could be held strictly liable for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination regardless of whether we were responsible for the release or if our operations were standard in the industry at the time they were\nperformed. The amount of additional future costs is not fully determinable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions or compliance efforts that may be required, the determination of the Company\u2019s liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from third parties.\nOur operations are subject to a series of risks arising out of the threat of climate change that could result in increased operating costs, limit the areas in which we may conduct oil and natural gas exploration and production activities, and reduce demand for the oil and natural gas we produce.\nIn the United States, no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented at the federal level. However, following the U.S. Supreme Court finding that GHG emissions constitute a pollutant under the CAA, the EPA has adopted regulations that, among other things, establish construction and operating permit reviews for emissions from certain large stationary sources, require the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas system sources in the United States, and together with the DOT, implement GHG emissions limits on vehicles manufactured for operation in the United States. The federal regulation of methane from oil and gas facilities has been subject to uncertainty in recent years. In September 2020, the Trump Administration revised prior regulations to rescind certain methane standards and remove the transmission and storage segments from the source category for certain regulations. However, shortly after taking office, President Biden issued an executive order directing all federal agencies to review and take action to address any federal regulations, orders, guidance documents, policies and similar agency actions promulgated during the prior administration that may be inconsistent with the current administration\u2019s policies. In response, the U.S. Congress has approved, and President Biden has signed into law, a resolution under the Congressional Review Act to repeal the September 2020 revisions to the methane standards, effectively reinstating the prior standards. In November 2021, as required by President Biden\u2019s executive order, the EPA proposed new regulations to establish comprehensive standards of performance and emission guidelines for methane and volatile organic compound emissions from existing operations in the oil and gas sector, including the exploration and production, transmission, processing, and storage segments. The EPA is currently seeking public comments on its proposal, which the EPA hopes to finalize by the end of 2022. Once finalized, the regulations will also need to be incorporated in state implementation plans and approved by EPA. However, all of these regulatory actions will likely be subject to legal challenges. As a result, we cannot predict the scope of any final methane regulatory requirements or the cost to comply with such requirements. However, given the long-term trend toward increasing regulation, future federal GHG regulations of the oil and gas industry remain a significant possibility.\nGovernmental, scientific, and public concern over the threat of climate change arising from GHG emissions has resulted in increasing political risks in the United States, including climate change related pledges made by certain candidates elected to public office. President Biden has issued several executive orders focused on addressing climate change, including items that may impact our costs to produce, or demand for, oil and gas. Additionally, in November 2021, the Biden Administration released \u201cThe Long-Term Strategy of the United States: Pathways to Net-Zero Greenhouse Gas Emissions by 2050,\u201d which establishes a roadmap to net zero emissions in the United States by 2050 through, among other things, improving energy efficiency; decarbonizing energy sources via electricity, hydrogen, and sustainable biofuels; and reducing non-CO2 GHG emissions, such as methane and nitrous oxide. The Biden Administration is also considering revisions to the leasing and permitting programs for oil and gas development on federal lands. Litigation risks are also increasing, as a number of entities have sought to bring suit against oil and natural gas companies in state or federal court, alleging, among other things, that such companies created public nuisances by producing fuels that contributed to climate change. Suits have also been brought against such companies under shareholder and consumer protection laws, alleging that companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change but failed to adequately disclose those impacts.\nThere are also increasing financial risks for fossil fuel producers as shareholders currently invested in fossil-fuel energy companies may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investments into other sectors. Institutional lenders who provide financing to fossil-fuel energy companies also have become more attentive to sustainable lending practices and some of them may elect not to provide funding for fossil fuel energy companies. For example, at COP26, the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (\u201cGFANZ\u201d) announced that commitments from over 450 firms across 45 countries had resulted in over $130 trillion in capital committed to net zero goals. The various sub-alliances of GFANZ generally require participants to set short-term, sector-specific targets to transition their financing, investing, and/or underwriting activities to net zero emissions by 2050. There is also a risk that financial institutions will be required to adopt policies that have the effect of reducing the funding provided to the fossil fuel sector. President Biden signed an executive order calling for the development of a \u201cclimate finance plan\u201d and, separately, the Federal Reserve has joined the Network for Greening the Financial System (\u201cNGFS\u201d), a consortium of financial regulators focused on addressing climate-related risks in the financial sector. More recently, in November 2021, the Federal Reserve issued a statement in support of the efforts of the NGFS to\nidentify key issues and potential solutions for the climate-related challenges most relevant to central banks and supervisory authorities. Limitation of investments in and financings for fossil fuel energy companies could result in the restriction, delay or cancellation of drilling programs or development or production activities.\nThe adoption and implementation of new or more stringent international, federal or state legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that impose more stringent standards for GHG emissions from the oil and natural gas sector or otherwise restrict the areas in which this sector may produce oil and natural gas or generate GHG emissions could result in increased costs of compliance or costs of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, oil and natural gas. Additionally, political, litigation and financial risks may result in us restricting or cancelling production activities, incurring liability for infrastructure damages as a result of climatic changes, or having an impaired ability to continue to operate in an economic manner. One or more of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a final note, climate change could have an effect on the severity of weather (including hurricanes, droughts and floods), sea levels, the arability of farmland, water availability and quality, and meteorological patterns. If such effects were to occur, our development and production operations have the potential to be adversely affected.\nPotential adverse effects could include damages to our facilities from powerful winds, extreme temperatures, or rising waters in low lying areas, disruption of our production activities either because of climate related damages to our facilities or in our costs of operation potentially arising from such climatic effects, less efficient or non- routine operating practices necessitated by climate effects or increased costs for insurance coverage in the aftermath of such effects. Significant physical effects of climate change could also have an indirect effect on our financing and operations by disrupting the transportation or process-related services provided by midstream companies, service companies or suppliers with whom we have a business relationship. Additionally, changing meteorological conditions, particularly temperature, may result in changes to the amount, timing, or location of demand for energy or the products we produce. We may not be able to recover through insurance some or any of the damages, losses or costs that may result from potential physical effects of climate change. At this time, we have not developed a comprehensive plan to address the legal, economic, social or physical impacts of climate change on our operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Capital Structure\nIf our indebtedness increases, it could reduce our financial flexibility.\nWe have a credit facility in place with $350 million in commitments for borrowings and letters of credit. As of December 31, 2021, $290 million was outstanding on our credit facility. If we further utilize this facility, the level of our indebtedness could affect our operations in several ways, including the following:\n\u25cf a significant portion of our cash flow could be used to service the indebtedness;\n\u25cf a high level of debt would increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u25cf the covenants contained in our credit facility limit our ability to borrow additional funds, dispose of assets, pay dividends and make certain investments, and;\n\u25cf a high level of debt could impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes.\nIn addition, our bank borrowing base is subject to semi-annual redeterminations. We could be required to repay a portion of our bank borrowings due to redeterminations of our borrowing base. If we are required to do so, we may not have sufficient funds to make such repayments, and we may need to negotiate renewals of our borrowings or arrange new financing or sell significant assets. Any such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nWe may be unable to access the equity or debt capital markets to meet our obligations.\nOur plans for growth may include accessing the capital markets. Recent reluctance to invest in the exploration and production sector based on market volatility, historically perceived underperformance, and Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) trends, among other things, has raised concerns regarding capital availability for the sector. If those markets are unavailable, or if we are unable to access alternative means of financing on acceptable terms, we may be unable to implement all of our development plans, make acquisitions or otherwise carry out our business strategy, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to service our indebtedness.\nRisks Relating to Technology and Cybersecurity\nWe rely on computer and telecommunications systems, and failures in our systems or cyber security attacks or breaches could result in information theft, data corruption, disruption in operations and/or financial loss.\nThe oil and natural gas industry has become increasingly dependent upon digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations including certain exploration, development and production activities. We depend on digital technology to estimate quantities of oil and natural gas reserves, process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information, process and store personally identifiable information on our employees and royalty owners and communicate with our employees and other third parties. Our business partners, including vendors, service providers, purchasers of our production and financial institutions, are also dependent on digital technology. It is possible that we could incur interruptions from cyber security attacks or breaches, computer viruses or malware that could result in disruption of our business operations and/or financial loss. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and protect against these threats and mitigate our exposure to such threats, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient in preventing security threats from materializing and causing us to suffer losses in the future. Even so, any cyber incidents or interruptions to our computing and communications infrastructure or our information systems could lead to data corruption, communication interruption, unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse or destruction of proprietary or other information, or otherwise significantly disrupt our business operations. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile, which could cause the value of your investment to decline.\nThe stock markets have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. The market price of our common stock may also fluctuate significantly in response to the following factors, some of which are beyond our control:\n\u25cf our operating and financial performance and prospects;\n\u25cf variations in our quarterly operating results and changes in our liquidity position;\n\u25cf investor perceptions of us and the industry and markets in which we operate;\n\u25cf future sales, or the availability for sale, of equity or equity-related securities;\n\u25cf changes in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial performance;\n\u25cf changes in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u25cf changes in the price of oil and natural gas; and\n\u25cf general financial, domestic, economic and other market conditions.\nWe have no current plans to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe do not currently anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to pay down debt and finance the expansion of our business. Our future dividend policy is within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon various factors, including our business, financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and investment opportunities. In addition, our credit facility currently prohibits us from paying dividends.\nOur Board of Directors can, without stockholder approval, cause preferred stock to be issued on terms that could adversely affect common stockholders.\nUnder our Articles of Incorporation, our Board of Directors is authorized to issue up to 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which none are issued and outstanding as of the date of this Annual Report. Also, our Board of Directors, without stockholder approval, may determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting rights, of those shares. If the Board of Directors causes shares of preferred stock to be issued, the rights of the holders of our common stock could be adversely affected. The Board of Director\u2019s ability to determine the terms of preferred stock and to cause its issuance, while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. Preferred shares issued by the Board of Directors could include voting rights, or even super voting rights, which could shift the ability to control the Company to the holders of the preferred stock. Preferred shares could also have conversion rights into shares of common stock at a discount to the market price of the common stock which could negatively affect the market for our common stock. In addition, preferred shares would typically have preference in the event of liquidation of the Company, which means that the holders of preferred shares would be entitled to receive the net assets of the Company distributed in liquidation before the common stockholders receive any distribution of the liquidated assets. We have no current plans to issue any shares of preferred stock.\nProvisions under Nevada law could delay or prevent a change in control of our company, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nIn addition to the ability of the Board of Directors to issue preferred stock, the existence of some provisions under Nevada law could delay or prevent a change in control of the Company, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock. Nevada law imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 10% or more of our outstanding common stock.", "PERMNO": 14137, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "REI"}
