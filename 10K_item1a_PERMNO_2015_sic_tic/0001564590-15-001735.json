{"cik": "1454189", "company": "Auspex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-16", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRisk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as the other information in this report, and in our other public filings. The occurrence of any of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or growth prospects or cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements we have made in this report and those we may make from time to time. You should consider all of the risk factors described when evaluating our business.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe are highly dependent on the success of SD-809, which is still in clinical development, and we may not be able to successfully obtain regulatory or marketing approval for, or successfully commercialize, this product candidate in any of the indications for which we plan to develop it, which include chorea associated with Huntington\u2019s disease, tardive dyskinesia and Tourette syndrome.\nOur future success will depend almost entirely on our ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and then successfully commercialize SD-809, our lead program, in the United States, which may never occur. We have no significant product candidates beyond Phase 1 clinical trials, in our clinical development pipeline other than SD-809. We currently generate no revenues from sales of any drugs and we may never be able to develop or commercialize a marketable drug.\nAlthough we have successfully completed a Phase 3 clinical trial of SD-809 in patients having chorea associated with Huntington\u2019s disease and plan to submit a New Drug Application, or NDA, filing based on the desirable Phase 3 data, we cannot be certain that we will obtain regulatory approval, and even if we do, there can be no assurance that the approval process will not be lengthy. Also, before we can market and sell SD-809 in the United States or foreign jurisdictions, we may need to commence and complete additional clinical trials, and will need to manage clinical, preclinical, and manufacturing activities, obtain necessary regulatory approvals from the FDA in the United States and from similar foreign regulatory agencies in other jurisdictions, obtain manufacturing supply, build a commercial organization or enter into a marketing collaboration with a third party, and in some jurisdictions, obtain reimbursement authorization, among other things. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully complete the necessary clinical trials and/or obtain regulatory approvals and develop sufficient commercial capabilities for SD-809. We have not submitted a NDA to the FDA or similar drug approval filings to comparable foreign authorities, for any product candidate. Further, SD-809 may not receive regulatory approval even if it is successful in clinical trials. If we do not receive regulatory approvals, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected. Even if we obtain regulatory approvals, we may never generate significant revenues from any commercial sales of SD-809. If SD-809 is approved and we fail to successfully commercialize it, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenues to sustain and grow our business and our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to obtain FDA approval of SD-809 in any of the indications for which we plan to develop it, which include chorea associated with Huntington\u2019s disease, tardive dyskinesia or Tourette syndrome, or any future product candidates, we will not be able to commercialize them in the United States and our business will be adversely impacted.\nIf we fail to obtain FDA approval for SD-809 or any future product candidates, we will be unable to market or sell such products in the United States, which will significantly impair our ability to generate any revenues. The clinical development of product candidates is subject to extensive regulation by the FDA in the United States and by comparable regulatory authorities in foreign markets. Product development is a very lengthy and expensive process, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. The product development timeline can vary significantly based upon the product candidate\u2019s novelty and complexity.\nThis regulatory review and approval process, which includes evaluation of preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates as well as the evaluation of our manufacturing processes and our third-party contract manufacturers\u2019 facilities, is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. To receive approval, we must, among other things, demonstrate with substantial evidence from clinical trials that the product candidate is both safe and effective for each indication for which approval is sought, and failure can occur in any stage of development. Satisfaction of the approval requirements typically takes many years and the time needed to satisfy them may vary substantially, based on the type, complexity and novelty of the pharmaceutical product. As part of the U.S. Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the FDA has a goal to review and act on a percentage of all submissions in a given time frame. The general review goal for a drug application is ten to twelve months for a Standard Review application and six to eight months for a Priority Review application, depending on whether the drug at issue is a new molecular entity. Priority Review designation is given to drugs that offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The FDA\u2019s review goals are subject to change, and it is unknown whether the review of our NDA for SD-809, or an NDA filing for any of our other product candidates, will be completed within the FDA\u2019s review goals or will be delayed. Moreover, the duration of the FDA\u2019s review may depend on the number and types of other NDAs that are submitted to the FDA around the same time period. We cannot predict if, or when, we might receive regulatory approvals for SD-809 or any future product candidates. We intend to seek, where appropriate, Priority Review for our drug candidates but cannot be certain that we will obtain Priority Review, and even if we do, there can be no assurance that the approval process will not be lengthy. Moreover, any approvals that we obtain may contain significant limitations in the form of narrow indications, warnings, precautions or contra-indications with respect to conditions of use, or require as a condition of approval a REMS to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks. In such event, our ability to generate revenues from such products could be greatly reduced and our business could be harmed.\nThe FDA has substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to consider our application for substantive review or may form the opinion after review of our data that our application contains deficiencies that prevent approval of a product candidate. If the FDA does not consider or approve our application, it may require that we conduct additional clinical, preclinical or manufacturing validation studies and submit that data before it will reconsider our application. Depending on the extent of these or any other studies, approval of any applications that we submit may be delayed or never approved, or may require us to expend more resources than we have available. It is also possible that additional studies, if performed and completed, may not be successful or considered sufficient by the FDA to support approval. If any of these outcomes occur, we may be forced to abandon one or more of our applications for approval, which might significantly harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities can delay, limit, or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons, including:\n\u00b7\nsuch authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nwe may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or other regulatory authorities that a product candidate is safe and effective for any indication;\n\u00b7\nsuch authorities may not accept clinical data from trials which are conducted at clinical facilities or in countries where the standard of care is potentially different from the United States;\n\u00b7\nwe may be unable to demonstrate that a product candidate\u2019s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;\n\u00b7\nsuch authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nthe results of our clinical trials may not demonstrate the safety or efficacy required by such authorities for approval;\n\u00b7\nsuch authorities may find deficiencies in the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical and commercial supplies; and\n\u00b7\nthe approval policies or regulations of such authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.\nEven if we do receive regulatory approval to market a product candidate, any such approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which we may market the product. It is possible that SD-809 and any of the product candidates we may seek to develop in the future may never obtain the appropriate regulatory approvals necessary for us to commence product sales. Any delay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, applicable regulatory approvals would prevent us from commercializing our product candidates, generating revenues and achieving and sustaining profitability.\nClinical development is a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome. Because the results of early clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, SD-809 may not have favorable results in ongoing or later clinical trials or receive regulatory approval.\nClinical development is expensive, takes many years to complete and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process and SD-809 is subject to the risks of failure inherent in drug development. Success in early clinical trials does not mean that later clinical trials will be successful. Product candidates in later-stage clinical trials may fail to demonstrate sufficient safety or efficacy despite having progressed through initial clinical trials, even at statistically significant levels. Companies frequently suffer significant setbacks in late-stage clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, even after earlier clinical trials have shown promising results. Our ongoing and future clinical trials may not be successful.\nThe planned, ongoing and recently completed clinical trials of SD-809 may not be appropriately designed to support submission of an NDA to the FDA or demonstrate safety or efficacy at the level required by the FDA for product approval.\nIn December 2014, we announced positive topline results from our First-HD trial, a placebo-controlled trial of SD-809 in 90 patients with chorea associated with Huntington\u2019s disease and our ARC-HD Switch trial where patients with chorea associated with Huntington\u2019s disease on stable doses of tetrabenazine were switched overnight to SD-809 (at about half the tetrabenazine dose) and monitored for safety and efficacy for eight weeks, with an analysis at one, four and eight weeks. Patients from First-HD and ARC-HD Switch are eligible to roll into our ARC-HD Rollover trial, which is a long-term safety study. These trials are being conducted at sites in the United States, Canada and Australia.\nWe have also initiated two clinical trials for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia that are being conducted at sites in the United States and Europe. The first trial, referred to as ARM-TD, is a placebo-controlled trial of SD-809 in approximately 90 patients with tardive dyskinesia and we expect to announce topline data from this trial in mid-2015. The second trial, referred to as AIM-TD, is a placebo-controlled trial of SD-809 in approximately 200 patients with tardive dyskinesia and we expect to announce topline data from this trial in 2016. In addition to the Huntington\u2019s disease and tardive dyskinesia programs, we initiated an open-label preliminary efficacy, pharmacokinetic and safety Phase 1b clinical trial for the treatment of tics associated with Tourette syndrome. We plan to enroll approximately 20 subjects to evaluate preliminary efficacy and safety, in addition to studying the pharmacokinetics of SD-809 in adolescents. These additional data are expected to further support the dosing assumptions and design elements of a randomized, controlled trial in this patient population and accelerate the development of SD-809 in this indication. We plan to announce topline data from this trial by mid-2015.\nAlthough we achieved positive results on the endpoints from our First-HD and ARC-HD Switch clinical trials, and even if we achieve positive results from our other ongoing or any future clinical trials, the FDA may disagree that the clinical trials are adequate to show safety or efficacy in the indication being sought or with our interpretation of the data and deem the results insufficient to demonstrate efficacy at the level required by the FDA for product approval. While we do not have any current plans to do so, it is possible that we may make modifications to the clinical trial protocols or designs of one or more of our ongoing clinical trials that delay enrollment or completion of such clinical trials and could delay regulatory approval of SD-809. Any failure to obtain approval for SD-809 on the timeline that we currently anticipate, or at all, would have a material and adverse impact on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the FDA does not conclude that SD-809 satisfies the requirements for the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory approval pathway, or if the requirements for approval of SD-809 under Section 505(b)(2) are not as we expect, the development and approval of SD-809 will likely take significantly longer, cost significantly more and entail significantly greater complexity and risks than anticipated, and in any case may not be successful.\nWe intend to seek FDA approval through the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for SD-809. Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. In the case of SD-809, we intend to file a Section 505(b)(2) NDA that relies on certain of the FDA\u2019s prior findings of safety for the approved drug, tetrabenazine (marketed as Xenazine in the United States). Our ability to rely on certain of the FDA\u2019s safety findings with regard to tetrabenazine will depend on our ability to demonstrate to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction that the dose range of SD-809 employed in our Phase 3 program exposes patients to similar levels of key active metabolites as the approved dose range of tetrabenazine. In our initial Phase 1 clinical trial, the sum of two key metabolites more than doubled at an equi-milligram dose of SD-809 as tetrabenazine, indicating that SD-809 exposes patients to similar levels of active metabolites at half the dose of tetrabenazine. Even with such a showing, the FDA has indicated that controlled safety data for SD-809 is required. We have generated such controlled safety data for SD-809 in our First-HD trial, however there can be no assurance that the FDA will be satisfied with these data. With regard to efficacy, our First-HD trial is similar in design to the successful tetrabenazine clinical trial that, along with the confirmatory evidence from a second, failed clinical trial, provided the basis for the finding of efficacy of tetrabenazine. We have not discussed with the FDA specifically whether our First-HD trial alone is adequate to establish the efficacy of SD-809. We expect to discuss this matter along with the topline positive results from the First-HD trial at a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA; however, we can provide no assurance that the FDA will not require additional clinical trials of SD-809.\nBy pursuing the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for SD-809, our reliance on the prior findings of safety for Xenazine may require any approved labeling for SD-809 to include certain safety information that is included in the labeling of Xenazine. For example, we have completed a thorough QT study of SD-809 in healthy subjects to further evaluate the potential effect of SD-809 on cardiac repolarization, specifically the QT-interval, and although the results are desirable, the trial design was not discussed with FDA and it is possible that the labeling for SD-809, if approved, may contain information pertaining to the Xenazine QT interval. Topline results from this thorough QT study demonstrated that at two different dose levels, SD-809 had no clinically significant effect on cardiac repolarization as assessed by the QT interval. A tetrabenazine arm was included for comparison and demonstrated an increase in QTc that is consistent with the effect reported in the FDA labeling for Xenazine. The clinical trial\u2019s assay sensitivity was established by the observation of characteristic QTc prolongation following dosing with moxifloxacin. If the FDA disagrees with our position that reliance on the safety data for Xenazine is appropriate, or if the data required for approval of our Section 505(b)(2) NDA are different than anticipated, we may need to conduct additional clinical trials, provide additional data and information, and meet additional standards for regulatory approval. If this were to occur, the time and financial resources required to obtain FDA approval for SD-809 would likely substantially increase. Moreover, the inability to pursue the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway could result in new competitive products reaching the market faster than SD-809, which could materially adversely impact our competitive position and prospects. Even if the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway is deemed appropriate for a product candidate, we cannot assure you that we will receive the requisite or timely approvals for commercialization of such product candidate.\nIn addition, we expect that our competitors may file citizens\u2019 petitions with the FDA in an attempt to persuade the FDA that our products, or the clinical trials that support their approval, contain deficiencies. Such actions by our competitors could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any NDA that we submit under Section 505(b)(2).\nSD-809 or our other product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that may delay or prevent their regulatory approval or commercialization or limit their commercial potential.\nUndesirable side effects caused by SD-809 or our other product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay, suspend or terminate clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of marketing approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. This, in turn, could limit or prevent us from commercializing SD-809, or our other product candidates, and generating revenues from their sale. While the topline data from the First-HD and ARC-HD Switch clinical trials showed a desirable safety and tolerability profile with low rates of adverse events, such as depression, somnolence, akathisia and anxiety, the most common adverse events observed in patients who received SD-809 were insomnia, somnolence, fatigue, diarrhea, irritability and dry mouth. In First-HD, there was one patient with two serious adverse events (cholecystitis and agitated depression) in the SD-809 group, and one patient with one serious adverse event (exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD) in the placebo group. The same patient experiencing the serious adverse events in the SD-809 group also reported suicidal ideation, which was not considered a serious adverse event. In ARC-HD Switch, one patient was hospitalized for pneumonia and another patient was hospitalized overnight for dehydration. Neither of these adverse events was considered related to study medication and both of these events resolved. In the ongoing open label ARC-HD Rollover trial, which is not a placebo controlled trial, one patient was briefly hospitalized as a precaution for worsening anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation, events considered possibly related to study medication. Another subject developed depression and suicidal ideation, events considered possibly related to study medication. A third subject was briefly hospitalized for dehydration and confusion, events considered not related to study medication. All of these adverse events resolved. Results from our ongoing or future clinical trials could reveal a high and unacceptable severity and prevalence of these or other side effects. In such an event, our trials could be suspended or terminated and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of or deny approval of SD-809 or our other product candidates for their targeted indications. Further, such side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial or result in potential product liability claims. Any of these occurrences may have a material and adverse impact on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, if SD-809 or any of our other product candidates receives marketing approval and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by such product candidate, a number of significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u00b7\nthe FDA may withdraw its approval of such product candidate;\n\u00b7\nthe FDA may require that we demonstrate a larger clinical benefit by conducting additional clinical trials for approval to offset the risk;\n\u00b7\nthe FDA may require the addition of labeling statements or warnings that could diminish the usage of the product or otherwise limit the commercial success of such product candidate;\n\u00b7\nthe FDA may make the requirements of any REMS more restrictive;\n\u00b7\nwe may be required to change the way such product candidate is administered;\n\u00b7\nwe may choose to recall, withdraw or discontinue sale of such product candidate;\n\u00b7\nwe could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and\n\u00b7\nour reputation may suffer.\nAny one or a combination of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product candidate or could substantially increase the costs and expenses of commercializing such product candidate, which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating any revenues from the sale of the product, which could significantly harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe anticipate that SD-809 will require a REMS which could delay the approval of SD-809 and increase the cost, burden and liability associated with the commercialization of SD-809.\nThe FDA Amendments Act of 2007 implemented safety-related changes to product labeling and provided the FDA with expanded authority to require the adoption of a REMS to assure safe use of the product candidates, either as a condition of product candidate approval or on the basis of new safety information. Given that tetrabenazine is subject to a REMS, we anticipate that approval of SD-809, if obtained, will be conditioned on the requirement to implement a REMS, and it is possible that our other product candidates may require a REMS. The REMS may include, among other things, medication guides for patients, special communication plans to health care professionals or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and/or other risk minimization tools. We cannot predict the specific REMS to be required as part of the FDA\u2019s approval of our product candidates. While the topline data from the First-HD and ARC-HD Switch clinical trials showed a desirable safety and tolerability profile with low rates of depression, somnolence, akathisia, anxiety and suicidal ideation, the most common adverse events observed in patients who received SD-809 were insomnia, somnolence, fatigue, diarrhea, irritability and dry mouth. In First-HD, there was one patient with two serious adverse events (cholecystitis and agitated depression) in the SD-809 group, and one patient with one serious adverse event (exacerbation of COPD) in the placebo group. The same patient experiencing the serious adverse events in the SD-809 group also reported suicidal ideation, which was not considered a serious adverse event. In ARC-HD Switch, one patient was hospitalized for pneumonia and another patient was hospitalized overnight for dehydration. Neither of these adverse events was considered related to study medication and both of these events resolved. In the ongoing open label ARC-HD Rollover trial which is not a placebo controlled trial, one patient was briefly hospitalized as a precaution for worsening anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation, events considered possibly related to study medication. Another subject developed depression and suicidal ideation, events considered possibly related to study medication. A third subject was briefly hospitalized for dehydration and confusion, events considered not related to study medication. All of these adverse events resolved. We would likely expect the elements of the REMS for SD-809, if approved, to be similar to the REMS for tetrabenazine, which includes a communication plan to healthcare providers to provide information about the increased risk of drug-associated depression and suicidality, proper titration and dosing, and the risk of drug-drug interactions with strong CYP2D6 inhibitors in patients taking the drug and the need to test for CYP2D6 enzyme activity. Any limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of our product candidates, if approved. Depending on the extent of the REMS requirements, these requirements may significantly increase our costs to commercialize these product candidates. Furthermore, risks of our product candidates that are not adequately addressed through proposed REMS for such product candidates may also prevent or delay their approval for commercialization.\nWe may experience delays in the commencement or completion of our clinical trials, which could result in increased costs to us and delay our ability to pursue regulatory approval and generate product revenues.\nDelays in the commencement or completion of clinical trials could significantly impact our product development costs and could result in the need for additional financing. We do not know whether our ongoing and planned clinical trials of SD-809 will be completed on time, or at all, or whether any clinical trials will need to be redesigned, enroll patients on time or be completed on schedule, if at all. The commencement or completion of clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including delays in or related to:\n\u00b7\nraising sufficient capital to fund the clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nobtaining regulatory feedback on trial design necessary, to commence a clinical trial;\n\u00b7\nidentifying, recruiting and training suitable clinical investigators;\n\u00b7\nidentifying, recruiting and enrolling suitable patients to participate in a clinical trial;\n\u00b7\nreaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and clinical trial sites;\n\u00b7\nobtaining sufficient quantities of drug product for use in clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nobtaining IRB approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site;\n\u00b7\nadding new clinical trial sites;\n\u00b7\nclinical trial sites deviating from trial protocol or dropping out of a trial;\n\u00b7\nfailure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols;\n\u00b7\nfailure to demonstrate a benefit from using a drug, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions;\n\u00b7\nunforeseen safety issues or any determination that a clinical trial presents unacceptable health risks;\n\u00b7\nretaining patients who have initiated a clinical trial but may withdraw due to adverse side effects from the therapy, insufficient efficacy, fatigue with the clinical trial process or personal issues; and\n\u00b7\ncatastrophic loss of drug product due to shipping delays or delays in customs in connection with delivery of drug product to or from foreign countries for use in clinical trials.\nIn addition, the FDA may also put a clinical trial on clinical hold at any time during product candidate development.\nPatient enrollment, a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials, is affected by many factors including the size and nature of the patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the design of the clinical trial, competing clinical trials and clinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential benefits of the product candidate being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new therapies that may be approved for the indications we are investigating. Our ongoing AIM-TD clinical trial of SD-809 for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia will seek to enroll significantly more patients than we have enrolled in any single clinical trial of SD-809 to date and we may not be able to do so successfully. Furthermore, we rely on CROs and clinical trial sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials and, while we have agreements governing their committed activities, we have limited influence over their actual performance.\nWe could encounter delays if physicians encounter unresolved ethical issues associated with enrolling patients in clinical trials of our product candidates in lieu of prescribing existing treatments that have established safety and efficacy profiles. Principal investigators for our clinical trials may serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us from time to time and receive cash compensation in connection with such services. If these relationships exceed certain financial thresholds, they must be reported to the FDA at the time of NDA submission. Such payments made to any investigator or the investigator\u2019s institution that exceeds $25,000 during the time the clinical investigator is carrying out the study and for one year following completion of the study must be reported to the FDA at the time of NDA submission. In addition, disclosable financial interests include: (1) any compensation to the investigator by the sponsor in which the value could be affected by study outcome; (2) a proprietary interest in the tested product; and (3) any equity interest in the sponsor of the covered clinical study, including any ownership interest, stock options, or other financial interest whose value cannot be readily determined through reference to public prices. In addition to disclosing the financial interest of an investigator, the NDA applicant must describe any steps taken to minimize the risk of bias, which could include factors such as multiple study sites, the use of appropriate blinding and randomization procedures, and the assessment of objective study points. We expect to disclose a financial arrangement, including a grant to an investigator\u2019s institution, for at least one investigator and submit this information in our NDA. In addition, individuals associated with our CROs or any other entity that manages or is involved with our clinical trials, including principal investigators, may serve as consultants to us from time to time and receive cash compensation in connection with such services. If these relationships and any related compensation to the clinical investigator carrying out the study, or to any entity that manages or is involved with our clinical trials or to individuals associated with that entity, result in perceived or actual conflicts of interest, or the FDA concludes that the financial relationship may have affected interpretation of the study, the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site may be questioned and the utility of the clinical trial itself may be jeopardized, which could result in the delay or rejection of our NDA by the FDA. Any such delay or rejection could prevent us from commercializing SD-809.\nFurther, we could encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by us, the IRBs in the institutions in which such trials are being conducted, the Data Safety Monitoring Board for such trial, or by the FDA or other regulatory authorities due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using our product candidate, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial. If we experience termination of, or delays in the completion of, any clinical trial of our product candidate, the commercial prospects of our product candidate will be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenues will be delayed. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our product development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations significantly. Furthermore, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates.\nChanges in regulatory requirements and guidance also may occur and we may need to amend clinical trial protocols to reflect these changes. Amendments may require us to resubmit our clinical trial protocols to IRBs for re-examination, which may impact the costs, timing and successful completion of a clinical trial. If we experience delays in the completion of, or if we must terminate, any clinical trial of SD-809, our ability to obtain regulatory approval will be delayed and the commercial prospects, if any, for SD-809 may be harmed. If we ultimately commercialize SD-809 or any of our other product candidates, other therapies for the same indications may have been introduced to the market during the period we have been delayed and such therapies may have established a competitive advantage over our product candidates.\nWe may not obtain orphan drug exclusivity for any of our product candidates.\nOur business strategy focuses on the development and commercialization of novel medicines for the treatment of orphan diseases. In the United States, under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition. Such diseases and conditions are those that affect fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or, if they affect more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for these types of diseases or conditions will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. The applicant will not be required to pay the NDA fee if the orphan designation has been granted, but will be required to pay the NDA fee if the designation is still pending at the time the NDA is submitted, although the FDA could still grant a waiver of the application fee for the first drug application as a small business (section 736(d) of the FDCA) if the criteria for a small business are met. If the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by that agency. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process, but it can lead to financial incentives, such as opportunities for grant funding toward clinical trial costs, tax advantages in-lieu of R&D tax credits and user-fee waivers. If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug marketing exclusivity for a period of seven years. Orphan drug marketing exclusivity generally prevents the FDA from approving another application, including a full NDA, to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, including if the FDA concludes that the later drug is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. The FDA defines \u201csame drug\u201d as a drug that contains the same active chemical entity and is intended for the same use as the drug in question. A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug marketing exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation or if a third party first obtains approval of the same drug for the orphan designated indication (unless FDA concludes that the later drug is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care). Orphan drug marketing exclusivity rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.\nWe received an orphan drug designation of SD-809 for the treatment of Huntington\u2019s disease from the FDA in November 2014, and an orphan drug designation of SD-809 for the treatment of Tourette syndrome in the pediatric population (defined as zero through 16 years of age) from the FDA in January 2015. However, we may not obtain orphan drug designation for any of our other current, or future, product candidates and hence would not receive the market exclusivity or be afforded the financial incentives attained with orphan drug exclusivity.\nWe face significant competition from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. We have competitors both in the United States and international markets, including major multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and universities and other research institutions. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, such as larger research and development staff, experienced marketing and manufacturing organizations and well-established sales forces. Additional mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors. Competition may increase further as a result of advances in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these industries. Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing on an exclusive basis, products that are more effective, easier to administer or less costly than SD-809 or our other product candidates.\nWe anticipate that, if approved, SD-809 will compete primarily against Xenazine and, potentially in the future, generic tetrabenazine for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington\u2019s disease. In addition, there are several product candidates in clinical development for the treatment of Huntington\u2019s disease. These include Huntexil (prodipidine) and Nerventra (laquinimod), which are both being developed by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries; PBT2, which is being developed by Prana Biotechnology Ltd.; SEN0014196 (selisistat), which is being developed by Siena Biotech S.p.A.; PROCYSBI (cysteamine), which is approved for the treatment of nephropathic cystinosis and is being developed for Huntington\u2019s disease by Raptor Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; OMS824, which is being developed by Omeros Corporation; PF-2545920, which is being developed by Pfizer Inc. and BN82451 which is being developed by Ipsen.\nThere are currently no approved drugs for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia, but we believe that tetrabenazine is prescribed off-label for this indication. We are aware of several product candidates in clinical development for treatment of tardive dyskinesia including: NBI-98854 (valine ester substituted analog of a single stereoisomer of alpha), which is being developed by Neurocrine Biosciences Inc.; SNC-102 (acamprosate calcium), which is being developed by Synchroneuron Inc.; and Tardoxal (pyridoxine hydrochloride), which is being developed by Medicure Inc.\nThere are currently three FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of Tourette syndrome, aripiprazole (marketed as ABILIFY by Otsuka Pharmaceutical Group), haloperidol and pimozide, which are all neuroleptics. We believe that tetrabenazine and guanfacine are prescribed off-label for this indication as well. We are aware of several product candidates in clinical development for the treatment of Tourette syndrome including: NBI-98854 (a valine ester-substituted analog of alpha), which is being developed by Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc.; ecopipam (a synthetic benzazepine derivative), which is being developed by Psyadon Pharmaceuticals Inc.; AZD5213, which is being developed by AstraZeneca plc; CPP-109, which is being developed by Catalyst Pharmaceutical Partners; SNC-102 (acamprosate calcium), which is being developed by Synchroneuron, Inc.; and EPI-754, which is being developed by Edison Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nThe availability and price of our competitors\u2019 products could limit the demand, and the price we are able to charge, for SD-809 or our other product candidates. We may not be able to successfully execute on our business objectives if the market acceptance of SD-809 or our other product candidates is inhibited by significant price competition from Xenazine, or any generic tetrabenazine that may be available in the future, or if physicians are reluctant to switch from existing products to SD-809 or our other product candidates, or if physicians switch to other new products or choose to reserve SD-809 or our other product candidates for use in limited patient populations. Xenazine is expected to lose its market exclusivity related to its orphan drug status for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington\u2019s disease in August 2015 and generic versions of tetrabenazine may potentially be introduced into the market after such time. In addition, established pharmaceutical companies may invest heavily to accelerate discovery and development of novel compounds or to in-license and develop novel compounds that could make SD-809 or our other product candidates obsolete.\nWhile comparative safety or efficacy are not required for FDA approval, and we do not intend to test SD-809 against Xenazine in our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials, any new product that competes with an approved product must demonstrate compelling advantages in efficacy, convenience, tolerability and safety in order to overcome price competition and to be commercially successful. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection, obtaining FDA approval or discovering, developing and commercializing products before we do, which would have a material adverse impact on our business. The inability to compete with existing products or subsequently introduced products would have a material adverse impact on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval for SD-809 or any future product candidates, we will be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense, and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements.\nAny regulatory approvals that we receive for our product candidates will contain approved indicated uses, and we will be required to market any approved products in accordance with the indicated uses and our approved labeling. In addition, any regulatory approvals may contain conditions for approval or requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product candidate. In addition, if the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority approves any of our product candidates, the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, import, export and recordkeeping for the product will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration, as well as continued compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, and current good clinical practices, or cGCPs, for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with our third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, withdrawal of the product from the market, or voluntary or mandatory product recalls;\n\u00b7\nfines, warning or untitled letters or holds on clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nrefusal by the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;\n\u00b7\nproduct seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; and\n\u00b7\ninjunctions, the imposition of civil penalties or criminal prosecution.\nWe cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. Any government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate negative publicity. If we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance or if we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, regulatory sanctions may be applied or we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained, and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates and our business could be substantially harmed.\nWe have agreements with third-party CROs to conduct or monitor and manage data for our ongoing clinical programs, including SD-809. We rely heavily on these parties for execution of our clinical trials, and we control only certain aspects of their activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our trials is conducted in accordance with applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our reliance on our CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We and our CROs are required to comply with federal regulations and cGCPs, which are guidelines enforced by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for all of our product candidates in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce these cGCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we or any of these CROs fail to comply with applicable regulations and cGCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that, upon inspection, such regulatory authorities will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with the applicable regulations and cGCPs. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with drug product produced under applicable regulations and cGMP and will require a large number of trial subjects. Our or our respective CROs\u2019 failure to comply with these regulations or to recruit a sufficient number of patients may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. Moreover, our business may be implicated if any of our CROs violate federal or state fraud and abuse or false claims laws and regulations or healthcare privacy and security laws.\nOur CROs are not our employees and, except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such CROs, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our ongoing preclinical, clinical and nonclinical programs. These CROs may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical trials or other drug development activities, which could harm our competitive position. If our CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to complete development of, obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates. As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for SD-809 and other future product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed.\nSwitching or adding CROs involves substantial cost and requires extensive management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work. As a result, delays occur, which can materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines. Though we carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter similar challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on third parties to manufacture supplies of SD-809, and we intend to rely on third parties to manufacture commercial supplies of SD-809, if and when it is approved. The development and commercialization of SD-809 could be stopped or delayed if any such third party fails to provide us with sufficient quantities of product or fails to do so at acceptable quality levels or prices or fails to maintain or achieve satisfactory regulatory compliance.\nWe do not currently have nor do we plan to acquire the infrastructure or capability internally to manufacture our clinical drug supplies for use in the conduct of our clinical trials, and we lack the resources and the capability to manufacture SD-809 or our other product candidates on a clinical or commercial scale. Instead, we rely on our third-party manufacturing partners for the production of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and drug formulation of SD-809. The facilities used by our third-party manufacturers to manufacture SD-809 and any other potential product candidates that we may develop in the future must be successfully inspected by the applicable regulatory authorities, including the FDA, after we submit our NDA to the FDA. We are currently completely dependent on our third-party manufacturers for the production of SD-809 in accordance with cGMPs, which include, among other things, quality control, quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation.\nAlthough we have entered into an agreement for the manufacture of clinical supplies and initial commercial supplies of SD-809, our third-party manufacturers may not perform as agreed, may be unable to comply with these cGMP requirements and with FDA, state and foreign regulatory requirements or may terminate its agreement with us. If any of our third-party manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the applicable regulatory authorities\u2019 strict regulatory requirements, or pass regulatory inspection, our NDA will not be approved. In addition, although we are ultimately responsible for ensuring product quality, we have no direct day-to-day control over our third-party manufacturers\u2019 ability to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If our third-party manufacturers are unable to satisfy the regulatory requirements for the manufacture of our products, or if our suppliers or third-party manufacturers decide they no longer want to manufacture our products, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would be time-consuming and significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market our products. We might be unable to identify manufacturers for long-term commercial supply on acceptable terms or at all. Manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic announced and unannounced inspection by the FDA and other governmental authorities to ensure compliance with government regulations. Currently, our contract manufacturer for the API for SD-809 is located outside the United States and the FDA has recently increased the number of foreign drug manufacturers that it inspects as well as the frequency of such inspections. As a result, our third-party manufacturers may be subject to increased scrutiny.\nIf we were to experience an unexpected loss of SD-809 supply for clinical development or commercialization, we could experience delays in our ongoing or planned clinical trials as our third-party manufacturers would need to manufacture additional SD-809 and we may not be able to provide sufficient lead time to enable our third-party manufacturers to schedule a manufacturing slot, or to produce the necessary replacement quantities. This could result in delays in progressing our clinical development activities and achieving regulatory approval for our products, which could materially harm our business.\nThe manufacture of pharmaceutical products is complex and requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. We and our contract manufacturers must comply with cGMP regulations and guidelines. Manufacturers of pharmaceutical products often encounter difficulties in production, particularly in scaling up and validating initial production. These problems include difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control, including stability of the product, quality assurance testing, operator error, shortages of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with strictly enforced federal, state and foreign regulations. Furthermore, if microbial, viral or other contaminations are discovered in our products or in the manufacturing facilities in which our products are made, such manufacturing facilities may need to be closed for an extended period of time to investigate and remedy the contamination. We cannot assure you that any stability or other issues relating to the manufacture of any of our products will not occur in the future. Additionally, our manufacturers may experience manufacturing difficulties due to resource constraints or as a result of labor disputes or unstable political environments. If our manufacturers were to encounter any of these difficulties, or otherwise fail to comply with their contractual obligations, our ability to provide any product candidates to patients in clinical trials would be jeopardized. Any delay or interruption in the supply of clinical trial supplies could delay the completion of clinical trials, increase the costs associated with maintaining clinical trial programs and, depending upon the period of delay, require us to commence new clinical trials at additional expense or terminate clinical trials completely.\nAny adverse developments affecting clinical or commercial manufacturing of our products may result in shipment delays, inventory shortages, lot failures, product withdrawals or recalls, or other interruptions in the supply of our products or product candidates. We may also have to take inventory write-offs and incur other charges and expenses for products or product candidates that fail to meet specifications, undertake costly remediation efforts or seek more costly manufacturing alternatives. Accordingly, failures or difficulties faced at any level of our supply chain could materially adversely affect our business and delay or impede the development and commercialization of any of our products or product candidates and could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe plan to rely on third-party specialty channels to distribute SD-809 to patients, to successfully commercialize SD-809, if approved. If we are unable to effectively establish and manage this distribution process, the commercial launch and sales of SD-809 may be delayed or compromised.\nWe plan to contract with and rely on third-party specialty pharmacies to distribute SD-809 to patients. A specialty pharmacy is a pharmacy that specializes in the dispensing of medications for complex or chronic conditions, which require a high level of patient education and ongoing management. This distribution network will require significant attention from our management team. If we are unable to effectively establish and manage this distribution process, the commercial launch and sales of SD-809 will be delayed or compromised and our results of operations may be harmed.\nIn addition, the use of specialty pharmacies involves certain risks, including, but not limited to, risks that these organizations will:\n\u00b7\nnot provide us with accurate or timely information regarding their inventories, the number of patients who are using our SD-809, or complaints regarding SD-809;\n\u00b7\nnot effectively sell or support SD-809;\n\u00b7\nreduce or discontinue their efforts to sell or support SD-809;\n\u00b7\nnot devote the resources necessary to sell SD-809 in the volumes and within the time frames that we expect;\n\u00b7\nbe unable to satisfy financial obligations to us or others; or\n\u00b7\ncease operations.\nAny such events may result in decreased sales and lower revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to generate revenues from SD-809 or our other product candidates will be subject to attaining significant market acceptance among physicians, patients and healthcare payors.\nNeither SD-809 nor any of our other product candidates, if approved, may attain market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors or the medical community. We believe that the degree of market acceptance and our ability to generate revenues from SD-809 and our other product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\ntiming of market introduction of our products as well as competitive drugs;\n\u00b7\nefficacy and safety of our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nthe clinical indication(s), if any, for which SD-809 or our other product candidates are approved;\n\u00b7\nwith respect to SD-809, the size of the markets for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington\u2019s disease, tardive dyskinesia and Tourette syndrome;\n\u00b7\nacceptance by patients, primary care specialists and key specialists, including neurologists and psychiatrists;\n\u00b7\npotential or perceived advantages or disadvantages of SD-809 or our other product candidates over other alternative treatments, including cost of treatment and relative convenience and ease of administration and length of sustained benefits from treatment;\n\u00b7\nstrength of sales, marketing and distribution support;\n\u00b7\nthe price of our product candidates, both in absolute terms and relative to alternative treatments;\n\u00b7\nthe effect of current and future healthcare laws;\n\u00b7\navailability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from government and other third-party payors;\n\u00b7\nproduct labeling requirements of the FDA or other regulatory authorities; and\n\u00b7\nthe requirements of the REMS likely to be imposed by the FDA.\nWhile we believe that the reduced interpatient variability and lower dosing frequency of SD-809 relative to Xenazine will allow us to differentiate SD-809 from Xenazine in the market, if approved, because we do not intend to conduct a Phase 3 clinical trial comparing SD-809 to Xenazine, we will not be able to make direct comparative claims regarding the safety of SD-809 and Xenazine either in labeling or in our promotional materials for SD-809 from such trials. If SD-809 or any of our other product candidates is approved but fails to attain market acceptance by physicians, health care payors, or patients, we may not be able to generate significant revenue to achieve or sustain profitability, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nCoverage and reimbursement may not be available, or may be available at only limited levels, for SD-809 or our other product candidates, which could make it difficult for us to sell our product candidates profitably.\nMarket acceptance and sales of SD-809 or our other product candidates will depend in large part on global reimbursement policies and may be affected by future healthcare reform measures. Successful commercialization of SD-809 or our other product candidates will depend in part on the availability of governmental and third-party payor reimbursement for the cost of our product candidates. Government authorities, private health insurers and other organizations establish coverage and reimbursement policies for new products, including product candidates like SD-809. In particular, in the United States, the Medicare and Medicaid programs increasingly are used as models for how private payors and other governmental payors develop their coverage and reimbursement policies for drugs and other medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which has resulted in lower average selling prices. Further, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States will put additional pressure on product pricing, coverage, reimbursement and utilization, which may adversely affect our product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from policies and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, coverage and reimbursement policies and pricing in general.\nIn March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, PPACA, became law in the United States. PPACA substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly affects the pharmaceutical industry. Among the provisions of PPACA of greatest importance to the pharmaceutical industry are the following: (1) an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs; (2) an increase in the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13.0% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively; (3) extension of manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; (4) expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the Federal Poverty Level in 2014, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability; (5) expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program; (6) expansion of health care fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance; (7) a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts to negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer\u2019s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and (8) a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since PPACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation\u2019s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and will stay in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.\nWe expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of SD-809 and our other product candidates, if approved, and any other products that we may develop, due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative proposals. If we fail to successfully secure and maintain adequate coverage and reimbursement for our products or are significantly delayed in doing so, we will have difficulty achieving market acceptance of our products and expected revenue and profitability which would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may also be subject to healthcare laws, regulation and enforcement and our failure to comply with those laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial conditions.\nAlthough we currently do not have any products on the market, if SD-809 or any future product candidates are approved, once we begin commercializing our products, we may be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:\n\u00b7\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u00b7\nfederal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent;\n\u00b7\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u00b7\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u00b7\nthe federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers, and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members;\n\u00b7\nstate law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers;\n\u00b7\nstate laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources;\n\u00b7\nstate laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures;\n\u00b7\nstate laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts;\n\u00b7\nstate laws governing pharmaceutical distribution that require application and registration with state boards of pharmacy; and\n\u00b7\nstate requirements related to cGMP inspections of pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities operating within their state.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. In addition, recent health care reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, PPACA, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback and criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. Moreover, PPACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.\nIf we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities, we may not be able to effectively market and sell our products and generate product revenue.\nWe are developing SD-809 for specific patient populations served by neurologists as well as psychiatrists. We do not currently have an organization for the sale, marketing or distribution of SD-809 or any of our other product candidates and we must build this organization, or enter into a marketing collaboration with a third party, in order to commercialize SD-809 and any future product candidates. We intend to establish an initial internal specialty sales force to sell SD-809, if approved, for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington\u2019s disease. In addition, we intend to enter into contractual relationships with specialty pharmacies for the distribution of SD-809, if approved. We may partner with third parties to commercialize SD-809 if it is approved for other indications, including tardive dyskinesia and Tourette syndrome.\nThe establishment and development of our own sales force in the United States to market SD-809 will be expensive and time consuming and could delay any product launch, and we cannot be certain that we would be able to successfully develop this capacity. If we are unable to establish our sales and marketing capability or any other non-technical capabilities necessary to commercialize any products we may develop, we will need to contract with third parties to market and sell such products in the United States. We currently possess limited resources and may not be successful in establishing our own internal sales force or in establishing arrangements with third parties, including with specialty pharmacies, on acceptable terms, if at all.\nWe will need to increase the size of our organization and the scope of our outside vendor relationships, and we may experience difficulties in managing growth.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had 35 full-time employees. In addition, we have engaged part-time employees and individual consultants to assist us with a number of activities, including finance, clinical, regulatory and quality. We will need to expand our managerial, operational, financial and other resources in order to manage our operations and clinical trials, continue our research and development activities, commercialize SD-809, if approved, and transition to operating as a public company. Our management and scientific personnel, systems and facilities currently in place may not be adequate to support this expected growth. Our need to effectively manage our operations, growth and various projects requires that we:\n\u00b7\nmanage our clinical trials effectively, including our ongoing clinical trials of SD-809;\n\u00b7\nmanage our internal development efforts effectively while carrying out our contractual obligations to contractors and other third parties;\n\u00b7\nmanage our expanding manufacturing operations;\n\u00b7\ncontinue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and reporting systems and procedures; and\n\u00b7\nattract and retain sufficient numbers of talented employees.\nBecause we rely on numerous consultants, effectively outsourcing many key functions of our business, we will need to be able to effectively manage these consultants to ensure that they successfully carry out their contractual obligations and meet expected deadlines. However, if we are unable to effectively manage our outsourced activities or if the quality or accuracy of the services provided by consultants is compromised for any reason, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates or otherwise advance our business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our existing consultants or find other competent outside contractors and consultants on economically reasonable terms, or at all. If we are not able to effectively expand our organization by hiring new employees and expanding our groups of consultants and contractors, we may be unable to successfully implement the tasks necessary to further develop and commercialize our product candidates and, accordingly, may not achieve our research, development and commercialization goals.\nIf we are not successful in attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel, we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy.\nOur ability to compete in the highly competitive biotechnology and pharmaceuticals industries depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial, scientific and medical personnel. In order to retain valuable employees and consultants at our company, in addition to salary and other cash incentives, we provide incentive stock options and restricted stock grants that vest over time. The value to employees and consultants of stock options and restricted stock grants that vest over time will be significantly affected by movements in our stock price that are beyond our control, and may at any time be insufficient to counteract more lucrative offers from other companies.\nOur scientific team in particular has expertise in many different aspects of drug discovery and development and may be difficult to retain or replace. We conduct our operations at our facilities in San Diego, California and this region is headquarters to many other pharmaceutical companies and many academic and research institutions and therefore we face increased competition for personnel in this location. Competition for skilled personnel in our market is very intense and competition for experienced scientists may limit our ability to hire and retain highly qualified personnel on acceptable terms.\nDespite our efforts to retain valuable employees, members of our management and scientific and development teams may terminate their employment with us on short notice. Although we have written employment arrangements with our employees, these employment arrangements provide for at-will employment, which means that our employees can leave our employment at any time, with or without notice. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees and our inability to find suitable replacements could potentially harm our business, financial condition and prospects. We do not maintain \u201ckey man\u201d insurance policies on the lives of these individuals or the lives of any of our other employees.\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited financial and management resources, we focus on a limited number of research programs and product candidates and are currently focused principally on SD-809. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial drugs or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable drugs. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through future collaboration, licensing or other arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights.\nThe terms of our term loan require us to meet certain operating and financial covenants and place restrictions on our operating and financial flexibility. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, the terms of any new debt could further restrict our ability to operate our business.\nIn December 2013, we entered into a term loan facility with Oxford Finance LLC, or Oxford, and its assignees, collectively referred to as the lenders, for an aggregate amount of $15.0 million, which was funded at closing, and in December 2014, we amended the facility to extend the interest-only payment period. Our obligations under the term loan facility are secured, subject to customary permitted liens and other agreed upon exceptions, by perfected first priority interest in substantially all of our tangible personal property, excluding our intellectual property. Our intellectual property is subject to a negative pledge. $5.0 million of the proceeds from the term loan were used to repay our Square 1 credit facility. The term loan bears interest at a fixed rate equal to 8.99% per annum and matures on January 1, 2018. We have been making interest-only payments pursuant to the terms of the loan facility and, pursuant to the terms of the December 2014 amendment, we are required to make a total of 24 monthly interest-only payments through January 1, 2016 followed by 24 equal monthly payments against the outstanding principal and interest. However, if we complete an NDA submission of SD-809 for chorea associated with Huntington\u2019s disease, and we are otherwise in compliance with the loan facility, as of June 30, 2015, the interest-only period will extended to 30 months, followed by 18 equal monthly payments against the outstanding principal and interest. Upon repayment of the term loan, we are required to make a final payment to the lender equal to 3% of the original amount of the term loan.\nThe loan and security agreement governing the credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, indemnification provisions and events of default. The affirmative covenants include, among others, covenants requiring us to maintain our legal existence and governmental approvals, deliver certain financial reports and maintain insurance. The negative covenants include, among others, restrictions on dispositions, changes in business, management, ownership or business locations, mergers or acquisitions, indebtedness, encumbrances, distributions, investments, transactions with affiliates and subordinated debt. If we default under the credit facility, Oxford may accelerate all of our repayment obligations and take control of our pledged assets, potentially requiring us to renegotiate our agreement on terms less favorable to us or to immediately cease operations. Further, if we are liquidated, Oxford\u2019s right to repayment would be senior to the rights of the holders of our common stock to receive any proceeds from the liquidation. Oxford could declare a default under the credit facility upon the occurrence of an event of default, which includes any event that Oxford interprets as a material adverse change as defined under the loan and security agreement, thereby requiring us to repay the loan immediately or to attempt to reverse the declaration of default through negotiation or litigation. Any declaration by Oxford of an event of default could significantly harm our business and prospects and could cause the price of our common stock to decline. If we raise any additional debt financing, the terms of such additional debt could further restrict our operating and financial flexibility.\nOur limited operating history makes evaluating our business and future prospects difficult, and may increase the risk of any investment in our common stock.\nWe were formed as a California corporation in February 2001. In June 2007 we reincorporated in Delaware. Our operations to date have been limited to developing SD-809 and our other product candidates. In addition, we have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully overcome many of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving fields, particularly in the pharmaceutical area. Nor have we demonstrated an ability to obtain regulatory approval for or to commercialize a product candidate. Consequently, any predictions about our future performance may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a history of successfully developing and commercializing a significant number of pharmaceutical products.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our current and any future CROs and other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. While we have not experienced any such material system failure, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business operations. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Likewise, we rely on third parties to manufacture SD-809 and conduct clinical trials, and similar events relating to their computer systems could also have a material adverse effect on our business. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development and commercialization of our product candidate could be delayed.\nBusiness interruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nOur operations could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, systems failures, water shortages, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics and other natural or man-made disasters or business interruptions. The occurrence of any of these business interruptions could seriously harm our business and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. Our management operates in our principal executive offices located in San Diego, California. If our offices were affected by a natural or man-made disaster, particularly those that are characteristic of the region, such as wildfires and earthquakes, or other business interruption, our ability to manage our domestic and foreign operations could be impaired, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We currently rely, and intend to rely in the future, on our third-party manufacturers, to produce our supply of SD-809. Our ability to obtain supplies of SD-809 could be disrupted, and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected if the operations of our third-party manufacturers were affected by a man-made or natural disaster or other business interruption. The ultimate impact of such events on us, our significant suppliers and our general infrastructure is unknown.\nOur business involves the use of hazardous materials, and we and our third-party manufacturers must comply with environmental laws and regulations, which can be expensive and restrict how we do business.\nOur third-party manufacturers\u2019 activities involve the controlled storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials owned by us, including the components of SD-809 and other hazardous compounds. We and our manufacturers are subject to federal, state and local as well as foreign laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials. Although we believe that the safety procedures utilized by our third-party manufacturers for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of an accident, state, federal or foreign authorities may curtail the use of hazardous materials and interrupt our business operations. We do not currently maintain hazardous materials insurance coverage. If we are subject to any liability as a result of our third-party manufacturers\u2019 activities involving hazardous materials, our business and financial condition may be adversely affected. In the future we may seek to establish longer term third-party manufacturing arrangements, pursuant to which we would seek to obtain contractual indemnification protection from such third-party manufacturers potentially limiting this liability exposure.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our products.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability as a result of the clinical trials and, if approved, the commercialization of SD-809 or our other product candidates. For example, we may be sued if any product we develop allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during clinical trials, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability or a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state or foreign consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our product candidate. Even a successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u00b7\ndecreased demand for SD-809 or other product candidates that we may develop in the future;\n\u00b7\ninjury to our reputation;\n\u00b7\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u00b7\ninitiation of investigations by regulators;\n\u00b7\ncosts to defend the related litigation;\n\u00b7\na diversion of management\u2019s time and our resources;\n\u00b7\nsubstantial monetary awards to clinical trial participants or patients;\n\u00b7\nproduct recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u00b7\nloss of revenue;\n\u00b7\nexhaustion of any available insurance and our capital resources;\n\u00b7\nthe inability to commercialize our products or product candidates; and\n\u00b7\na decline in our stock price.\nOur inability to obtain and retain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of products we develop. We currently carry product liability insurance covering our clinical trials in the amount of $10.0 million in the aggregate. Although we maintain such insurance, any claim that may be brought against us could result in a court judgment or settlement in an amount that is not covered, in whole or in part, by our insurance or that is in excess of the limits of our insurance coverage. If we determine that it is prudent to increase our product liability coverage due to the commercial launch of SD-809 or any of our other product candidates, we may be unable to obtain such increased coverage on acceptable terms or at all. Our insurance policies also have various exclusions, and we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no coverage. We will have to pay any amounts awarded by a court or negotiated in a settlement that exceed our coverage limitations or that are not covered by our insurance, and we may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient capital to pay such amounts.\nOur employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, CROs, consultants and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading.\nWe are exposed to the risk of that our employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, CROs, consultants and vendors may engage in fraudulent conduct or other illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or disclosure of unauthorized activities to us that violates: (1) FDA regulations, including those laws requiring the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to the FDA, (2) manufacturing standards, (3) federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, or (4) laws that require the reporting of financial information or data accurately. Specifically, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. We have adopted a code of business conduct and ethics, but it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Capital Requirements\nWe have incurred significant operating losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future and may never be profitable.\nWe have a limited operating history and have focused our efforts primarily on developing SD-809 and our other product candidates. SD-809 will require substantial additional development time and resources before we will be able to receive regulatory approvals for all three planned indications, implement commercialization strategies and begin generating revenue from product sales, as will our other product candidates, and there can be no assurance that any of our product candidates will ever achieve regulatory approval or generate any revenue. We do not know when we will generate any revenue, if ever, from sales of SD-809 or any of our other product candidates. We have incurred losses each year since our inception, including net losses of $59.6, $15.6 million and $15.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Moreover, as of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $125.1 million.\nWe have devoted most of our financial resources to product development. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity and debt securities. The size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future expenditures and our ability to generate revenue. To date, we do not have any product candidates that have been commercialized, and if SD-809 is not successfully developed or commercialized in either Huntington\u2019s disease, tardive dyskinesia or Tourette syndrome, or if none of our other product candidates are successfully developed or commercialized, or if revenue is insufficient following marketing approval, we may not achieve profitability and our business may fail.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, we are unable to fully predict the timing or amount of our increased expenses, but we expect to continue to incur substantial expenses, which we expect to increase as we expand our development activities and build a specialty sales force and commercialization infrastructure. Our expenses could increase beyond expectations if we are required by the FDA to perform studies in addition to those that we currently anticipate. As a result of the foregoing, we expect to continue to incur significant and increasing losses and negative cash flows for the foreseeable future, which may increase compared to past periods. Even if we are able to generate revenue from the sale of any approved products, we may not become profitable and may need to obtain additional funding to continue operations.\nTo complete the development and commercialization of SD-809, if approved, for all three planned indications, we may require additional capital. Raising additional funds through debt or equity financing may be dilutive or restrict our operations and raising funds through collaborations or licenses may require us to relinquish rights to our product candidates.\nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception. From inception to January 31, 2015, we have raised net cash proceeds of approximately $424.7 million from the sale of common stock, convertible preferred stock, convertible notes and warrants, the exercise of stock options and warrants and ESPP purchases, most of which has been raised since our IPO in February 2014. For example, we raised total net proceeds of $151.6 million in 2014 connection with our initial public offering in February 2014 and our follow-on offering in July 2014. In January 2015, we completed a second follow-on offering in which we raised additional net proceeds of approximately $190.5 million.\nWe expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to continue clinical development of SD-809, including the conduct of our ongoing clinical trials, planned clinical trials and any future required clinical development, seek regulatory approval for SD-809, launch and commercialize SD-809, if approved, and repay our existing debt.\nWe expect that the net proceeds to us from our recent public offerings will be sufficient to fund our operations at least through 2017, including through the completion of our ongoing and planned clinical trials and the filing of an NDA and commercial launch of SD-809, if approved, for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington\u2019s disease. However, changing circumstances may cause us to consume capital significantly faster than we currently anticipate, and we may need to spend more money than currently expected because of circumstances beyond our control. For example, our ongoing clinical trials may encounter technical or other issues that could cause our development costs to increase more than we expected. In any event, we expect that we will require additional capital to complete the development of SD-809 for other indications.\nWe expect to finance future cash needs through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, as well as through interest income earned on cash balances. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. Debt financings may be coupled with an equity component, such as warrants to purchase shares, which could also result in dilution of our existing stockholders\u2019 ownership. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and could also result in certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. In addition, if we raise additional funds through collaboration or license arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish potentially valuable rights to our product candidates or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nWe cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Subject to limited exceptions, the credit facility also prohibits us from incurring indebtedness without the prior written consent of Oxford. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of SD-809. We also could be required to: (1) significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of our other product candidates; (2) relinquish or license on unfavorable terms our rights to our product candidates that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves; or (3) significantly curtail or cease operations altogether.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain or protect intellectual property rights related to our product candidates, we may not be able to compete effectively in our market.\nWe rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property related to SD-809 and our other product candidates. The strength of patents in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical field involves complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. The patent applications that we own may fail to result in issued patents with claims that cover the products in the United States or in other countries. If this were to occur, early generic competition could be expected against product candidates in development. There is no assurance that all of the potentially relevant prior art relating to our patents and patent applications, which can invalidate a patent or prevent a patent from issuing based on a pending patent application, has been found.\nEven if patents do successfully issue, third parties may challenge their validity, enforceability or scope, which may result in such patents being narrowed or invalidated. Any adverse outcome in these types of matters could result in one or more generic versions of our products being launched before the expiration of our Orange Book listed patents, which could adversely affect our ability to establish market share or successfully execute our business strategy to increase sales of our products and would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations, including causing a significant decrease in our revenues and cash flows.\nComposition of matter patents on the chemical API are generally considered to be the strongest form of intellectual property protection for pharmaceutical products, as such patents provide protection without regard to any method of use. Our SD-809 patent portfolio currently includes one issued composition of matter patent in the United States (US 8,524,733), one in Europe (EP 2326643B), one in Japan (JP 5616345) and one in China (CN 102186848), one in New Zealand (591615), and one patent application for which we have received a notice of allowance in the United States, and several pending patent applications in the United States and other countries that, if issued, will cover compositions of matter, methods of treatment, and formulations. The issued U.S. patent is expected to expire in March 2031, and the European patents, Japanese patents and patents in the other countries are expected to expire in September 2029. We cannot be certain that the claims in our patent applications covering composition of matter will be considered patentable by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or U.S. PTO, and courts in the United States or by the patent offices and courts in foreign countries. Method-of-use patents protect the use of a product for the specified method. This type of patent does not prevent a competitor from making and marketing a product that is identical to our product for an indication that is outside the scope of the patented method. Moreover, even if competitors do not actively promote their product for our targeted indications, physicians may prescribe these products off-label. Although off-label prescriptions may infringe or contribute to the infringement of method-of-use patents, the practice is common and such infringement is difficult to prevent or prosecute.\nFurthermore, even if they are unchallenged, our patents and patent applications may not adequately protect our intellectual property, provide exclusivity for our product candidates or prevent others from designing around our claims. If the patent applications we hold with respect to SD-809 or our other product candidates fail to issue or if the breadth or strength of protection of our patents or patent applications is threatened, it could threaten our ability to commercialize our products. We cannot offer any assurances about which, if any, patents will issue or whether any issued patents will be found not invalid and not unenforceable or will go unthreatened by third parties. Further, if we encounter delays in regulatory approvals, the period of time during which we could market SD-809 or our other product candidates under patent protection could be reduced. Since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing, and some remain so until issued, we cannot be certain that we were the first to file any patent application related to SD-809 or any of our other product candidates. Furthermore, if third parties have filed such patent applications, an interference proceeding in the United States can be provoked by a third party or instituted by us to determine who was the first to invent any of the subject matter covered by the patent claims of our applications. For patent applications filed on or after March 16, 2013, under the \u201cfirst inventor-to-file\u201d system for patent applications of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, priority of patent applications in the United States is determined based on filing date. In the United States, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years after it is filed, or 20 years after the filing date of any non-provisional application to which it claims priority. Various extensions may be available; however the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Once the patent life has expired for SD-809 or any of our other product candidates, we may be open to competition from generic medications.\nIn addition to the protection afforded by patents, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary know-how that is not patentable or which we elect not to patent, processes for which patents are difficult to enforce and any other elements of our drug discovery and development processes that involve proprietary know-how, information or technology that is not covered by patents. Although we expect all of our employees to assign their inventions to us, and all of our employees, consultants, advisors and any third parties who have access to our proprietary know-how, information or technology to enter into confidentiality agreements, we cannot provide any assurances that all such agreements have been duly executed or that our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. If the steps taken to maintain our trade secrets are deemed inadequate, we may have insufficient recourse against third parties for misappropriating the trade secret. In addition, our competitors may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information. For example, the FDA, as part of its Transparency Initiative, is currently considering whether to make additional information publicly available on a routine basis, including information that we may consider to be trade secrets or other proprietary information, and it is not clear at the present time how the FDA\u2019s disclosure policies may change in the future, if at all.\nOur ability to obtain patents is highly uncertain because, to date, some legal principles remain unresolved, there has not been a consistent policy regarding the breadth or interpretation of claims allowed in patents in the United States and the specific content of patents and patent applications that are necessary to support and interpret patent claims is highly uncertain due to the complex nature of the relevant legal, scientific and factual issues. Changes in either patent laws or interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection. For example, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, which was signed into law in September 2011, includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include changes in the way patent applications will be prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. The U.S. PTO has developed new and untested regulations and procedures to govern the full implementation of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, and in particular, the first to file provisions, only became effective in March 2013. The Leahy-Smith Act has also introduced procedures making it easier for third parties to challenge issued patents, as well as to intervene in the prosecution of patent applications. Finally, the Leahy-Smith Act contains new statutory provisions that require the U.S. PTO to issue new regulations for their implementation and it may take the courts years to interpret the provisions of the new statute. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the cost of prosecuting our patent applications, our ability to obtain patents based on our patent applications and our ability to enforce or defend our issued patents. An inability to obtain, enforce and defend patents covering our proprietary technologies would materially and adversely affect our business prospects and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. Further, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same manner as the laws of the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing. As a result, we may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property both in the United States and abroad. For example, if the issuance to us, in a given country, of a patent covering an invention is not followed by the issuance, in other countries, of patents covering the same invention, or if any judicial interpretation of the validity, enforceability, or scope of the claims in, or the written description or enablement in, a patent issued in one country is not similar to the interpretation given to the corresponding patent issued in another country, our ability to protect our intellectual property in those countries may be limited. Changes in either patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may materially diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection. If we are unable to prevent material disclosure of the non-patented intellectual property related to our technologies to third parties, and there is no guarantee that we will have any such enforceable trade secret protection, we may not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFurther, many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing.\nInterference proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by us may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. Our defense of litigation or interference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees. We may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nProceedings to enforce our patent rights in the United States could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights in the United States may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the U.S. PTO and foreign patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patent. The U.S. PTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. While an inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include, but are not limited to, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. If we fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering SD-809 or other future product candidates, our competitors might be able to enter the market, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur reliance on third parties requires us to share our trade secrets, which increases the possibility that a competitor will discover them or that our trade secrets will be misappropriated or disclosed.\nBecause we rely on third parties to manufacture SD-809 and intend to rely on third parties for the manufacture of our other product candidates, we must, at times, share trade secrets with them. We seek to protect our proprietary technology in part by entering into confidentiality agreements and, if applicable, material transfer agreements, consulting agreements or other similar agreements with our advisors, employees, third-party contractors and consultants prior to beginning research or disclosing proprietary information. These agreements typically limit the rights of the third parties to use or disclose our confidential information, including our trade secrets. Despite the contractual provisions employed when working with third parties, the need to share trade secrets and other confidential information increases the risk that such trade secrets become known by our competitors, are inadvertently incorporated into the technology of others, or are disclosed or used in violation of these agreements. Given that our proprietary position is based, in part, on our know-how and trade secrets, a competitor\u2019s discovery of our trade secrets or other unauthorized use or disclosure would impair our competitive position and may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties.\nWe employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. We may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed confidential information of our employees\u2019 former employers or other third parties. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. There is no guarantee of success in defending these claims, and if we are successful, litigation could result in substantial cost and be a distraction to our management and other employees.\nWe may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our patents and other intellectual property.\nWe may also be subject to claims that former employees or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patents or other intellectual property. We may be subject to ownership disputes in the future arising, for example, from conflicting obligations of consultants or others who are involved in developing SD-809 or our other product candidates. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship or ownership. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, valuable intellectual property. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business, or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative:\n\u00b7\nOthers may be able to make compounds that are similar to our product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or have exclusively licensed.\n\u00b7\nWe might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patent or pending patent application that we own or have exclusively licensed.\n\u00b7\nWe might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions.\n\u00b7\nOthers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights.\n\u00b7\nIt is possible that our pending patent applications will not lead to issued patents.\n\u00b7\nIssued patents that we own may be held invalid or unenforceable, as a result of legal challenges by our competitors.\n\u00b7\nOur competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets.\n\u00b7\nWe may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable.\n\u00b7\nThe patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nShould any of these events occur, they could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe price of our stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nPrior to our recently completed initial public offering, there was no public market for our common stock. The trading price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including limited trading volume. In addition to the factors discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this Annual Report, these factors include:\n\u00b7\nthe commencement, enrollment or results of our ongoing and planned clinical trials of SD-809 or any other future clinical trials we may conduct, or changes in the development status of SD-809 or any future product candidate;\n\u00b7\nany delay in filing our NDA for SD-809 and any adverse development or perceived adverse development with respect to the FDA\u2019s review of the NDA, including without limitation the FDA\u2019s issuance of a \u201crefusal to file\u201d letter or a request for additional information;\n\u00b7\nadverse results or delays in our clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nour decision to initiate a clinical trial, not to initiate a clinical trial or to terminate an existing clinical trial;\n\u00b7\nadverse regulatory decisions, including failure to receive regulatory approval for SD-809 or any of our other product candidates;\n\u00b7\nchanges in laws or regulations applicable to our product candidates, including but not limited to clinical trial requirements for approvals;\n\u00b7\nadverse developments concerning our manufacturers;\n\u00b7\nour inability to obtain adequate product supply for any approved drug product or inability to do so at acceptable prices;\n\u00b7\nour ability to build a commercial organization or enter into a marketing collaboration with a third party;\n\u00b7\nour failure to commercialize SD-809, develop additional product candidates and commercialize additional drugs;\n\u00b7\nadditions or departures of our key scientific or management personnel;\n\u00b7\nunanticipated serious safety concerns related to the use of SD-809 or any future product candidates;\n\u00b7\nintroduction of new products or services offered by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\nannouncements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\nour ability to effectively manage our growth;\n\u00b7\nthe size and growth, if any, of the hyperkinetic movement disorder market;\n\u00b7\nour ability to successfully enter new markets or develop additional product candidates;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results;\n\u00b7\nour cash position;\n\u00b7\nour failure to meet the estimates and projections of the investment community or that we may otherwise provide to the public;\n\u00b7\npublication of research reports about us or our industry or positive or negative recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the market valuations of similar companies;\n\u00b7\noverall performance of the equity markets;\n\u00b7\nissuances of our debt or equity securities;\n\u00b7\nsales of our common stock by us or our stockholders in the future;\n\u00b7\ntrading volume of our common stock;\n\u00b7\nchanges in accounting practices;\n\u00b7\nineffectiveness of our internal controls;\n\u00b7\ndisputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u00b7\nsignificant lawsuits, including patent or stockholder litigation;\n\u00b7\ngeneral political and economic conditions; and\n\u00b7\nother events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the NASDAQ Global Market and biotechnology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities. This type of litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which would harm our business, operating results or financial condition.\nOur principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our shares and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nAs of February 15, 2015, our executive officers, directors and 5% stockholders and their affiliates beneficially owned an aggregate of approximately 64% of our outstanding voting shares. Therefore, these stockholders may have the ability to influence us through this ownership position. These stockholders may be able to determine all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, they may be able to control elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nA substantial number of the shares sold through our public offerings are held by our directors, executive management team and the entities affiliated with our directors. At the time of the offerings, these parties have agreed to lock-up periods in which they would not offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, their shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2014, these lock-up periods have expired; however, as part of our January 2015 follow-on offering, these parties agreed that for a period of 60 days after the date of the respective prospectus filing on January 23, 2015, they will not offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any of our common stock. As such, subject to certain limitations, approximately 9,414,021 shares of our common stock will become eligible for sale upon expiration of such lock-up period. Furthermore, persons who were stockholders prior to the sale of shares in our initial public offering are entitled to rights with respect to the registration of their shares under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, subject to the 60-day lock-up arrangement described above. Registration of these shares under the Securities Act would result in the shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act, except for shares held by our affiliates as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act.\nAny sales of securities by these stockholders, or other large shareholders, could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock by us, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans which provide for an automatic increase in the number of shares of common stock issuable thereunder each calendar year through 2024, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe expect that significant capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations, including conducting clinical trials, commercialization efforts, expanded research and development activities and costs associated with operating as a public company. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity or convertible securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction, investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. Such sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights superior to the rights of our existing stockholders, including stockholders who purchase shares in this offering.\nPursuant to the 2014 Plan, our management is authorized to grant stock options to our employees, directors and consultants. The number of shares available for future grant under our 2014 Plan will automatically increase on January 1st each year through January 1, 2024, by an amount equal to four percent of all shares of our capital stock outstanding as of December 31st of the preceding calendar year, subject to the ability of our board of directors to take action to reduce the size of such increase in any given year. On January 1, 2015, the initial automatic increase pursuant to the 2014 Plan occurred, resulting in 1,109,847 additional shares available for future grant under the 2014 Plan. In addition, our board of directors may grant or provide for the grant of rights to purchase shares of our common stock pursuant to the terms of the ESPP. The number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under our ESPP will automatically increase on January 1st each year through January 1, 2024, by an amount equal to the lesser of 530,000 shares or one percent of all shares of our capital stock outstanding as of December 31st of the preceding calendar year, subject to the ability of our board of directors to take action to reduce the size of such increase in any given year. On January 1, 2015, the initial automatic increase pursuant to the ESPP occurred, resulting in 277,461 additional shares available for future grant under the ESPP. Unless our board of directors elects not to increase the number of shares underlying our 2014 Plan and ESPP each year, our stockholders may experience additional dilution, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe have broad discretion in the use of the net proceeds from our recently completed public offerings and may not use them effectively.\nOur management has broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds to us from our recently completed public offerings. Because of the number and variability of factors that will determine our use of the net proceeds to us from this offering, their ultimate use may vary substantially from their currently intended use. Our management may not apply the net proceeds to us from this offering in ways that ultimately increase the value of your investment. The failure by our management to apply these funds effectively could harm our business. Pending their use, we may invest the net proceeds to us from this offering in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing securities. These investments may not yield a favorable return to our stockholders. If we do not invest or apply the net proceeds to us from this offering in ways that enhance stockholder value, we may fail to achieve expected financial results, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur ability to use our net operating tax loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nOur net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credits may expire and not be used. As of December 31, 2014, we had generated federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $91.2 million and $94.0 million, respectively. We also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately $5.2 million and $1.8 million, respectively.\nOur federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin expiring in 2021 if we have not used them prior to that time and our state net operating loss carryforwards will continue to expire in 2015. Our federal research and development tax credits will begin expiring in 2021 unless previously used. Our state research and development tax credits do not expire. Additionally, under Internal Revenue Code Sections 382 and 383, the annual use of our net operating loss carryforwards and research tax credits will be limited in the event a cumulative change in our ownership occurs within a three-year period, which is generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in equity ownership. Any such annual limitation may significantly reduce the utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards and research tax credits before they expire. In addition, certain states have suspended the use of net operating loss carryforwards for certain taxable years, and other states are considering similar measures. Currently, California allows companies to utilize their net operating losses, however, new legislation could suspend the use of those losses in the future. As a result, we may incur higher state income tax expense in the future. Depending on our future tax position, continued suspension of our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards in states in which we are subject to income tax could have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to the value of our shares.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common stock. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Our credit facility also contains a negative covenant that prohibits us from paying dividends without the prior written consent of Oxford. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to appreciation, if any, of their stock.\nWe are an emerging growth company, and we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in this Annual Report and our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years following the year in which we completed our initial public offering, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30 before that time or if we have total annual gross revenue of $1.0 billion or more during any fiscal year before that time, in which cases we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31, or if we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during any three year period before that time, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company immediately. Even after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we may still qualify as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d which would allow us to take advantage of many of the same exemptions from disclosure requirements including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our share price may be more volatile.\nUnder the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. As a result, changes in rules of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or their interpretation, the adoption of new guidance or the application of existing guidance to changes in our business could significantly affect our financial position and results of operations.\nWe incur significant increased costs as a result of operating as a new public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives.\nWe completed an initial public offering on February 10, 2014. As a new public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. We are now subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, which require, among other things, that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules subsequently adopted by the SEC and the NASDAQ Global Market to implement provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, imposes significant requirements on public companies, including requiring establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. Further, in July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, was enacted. There are significant corporate governance and executive compensation-related provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act that require the SEC to adopt additional rules and regulations in these areas such as \u201csay on pay\u201d and proxy access. Recent legislation permits emerging growth companies to implement many of these requirements over a longer period and up to five years from the pricing of an initial public offering. We intend to take advantage of this new legislation but cannot guarantee that we will not be required to implement these requirements sooner than budgeted or planned and thereby incur unexpected expenses. Stockholder activism, the current political environment and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate.\nWe expect the rules and regulations applicable to public companies to substantially increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly. If these requirements divert the attention of our management and personnel from other business concerns, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The increased costs will decrease our net income or increase our net loss, and may require us to reduce costs in other areas of our business or increase the prices of our products or services. For example, we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. We cannot predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs we may incur to respond to these requirements. The impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers.\nIf our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective, our public reporting may be unreliable, which may lead to misinformation being disseminated to the public.\nOur management evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2014, and concluded that as of that date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. However, in May 2014, we failed to timely furnish a Form 8-K to the SEC with respect to our results of operations and financial condition for the quarter ended March 31, 2014. While we believe that we have remediated the cause of the failure to timely furnish this Form 8-K, if we have failed to correct this issue or if our disclosure controls and procedures otherwise prove to be ineffective, our ability to report information required to be disclosed on a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected. Any such failure in our disclosure controls and procedures could result in misinformation being disseminated to the public. Investors relying upon any such misinformation may make an uninformed investment decision.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not continue to publish research or reports, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research or reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. As a newly public company, we have only limited research coverage by research analysts. We do not have any control over these analysts. Research analysts may elect not to initiate or continue to provide research coverage of our common stock, and such lack of research coverage may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The price of our stock could decline if one or more research analysts downgrade our stock or issue other unfavorable commentary or research. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease and we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price and trading volume to decline.\nAnti-takeover provisions under our charter documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change of control which could limit the market price of our common stock and may prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our board of directors that our stockholders might consider favorable. Some of these provisions include:\n\u00b7\na prohibition on stockholder action through written consent, which requires that all stockholder actions be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u00b7\na requirement that special meetings of stockholders be called only by the chairman of the board of directors, the chief executive officer, the president or by a majority of the total number of authorized directors;\n\u00b7\nadvance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations for election to our board of directors;\n\u00b7\na requirement that no member of our board of directors may be removed from office by our stockholders except for cause and, in addition to any other vote required by law, upon the approval of at least 662/3% of all outstanding shares of our voting stock then entitled to vote in the election of directors;\n\u00b7\na requirement of approval of at least 662/3% of all outstanding shares of our voting stock to amend any bylaws by stockholder action or to amend specific provisions of our certificate of incorporation; and\n\u00b7\nthe authority of the board of directors to issue preferred stock on terms determined by the board of directors without stockholder approval and which preferred stock may include rights superior to the rights of the holders of common stock.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These anti-takeover provisions and other provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by the then-current board of directors and could also delay or impede a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing or cause us to take other corporate actions you desire. Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our board of directors could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.", "PERMNO": 14448, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "ASPX"}
