RISK FACTORS\nIf any of the following risks actually occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition and the market price of our common stock could be negatively impacted. Although we believe that we have identified and discussed below the most significant risk factors affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our performance or financial condition. Any forecast regarding our future performance, including, but not limited to, forecasts regarding future revenue, product mix, cash flow and cash balances, are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements reflect various assumptions and are subject to significant uncertainties and risks that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statement, including the risks reflected in the risk factors set forth below. Consequently, the future results expressed or implied by any forward-looking statement are not guaranteed and the variation of actual results or events from such statements may be material and adverse.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\nWe may not be successful at implementing our long-term strategic plan.\nIn July 2020, we began the process of developing our long-term strategic plan and late in the third quarter of 2020, we began the initial implementation phase of our long-term strategic plan. This strategy is aimed at transforming Qumu as a more focused, cloud-first organization driving improved, high-margin recurring SaaS revenues.\nWe cannot ensure that our continued execution of our long-term strategic plan will be successful either in the short-term or in the long-term, or that this strategy will generate the intended operational or financial results within the timeframes expected or at all. Further, if customer preferences and the use of video in the enterprise do not evolve as we believe they will, many of our strategic initiatives and investments may be of limited value.\nMoreover, we may not execute our long-term strategic plan successfully because of errors in planning or timing, technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion, or lack of appropriate resources. Our failure to successfully execute on the initiatives within our long-term strategic plan, even if the strategy is sound, could result in loss of market share and sales. Additionally, if we do not effectively communicate our long-term strategic plan to our investors and stakeholders, we may not realize the full benefits that we would otherwise gain through successful execution of that strategy.\nWe have and intend to continue to execute our long-term strategic plan by investing in our cloud platform, in our go-to-market initiatives, targeted channel strategies, the development of new applications, products and features, and other initiatives that we have identified or that have yet to be developed. The process of identifying the specific initiatives to align with our long-term strategic plan and the process of implementing these initiatives is complex and uncertain. Additionally, we must commit\nsignificant resources to these initiatives before knowing whether our investments will result in the operational or financial results we expect or intend. The return on our investments in initiatives may be lower, or may develop more slowly, than we expect. For example, as Qumu expanded its SaaS salesforce in the first half of 2021, we expected our revenue growth rate to accelerate in the second half of 2021 as compared to the first half of 2021, which did not occur. While we have pivoted from primarily a direct sales strategy to a targeted channel-led strategy, our revenue growth may not accelerate as we expect. If we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed, our operating results may be adversely affected. There can be no assurance that we will develop and implement initiatives that will advance the goals of our long-term strategic plan in a cost-effective or timely manner or at all.\nOur history of losses and our cash resources available to execute our business plan over the next twelve months raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe experienced consolidated net losses of $16.4 million, $9.2 million and $6.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. While we generated positive cash flows from operations during part of 2020, we have historically not generated sufficient operating cash flow to fund our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our principal source of liquidity consisted of $20.6 million of cash and cash equivalents. In February 2022, our board of directors adopted an operating plan designed to accelerate cash flow break even operations and continue to support the pivot from primarily a direct sales strategy to a targeted channel-led strategy. As part of the board approved operating plan, we implemented a cost optimization program that is in addition to the cash management actions we took in 2021.\nAlso as part of this operating plan, on April 15, 2022, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the \u201cSVB Agreement\u201d) with Silicon Valley Bank providing for a revolving line of credit having a maturity of April 2024. The maximum availability for borrowing under the SVB Agreement is the lesser of $7.5 million or the sum of a defined borrowing base of 85% of eligible accounts receivable plus a non-formula amount of $2.5 million. The non-formula amount will be eliminated from availability under the line of credit at the earlier of April 30, 2023 or the date on which our net cash, as defined, is less than $5.0 million. No amounts are outstanding under the SVB Agreement as of April 15, 2022. The SVB Agreement requires us to maintain an adjusted quick ratio greater than or equal to 1.25 to 1.00. The adjusted quick ratio is the ratio of (a) unrestricted cash and cash equivalents in SVB deposit accounts or securities accounts plus net billed accounts receivable and (b) the sum of current liabilities less the current portion of deferred revenue. Our monthly operations and resulting adjusted quick ratio are subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, and negative operating results may cause non-compliance with the adjusted quick ratio.\nOur capital needs are based upon management estimates as to future revenue and expense. Currently, management is anticipating revenue growth through Qumu\u2019s channel sales partners in the second half of 2022 and is anticipating that expense will decreases over 2022 as a result of our prior cash management actions. However, if Qumu\u2019s revenue growth is significantly lower than anticipated and Qumu does not actively manage expenses and cash consumption in advance of these significant revenue shortfalls, Qumu will need additional capital to fund its business plan and under those circumstances, borrowing under our line of credit with SVB may be limited due to borrowing base availability or covenant non-compliance. Our current cash resources and the limitations under the SVB Agreement on our available borrowing present the risk that we will not have sufficient cash available in the amount or at the time we need it to fund our ongoing operations and execute our business plan over the next twelve months.\nAccordingly, our history of losses and our cash resources available to execute our business plan over the next twelve months raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nManagement\u2019s plans to address the doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern are discussed in Note 1-\"Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Liquidity and Going Concern Considerations.\" Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our success in achieving and maintaining an expense structure that is aligned with our revenue and cash flows, the availability of borrowing under the SVB Agreement, obtaining additional equity or debt financing, attaining further operating efficiencies, reducing expenditures and ultimately, generating significant revenue growth.\nOur plans address the doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern may not be successful. There can be no assurance that the Company would be able to obtain additional liquidity when needed or under acceptable terms, if at all. Additionally, some of our plans, such as further reducing expenditures, could yield unintended consequences, such as distraction of management and employees, business disruption, reduced employee morale and productivity, unexpected additional employee attrition, and the inability to attract or retain key personnel. These consequences could further negatively affect our ability to grow revenue and generate cash flow.\nThe perception of our ability to continue as a going concern may make it more difficult for us to obtain equity financing or alternative debt financing for the continuation of our operations and could result in the loss of confidence by investors, customers, and employees, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business and the trading price of our common stock.\nCompetition for highly skilled personnel is intense, and if we fail to attract and retain talented employees, we may fail to compete effectively.\nOur future success depends, in significant part, on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Competition in our industry for qualified employees, particularly in senior management, engineering, product development and sales, is intense and continues to become more competitive. In addition, our compensation arrangements may not be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees given the very high demand for these employees from other employers. Our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to compensate, retain and motivate our existing employees.\nIf we are unable to attract new customers, retain existing customers and sell additional products and services to our existing and new customers, our revenue growth and profitability will be adversely affected.\nTo increase our revenues and achieve profitability, we must regularly add new customers, retain our existing customers, ensure high rates of renewals among our existing customers, sell additional products and services to new and existing customers, or convert existing customers to our latest SaaS solution. Because we have pivoted from primarily a direct sales strategy to a targeted channel-led strategy, our success in adding new customers will be in part dependent upon our relationships with our channel partners and the success of the sales and marketing efforts of our channel partners.\nWe intend to grow our business by developing and improving our product offerings, ensuring high levels of customer satisfaction, competing effectively with products and services offered by others, retaining and attracting talent, developing relationships with channel partners and increasing our marketing activities.\nIf we fail to add new customers or lose existing customers, or if our existing customers do not renew their subscriptions at the same levels or do not increase their purchases of products and services, we will not grow our revenue as expected and our operating results will suffer.\nWe may need additional capital to support the execution of our strategic plan or to fund operations and any additional capital we seek may not be available in the amount or at the time we need it.\nWe experienced consolidated net losses of $16.4 million, $9.2 million and $6.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. While we generated positive cash flows from operations during part of 2020, we have historically not generated sufficient operating cash flow to fund our operations. In executing our long-term strategic plan, our strategy of driving improved, high-margin recurring revenues required us to invest in sales, marketing, research, and development initiatives, and implement new software programs and systems. Accordingly, we expect our operating expenses will continue to reflect the cost of those initiatives throughout 2022, and we expect our revenue growth rate to accelerate in the second half of 2022 as compared to the first half of 2022. However, even if SaaS revenues grow as expected in 2022, we may not achieve cash flow positivity until 2023.\nOur capital needs are based upon management estimates as to future revenue and expense. If we are not able to significantly increase revenue and revenue growth in 2022 or if our expenses are higher than anticipated or do not correspond to our rate of revenue growth, we will need to raise funds in the future to execute our strategic plan, fund operations and pursue our growth objectives. As of December 31, 2021, Qumu maintained an outstanding balance of $5.0 million on the line of credit with Wells Fargo Bank and was in compliance with all covenants of the loan and security agreement. On April 15, 2022, we closed on a new Loan and Security Agreement (the \u201cSVB Agreement\u201d) with Silicon Valley Bank providing for new line of credit to replace the Wells Fargo facility. The maximum availability for borrowing under the SVB Agreement is the lesser of $7.5 million or the sum of a defined borrowing base of 85% of eligible accounts receivable plus a non-formula amount of $2.5 million. The non-formula amount will be eliminated from availability under the line of credit at the earlier of April 30, 2023 or the date on which our net cash, as defined, is less than $5.0 million.\nWe cannot assure you that additional financing will be available in the amount or at the time we need it, or that it will be available on acceptable terms or at all. We may obtain future additional financing by drawing on our line of credit, incurring indebtedness or from an offering of our equity securities or any of these.\nIf we raise additional equity financing, our shareholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the value of shares of our common stock could decline. Our efforts to raise additional funds from the sale of equity may be\nhampered by the currently depressed trading price of our common stock. If we raise additional equity financing, new investors may demand rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of common stock. Our efforts to raise funds by incurring additional indebtedness may be hampered by the borrowing base limits of the SVB Agreement, by the covenants and restrictions of our existing outstanding indebtedness and the fact that our assets are pledged to our lender to secure existing debt. The covenants of our loan and security agreement restrict our ability to make dividends, create liens, incur indebtedness, and sell our assets and properties, subject to certain exceptions. Likewise, any additional debt we incur would likely have covenants that would affect the manner in which we conduct our business, including by restricting our ability to incur additional indebtedness, preventing us from creating liens or requiring specified financial covenants. In addition, we may face challenges in securing additional debt financing if our future cash flow from operations is not sufficient to support debt service payments. If we cannot timely raise any needed funds, we may be forced to make further substantial reductions in our operating expenses, which could limit our sales and marketing efforts, adversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, limit our ability to develop and enhance our solutions, make it more difficult for us to respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated working capital requirements, and otherwise adversely affect our ability to pursue our strategic plan or growth objectives.\nWhile we are investing heavily in sales, marketing and research and development to enhance revenue growth and become cash flow positive, we may not achieve those goals or achieve or sustain cash flows or profitability in the future.\nIn order to achieve our strategic plan, we must grow our cloud business, scale our SaaS recurring revenue base, and increase the SaaS recurring revenue as a proportion of our recurring revenue mix. In order to achieve cash flow positivity and profitability in the future, we must increase the revenues received from the sale of our enterprise video content management software solutions, hardware, maintenance and support, and professional and other services, as well as achieve and maintain an expense structure that is aligned with our forecasted revenue and cash flows. Our focus is on growing our SaaS business as we expect our on-premise hardware, license and maintenance business to continue to decline. Our ability to increase revenues depends upon increasing the number of new SaaS customers and expanding our sales to existing customers, maintaining high renewal rates among our existing customers, and maintaining our prices (despite pricing pressure due to competition). While Qumu expects operating expense in 2022 to decrease compared to 2021, Qumu expects cash flows from operating activities in 2022 to be significantly affected by expenditures associated with the continued execution of our strategic plan, as well as those factors that have historically impacted operating cash flows - fluctuations in revenues, timing of customer payments, personnel costs, outside service providers, and the amount and timing of royalty payments and equipment purchases as Qumu continues to support the growth of its business.\nWe cannot assure you that we will generate increases in our revenues consistent with our strategic plan, attain a level of profitable operations, generate cash from operations, or successfully implement our business plan or future business opportunities. Our business plan and capital needs are subject to change depending on, among other things, success of our efforts to grow revenue and our efforts to continue to effectively manage expenses. If we are ultimately unable to generate sufficient revenue to meet our financial targets, become profitable and have sustainable positive cash flows, we may be required to further reduce expenses, which could have a further negative effect on our ability to generate revenue.\nThe markets for video content and software to manage video content are each in early stages of development. If this market does not develop or develops more slowly than Qumu expects, including as a result of COVID-19 impacts, Qumu\u2019s revenues may decline or fail to grow.\nThe use of video as a mainstream communication and collaboration platform and the market for video content management software is in an early stage of development, and it is uncertain whether the use of video will achieve high levels of long-term acceptance. Widespread adoption and use of video in the enterprise is critical to Qumu\u2019s future growth and success. Likewise, it is uncertain whether video content management software will achieve high levels of demand and market adoption. Qumu\u2019s success will depend on enterprises adopting video as a platform and upon enterprise demand for software to help them capture, organize and distribute this content. Qumu believes that the COVID-19 crisis will act as a tipping point for the use and acceptance of video as a primary communication channel within the enterprise. As video content and software to manage video content achieve high levels of acceptance within the enterprise, we believe this will drive demand and market adoption for Qumu\u2019s video platform and tools. In particular, we have noted a trend toward new customers choosing Qumu\u2019s cloud-based enterprise video solution or existing customers converting to a cloud-based solution.\nDespite the changes in business practices caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, some customers may be reluctant or unwilling to use video as a medium within the enterprise for a number of reasons, including lack of perceived benefit of this new method of communication and existing investments in other enterprise-wide communications tools. Further, even if customers are using video as a medium, these customers may choose to rely upon their own IT infrastructure and resources to manage their video content. Because many companies generally are predisposed to maintaining control of their IT systems and infrastructure, there may be resistance to using software as a service provided by a third party. Privacy concerns and transition costs are also factors that may affect a potential customer\u2019s decision to subscribe to an external solution.\nAdditional factors that may limit market acceptance of Qumu\u2019s video content management software include:\n\u2022competitive dynamics may cause pricing levels to change as the market matures and cause customers to seek out lower priced alternatives to Qumu\u2019s video content management software or force Qumu to reduce the prices Qumu charges for its products or services; or\n\u2022existing and new market participants may introduce new types of solutions and different approaches to enable enterprises to address their enterprise communications or video communications needs and these disruptive technologies may reduce demand for Qumu\u2019s video content management software.\nIf customers do not perceive the benefits of Qumu\u2019s video content management software, or if customers are unwilling to accept video content as an alternative to other more traditional forms of enterprise communication, the market for Qumu\u2019s software might not continue to develop or might develop more slowly than Qumu expects, either of which would significantly adversely affect Qumu\u2019s financial results and prospects.\nFurther, there is no assurance that the COVID-19 crisis will result in substantial and sustained increased in use and acceptance of video as a primary communication channel or that this increased in use and acceptance of video will result in an increased demand among customers for Qumu\u2019s video platform and tools, either of which would significantly adversely affect Qumu\u2019s financial results and prospects.\nWe encounter long sales cycles with our enterprise video solutions, which could adversely affect our operating results in a given period.\nOur ability to increase revenues and achieve profitability depends, in large part, on widespread adoption of our enterprise video content management software products by businesses and other organizations. As we target our sales efforts at these customers, we face greater costs, longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing sales. In the large enterprise market, the customer\u2019s decision to use our products may be an enterprise-wide decision and, therefore, these types of sales require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our applications. Further, given the constant innovation with our industry and our products, customers may delay purchasing decisions until certain features or products in development are brought to market. Longer sales cycles could cause our operating and financial results to suffer in a given period.\nWe are subject to financial and other covenants related to our debt financing and if we fail to meet such covenants, it could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOn April 15, 2022, we entered into a loan and security agreement with Silicon Valley Bank providing for a revolving line of credit. The credit facility is available for cash borrowings, subject to a formula based upon 85% of eligible accounts receivable plus a portion not subject to such formula of $2.5 million. The non-formula amount is eliminated from available borrowings at the earlier of April 30, 2023 or the date on which the Company's net cash, as defined in the agreement, is less than $5.0 million.\nAdditionally, when the Company's net cash is less than $5.0 million, at which point the non-formula amount of $2.5 million would be eliminated from available borrowings and the interest rate on borrowed would increase from 1.50% above the prime rate to 2.00% above the prime rate. The loan and security agreement maintains certain reporting requirements, conditions, and covenants.\nPursuant to the loan and security agreement, the Company granted a security interest in substantially all of its properties, rights and assets (including certain equity interests of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries). The loan and security agreement contains customary events of default, upon the occurrence of which, the lender may accelerate repayment of any outstanding balance. The loan and security agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and requirements relating to the Company and its operations, including a requirement that the Company maintain an adjusted quick ratio, as defined in the agreement, greater than or equal to 1.25 to 1.00. Our monthly operations and resulting adjusted quick ratio are subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, and negative operating results may cause non-compliance with the adjusted quick ratio.\nAdditionally, the line of credit contains various provisions that limit our ability to, among other things, incur, create or assume certain indebtedness; create, incur or assume certain liens; make certain investments; make sales, transfers and dispositions of certain property; undergo certain fundamental changes, including certain mergers, liquidations and consolidations; purchase, hold or acquire certain investments; and declare or make certain dividends and distributions. These covenants may affect our ability to operate and finance our business as we deem appropriate.\nIf we are unable to meet our obligations as they become due or to comply with the financial covenants or other covenants contained in the line of credit, this could constitute an event of default under the loan and security agreement.\nIf there were an event of default under the loan and security agreement, the lender could declare any indebtedness immediately due and payable. In that case, we may need to refinance the line of credit indebtedness or seek capital from other sources to repay any accelerated debt. Even if we could obtain additional financing, the terms of the financing may not be favorable to us. In addition, substantially all of our assets are subject to liens securing the line of credit. If amounts outstanding under the line of credit were accelerated, the lender could foreclose on these liens and we could lose substantially all of our assets. Any event of default under the loan and security agreement could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTo compete effectively, we must continually improve existing products and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance.\nIn order to remain competitive and increase sales to customers, we must anticipate and adapt to the rapidly changing technologies in the enterprise video content management market, enhance our existing products and introduce new products to address the changing demands of our customers. If we fail to anticipate or respond to technological developments or customer requirements, or if we are significantly delayed in developing and introducing products, our revenues will decline.\nIf we fail to accurately predict customers\u2019 changing needs and emerging technological trends, our business could be harmed. We must commit significant resources and may incur obligations (such as royalty obligations) to develop new products and features before knowing whether our investments will result in products the market will accept and without knowing the levels of revenue, if any, that may be derived from these products. Some of our competitors have greater engineering and product development resources than we have, allowing them to develop a greater number of products or improvements or to develop them more quickly.\nIf we fail to anticipate or respond in a cost-effective and timely manner to technological developments, changes in industry standards or customer requirements, or if we experience any significant delays in the development or introduction of new products or improvements to existing products, our business, operating results and financial condition could be affected adversely.\nWe face intense competition and such competition may result in price reductions, lower gross profits and loss of market share.\nOur products face intense competition, both from other products and from other technologies, both in the U.S. and in international markets. We compete with others such as Kaltura, Brightcove, Vbrick and Vimeo who deliver video solutions to businesses. Qumu also encounters organizations utilizing Zoom, Cisco\u2019s WebEx and Microsoft\u2019s Teams and Streams technologies for video. While some view Zoom, WebEx and Teams as competitors to Qumu and some customers view their products as a partial alternative to Qumu\u2019s technology, we believe that the Zoom, WebEx and Teams and Qumu technologies can be seamlessly integrated and provide the customer with greater scale, security and flexibility and improved manageability than use of those technologies alone. Further, because some prospective customers may choose to rely upon their own IT infrastructure and resources to manage their video content, we compete with customer-created solutions for video content management. We expect the intensity of competition we face to increase in the future from other established and emerging companies.\nMany of our competitors have greater resources than we do, including greater sales, product development, marketing, financial, technical or engineering resources. In addition, because our enterprise video content management software business is operating within an evolving marketplace, our target customers may prefer to purchase software products that are critical to their business from one of our larger, more established competitors.\nTo remain competitive, we believe that we must continue to provide:\n\u2022technologically advanced products and solutions that anticipate and satisfy the demands of end-users;\n\u2022continuing advancements or innovations in our product offerings, including products with price-performance advantages or value-added features in security, reliability or other key areas of customer interest;\n\u2022innovations in video content creation, management, delivery and user experience;\n\u2022a responsive and effective sales force;\n\u2022a dependable and efficient sales distribution network;\n\u2022superior customer service; and\n\u2022high levels of quality and reliability.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors. Competition may result in price reductions, lower gross profit margins, increased discounts to customers and loss of market share, and could require increased spending by us on research and development, sales and marketing and customer support.\nEconomic and market conditions, particularly those affecting our customers, have harmed and may continue to harm our business.\nUnfavorable changes in economic conditions, including recession, inflation, lack of access to capital, lack of consumer confidence or other changes have resulted and may continue to result in lower spending among our customers and target customers.\nFurther, we sell our products throughout the United States, as well as in several international countries to commercial and government customers. Our business may be adversely affected by factors in the United States and other countries such as disruptions in financial markets, reductions in government spending, or downturns in economic activity in specific countries or regions, or in the various industries in which we operate; social, political or labor conditions in specific countries or regions; or adverse changes in the availability and cost of capital, interest rates, tax rates, or regulations. These factors are beyond our control but may result in further decreases in spending among customers and softening demand for our products.\nFurther, challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased. As a result, our cash flow may be negatively impacted and our allowance for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase.\nOur sales will decline, and our business will be materially harmed, if our sales and marketing efforts are not effective.\nWe will need to continue to grow and optimize our sales infrastructure in order to grow our customer base and our revenues. Identifying and recruiting qualified personnel and training them in the use and functionality of our software requires significant time, expense and attention. It can take six months or longer before our sales representatives are fully trained and productive. If we are unable to hire, develop and retain talented sales personnel or if new sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time, we may not be able to realize the expected benefits of this investment or increase our revenues. We also intend to expand new sales and customer success models that focus on different sales strategies tailored to different customer types and stages of our customers lifecycles. Our business may be adversely affected if our efforts to train our internal sales force or execute our selling strategies do not generate a corresponding increase in revenues.\nFor sales that are made to customers through our channel partners, we depend on these businesses to provide effective sales and marketing support to our products. Our channel partners are independent businesses that we do not control. Our agreements with channel partners do not contain requirements that a certain percentage of such parties\u2019 sales are of our products. These channel partners may choose to devote their efforts to other products in different markets or reduce or fail to devote the resources to provide effective sales and marketing support of our products, any of which could harm our business by reducing sales to customers.\nWe believe that our future growth and success will depend upon the success of our internal sales and marketing efforts as well as those of our channel partners.\nWe sell a significant portion of our products internationally, which exposes us to risks associated with international operations.\nWe sell a significant amount of our products to customers outside the United States, particularly in Europe and Asia. We expect that sales to international customers, including customers in Europe and Asia, will continue to account for a significant portion of our net sales. Sales outside the United States involve the following risks, among others:\n\u2022international governments may impose tariffs, quotas and taxes;\n\u2022public health emergencies, such as the recent coronavirus outbreak and the subsequent public health measures, may affect our employees, suppliers, customers and our ability to provide services and maintenance in the affected regions;\n\u2022the demand for our products will depend, in part, on local economic health;\n\u2022political and economic instability may reduce demand for our products;\n\u2022restrictions on the export or import of technology may reduce or eliminate our ability to sell in certain markets;\n\u2022potentially limited intellectual property protection in certain countries may limit our recourse against infringing products or cause us to refrain from selling in certain markets;\n\u2022potential difficulties in managing our international operations;\n\u2022the burden and cost of complying with a variety of international laws, including those relating to data security and privacy;\n\u2022we may decide to price our products in foreign currency denominations;\n\u2022our contracts with international channel partners cannot fully protect us against political and economic instability;\n\u2022potential difficulties in collecting receivables; and\n\u2022we may not be able to control our international channel partners\u2019 efforts on our behalf.\nThe financial results of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars for consolidation with our overall financial results. Currency translations and fluctuations may adversely affect the financial performance of our consolidated operations. Currency fluctuations may also increase the relative price of our product in international markets and thereby could also cause our products to become less affordable or less price competitive than those of international manufacturers. These risks associated with international operations may have a material adverse effect on our revenue from or costs associated with international sales.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted worldwide business practices and economic conditions and could have a material effect on Qumu\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, governmental authorities have implemented and are continuing to implement numerous and constantly evolving measures to try to contain the virus, such as vaccine distribution, travel bans and restrictions, limits on gatherings, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and business shutdowns.\nIn response to these developments, we have modified our business practices by restricting employee travel, moving to remote work, cancelling in-person attendance at events and conferences, and implementing social distancing. The resources available to our employees working remotely may not enable them to maintain the same level of productivity and efficiency, particularly our sales employees whose in-person access to our customers and customer prospects has been significantly limited. While we have experienced only limited absenteeism from employees, absenteeism may increase in the future and may harm our productivity. Due to customer demand, Qumu has and may in the future rely upon outsourced professional services, which could negatively impact margins.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic also has changed worldwide business practices as companies have implemented COVID-19 vaccine requirements, travel restrictions and work-from-home requirements. As part of these changes, enterprises of all sizes are implementing technology plans to virtualize customer meetings, employee communications and major events - as well as record and store video assets for on-demand viewing.\nQumu believes that the COVID-19 crisis will act as a tipping point for the use and acceptance of video as a primary communication channel within the enterprise. As video content and software to manage video content achieve high levels of acceptance within the enterprise, we believe this will drive demand and market adoption for Qumu\u2019s video platform and tools. Widespread adoption and use of video in the enterprise is critical to Qumu\u2019s future growth and success. However, there is no assurance that the COVID-19 crisis will result in substantial and sustained increased in use and acceptance of video as a primary communication channel or that this increased in use and acceptance of video will result in an increased demand among customers for Qumu\u2019s video platform and tools.\nRestrictions on the manufacturing, operations or workforce of our vendors and suppliers could limit our ability to meet customer demand for hardware purchased as a component of the overall Qumu solution, which would harm our ability to meet our delivery and installation obligations to customers and result in delayed or lost revenue and cash flow from collections. Furthermore, restrictions or disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability of air transport, port closures and increased border controls or closures, may result in higher costs and delays for supply of hardware, which could reduce our margins on hardware.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic slowed business decisions around procurement and new digital transformations in 2021. These pullbacks were higher than Qumu's management anticipated. Although we feel hybrid and remote work will increase in 2022, we cannot predict the amount of return to office, versus hybrid, versus work from wherever polices that our primary enterprises will settle on. This makes predicting the speed of growth more difficult.\nThe degree to which COVID-19 impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration and geographic spread of the outbreak, its severity, the actions to contain the virus and address its impact, travel restrictions imposed, business closures or business disruption, and the actions taken throughout the world, to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact.\nRisks Relating to Our Technology\nOur enterprise video content management software products must be successfully integrated into our customers\u2019 information technology environments and workflows, and changes to these environments, workflows or unforeseen combinations of technologies may harm our customers\u2019 experience in using our software products.\nA significant portion of our sales are made into applications that require our enterprise video content management software products to be integrated into other enterprise workflows, enterprise information technology environments or software functionalities. Any significant changes to enterprise workflows, IT environments or software programs may limit the use or functionality of or demand for our products. As our customers advance technologically, we must be able to effectively integrate our products to remain competitive. Further, current and potential customers may choose to use products offered by our competitors or may not purchase our products if our products would require changes in their existing enterprise workflows, IT environments or software.\nThe growth and functionality of our enterprise video content management software products depend upon the solution\u2019s effective operation with mobile operating systems and computer networks.\nOur products are currently compatible with various mobile operating systems including the iOS, Windows Mobile and Android operating systems. The functionality of our products depends upon the continued interoperability of these products with popular mobile operating systems. Any changes in these systems that degrade our products\u2019 functionality or give preferential treatment to competitive offerings could adversely affect the operability and usage of our video management software products on mobile devices. Additionally, in order to deliver a high-quality user experience, it is important that our products work well with a range of mobile technologies, systems, and networks. We may not be successful in keeping pace with changes in mobile technologies, operating systems, or networks or in developing products that operate effectively within existing or future technologies, systems, and networks. Further, any significant changes to mobile operating systems by their respective developers may prevent our products from working properly or at all on these systems. In the event that it is more difficult for users to access content delivered by our solutions to their mobile devices, if our products do not operate effectively within the most popular operating systems or if popular mobile devices do not offer a high-quality user experience, sales of and customer demand for our software products could be harmed.\nComputer malware, viruses, hacking, phishing attacks, spamming, and other cyber-threats could harm our business and cause customers to lose confidence in us and our products, which could significantly impact our business and results of operations.\nComputer malware, viruses, computer hacking, phishing attacks, social engineering, and other electronic threats have become more prevalent, have occurred on our systems in the past, and may occur on our systems in the future. While we are taking measures to safeguard our solutions and services from cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities, cyber-attacks and other security incidents continue to evolve in sophistication and frequency. The connection of our software solutions to our customers and their information technology environments could present the opportunity for an attack on our systems to serve as a way to obtain access into our customers\u2019 systems, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and growth prospects. Our security measures may also be breached due to employee or other error, intentional malfeasance and other third-party acts, and system errors or vulnerabilities, including vulnerabilities of our third-party vendors, customers, or otherwise. Businesses have experienced material sales declines after discovering data breaches, and our business could be similarly impacted. The costs to continuously improve the security of our solutions and reduce the likelihood of a successful attack are high and may continue to increase. Furthermore, some U.S. states and international jurisdictions have enacted laws requiring companies to notify consumers of data security breaches involving their personal data. These mandatory disclosures regarding a security breach often lead to widespread negative publicity, which may cause our customers to lose confidence in the effectiveness of the data security measures of our solutions. Any negative incidents can quickly erode trust and confidence, particularly if they result in adverse mainstream and social media publicity, governmental investigations or litigation. Though it\nis difficult to determine what, if any, harm may directly result from any specific interruption or attack, any failure to maintain performance, reliability, security and availability of our products and technical infrastructure to the satisfaction of our customers may harm our reputation, impair our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers and expose us to legal claims and government action, each of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nExpanding laws, regulations and customer requirements relating to data security and privacy may adversely affect sales of our products and result in increased compliance costs.\nOur customers can use our products to collect, use and store personal or identifying information regarding their employees, customers and suppliers. Federal, state and international government bodies and agencies have adopted, are considering adopting, or may adopt laws and regulations regarding data security, privacy and the collection, use, storage and disclosure of personal information obtained from consumers and individuals. These laws and regulations could reduce the demand for our software products if we fail to design or enhance our products to enable our customers to comply with the privacy and security measures required by the legislation.\nWe also must comply with the policies, procedures and business requirements of our customers relating to data privacy and security, which can vary based upon the customer, the customer\u2019s industry or location, and the product the customer selects, and which may be more restrictive than the privacy and security measures required by law or regulation. In particular, the European Union and many countries in Europe have stringent privacy laws and regulations, which may impact our ability to profitably operate in certain European countries or to offer products that meet the needs of customers subject to European Union privacy laws and regulations. Likewise, the California Consumer Privacy Act is a state law intended to enhance privacy rights and consumer protection that may impact our ability to profitably operate across the United States given that our customers\u2019 employees may be resident in California or to offer products that meet the needs of customers subject to California privacy laws and regulations.\nThe costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, our customers\u2019 own requirements and the privacy and security laws and regulations that are applicable to our customers\u2019 businesses may limit the use and adoption of our products and reduce overall demand. Non-compliance with our customers\u2019 specific requirements may lead to termination of contracts with these customers or liabilities to the customers; non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations may lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities.\nFurthermore, privacy concerns may cause our customers\u2019 workers to resist providing the personal data necessary to allow our customers to use our products effectively. If a customer experiences a significant data security breach involving our software products, our customers could lose confidence in our software\u2019s ability to protect the personal information of their employees, customers and suppliers, which could cause our customers to discontinue use of our products. The loss of confidence from a significant data security breach involving our software products could hurt our reputation, cause sales and marketing challenges to existing and new customers, cause loss of market share or exacerbate competitive pressures, result in an increase in our development costs to address any potential vulnerabilities in our software products, and may result in reduced demand and revenue. Even the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our products in certain industries.\nDomestic and international legislative and regulatory initiatives and our customers\u2019 privacy policies and practices may adversely affect our customers\u2019 ability to process, handle, store, use and transmit demographic and personal information from their employees, customers and suppliers, which could reduce demand for our products.\nIn addition to government activity, privacy advocacy groups and the technology and other industries are considering various new, additional or different self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on our software products. If the processing of personal information were to be curtailed in this manner, our software products would be less effective, which may reduce demand for our products and adversely affect our business.\nAny failure of major elements of our products could lead to significant disruptions in our ability to serve customers, which could damage our reputation, reduce our revenues or otherwise harm our business.\nOur business is dependent upon providing customers with fast, efficient and reliable services. A reduction in the performance, reliability or availability of required network infrastructure may harm our ability to distribute content to our customers, as well as our reputation and ability to attract and retain customers. Our content management software solutions and operations are susceptible to, and could be damaged or interrupted by, outages caused by fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, Internet or mobile network breakdown, earthquake and similar events. Our solutions are also subject to human error, security breaches, power losses, computer viruses, break-ins, \u201cdenial of service\u201d attacks, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and tampering designed to disrupt our computer systems and network communications. Our failure to protect our network against\ndamage from any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations also depend on web browsers, ISPs (Internet service providers) and mobile networks to provide our customers\u2019 end-users with access to websites, streaming and mobile content. Many of these providers have experienced outages in the past, and could experience outages, delays and other difficulties due to system failures unrelated to our solutions. Any such outage, delay or difficulty could adversely affect our ability to effectively provide our products and services, which would harm our business.\nIf we lose access to third-party licenses, our software product development and production may be delayed or we may incur additional expense to modify our products or products in development.\nSome of our solutions contain software licensed from third parties. Third-party licensing arrangements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u2022undetected errors or unauthorized use of another person\u2019s code in the third party\u2019s software;\n\u2022disagreement over the scope of the license and other key terms, such as royalties payable;\n\u2022infringement actions brought by third-party licensees;\n\u2022that third parties will create solutions that directly compete with our products; and\n\u2022termination or expiration of the license.\nBecause of these risks, some of these licenses may not be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable to us or allow our products to remain competitive. The loss of these licenses or the inability to maintain any of them on commercially acceptable terms could delay development of future products or impair the functionality or enhancement of existing products, leading to increased expense associated with licenses of third-party software or development of alternative software to provide comparable functionality for our existing products and modification of our existing products. Further, if we lose or are unable to maintain any of these third-party licenses or are required to modify software obtained under third-party licenses, it could delay the release of new products, delay enhancements to our existing products or delay sales of our existing products. Any delays could result in loss of competitive position, loss of sales and loss of customer confidence, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf the limited amount of open source software that is incorporated into our products were to become unavailable or if we violate the terms of open source licenses, it could adversely affect sales of our products, which could disrupt our business and harm our financial results.\nOur products incorporate a limited amount of \u201copen source\u201d software. Open source software is made available to us and to the public by its authors or other third parties under licenses that impose certain obligations on licensees that re-distribute or make derivative works of the open source software. We may not be able to replace the functionality provided by the open source software currently incorporated in our products if that software becomes unavailable, obsolete or incompatible with future versions of our products. In addition, we must carefully monitor our compliance with the licensing requirements applicable to that open source software. If we have failed or if in the future we fail to comply with the applicable license requirements, we might lose the right to use the subject open source software. The terms of some open source licenses would require us to give our customers significant rights to open source software that is subject to those licenses and is incorporated in our products. This would include the right to obtain from us the source code form of that open source software, and the right to use, modify and distribute that open source software to others. We may be required to provide these rights to customers on a royalty-free basis. Those rights might also extend to modifications and additions we make to the subject open source software. That open source software, and those modifications and additions, also might be obtained by our competitors and used in competing products.\nThe enforceability and interpretation of open source licenses remain uncertain under applicable law. Unfavorable court decisions could require us to replace open source software incorporated in our products. In some cases this might require us to obtain licenses to commercial software under terms that restrict our use of that commercial software and require us to pay royalties. In some cases we might need to redesign our software products, or to discontinue the sale of our software products if a redesign could not be accomplished on a timely basis. These same consequences result if our use of any open source software or commercial software is found to infringe any intellectual property right of another party. Any of these occurrences would harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf our domestic or international intellectual property rights are not adequately protected, others may offer products similar to ours or independently develop the same or similar technologies or otherwise obtain access to our technology and trade secrets, which could depress our product selling prices and gross profit or result in loss of market share.\nWe believe that protecting our proprietary technology is important to our success and competitive positioning. In addition to common law intellectual property rights, we rely on patents, trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights, know-how, license agreements and contractual provisions to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. However, these legal means afford us only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or remedies to gain or keep any advantages we may have over our competitors.\nOur competitors, who may have or could develop or acquire significant resources, may make substantial investments in competing technologies, or may apply for and obtain patents that will prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to develop or market our products. Further, although we do not believe that any of our products infringe on the rights of others, third parties have claimed, and may claim in the future, that our products infringe on their rights, and these third parties may assert infringement claims against us in the future.\nCostly litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us, to protect trade secrets or \u201cknow-how\u201d we own, to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others or to determine the ownership, scope, or validity of our proprietary rights and the rights of others. Any claim of infringement against us may involve significant liabilities to third parties, could require us to seek licenses from third parties, and could prevent us from manufacturing, selling, or using our products. The occurrence of this litigation, or the effect of an adverse determination in any of this type of litigation, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, the laws of some of the countries in which our products are or may be sold may not protect our products and intellectual property to the same extent as the United States or at all. Our failure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in laws and regulations related to the Internet or changes in the Internet infrastructure itself may diminish the demand for our products and could have a negative impact on our business.\nThe future success of our business depends in part upon the continued use of the Internet as a primary medium for commerce, communication and business applications. Federal, state or international government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted, and may in the future adopt, laws or regulations affecting the use of the Internet as a commercial medium. Changes in these laws or regulations could require us to modify our products in order to comply with these changes. In addition, government agencies or private organizations may begin to impose taxes, fees or other charges for accessing the Internet or commerce conducted via the Internet. These laws or charges could limit the growth of Internet-related commerce or communications generally or result in reductions in the demand for Internet-based applications such as ours. The adoption of any laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth, popularity or use of the Internet could limit the growth of the video as a mainstream communication and collaboration tool, limit the market for video content management software generally, and limit the demand for our products.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nWe may experience significant quarterly and annual fluctuations in our results of operations due to a number of factors and these fluctuations may negatively impact the market price of our common stock.\nOur quarterly and annual results of operations may fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. This variability may lead to volatility in our stock price as research analysts and investors respond to quarterly fluctuations and this volatility may be exacerbated by the relatively illiquid nature of our common stock. In addition, comparing our results of operations on a period-to-period basis, particularly on a sequential quarterly basis, may not be meaningful. You should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. Factors that may affect our results of operations include:\n\u2022the number and mix of products and solutions sold in the period;\n\u2022the timing and amount of our recorded revenue, which will depend upon the mix of products and solutions selected by our customers with revenue from paid-up perpetual software licenses being recognized upon delivery, revenue from term software licenses recognized over the term of the contract, and revenue from cloud-hosted services recognized over the term of the subscription agreement;\n\u2022timing of customer purchase commitments, including the impact of long sales cycles and seasonal buying patterns;\n\u2022timing of customer payments, including customer decisions to pre-pay;\n\u2022variability in the size of customer purchases and the impact of large customer orders on a particular period;\n\u2022the timing of major development projects and market launch of new products or improvements to existing products;\n\u2022reductions in our customers\u2019 budgets for information technology purchases and delays in their purchasing cycles, due to changing global economic or market conditions;\n\u2022the impact to the marketplace of competitive products and pricing;\n\u2022the timing and level of operating expenses;\n\u2022the impact on revenue and expenses of acquisitions by us or by our competitors;\n\u2022future accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies; and\n\u2022the impact of a recession or any other adverse global economic conditions on our business, including uncertainties that may cause a delay in entering into or a failure to enter into significant customer agreements.\nThe foregoing factors are difficult to forecast, and these, as well as other factors, could adversely affect our quarterly and annual results of operations. Failure to achieve our quarterly or annual forecasts or to meet or exceed the expectations of research analysts or investors may cause our stock price to decline abruptly and significantly.\nThe limited trading volume of our common stock could affect your ability to sell your shares at a satisfactory price.\nWe have historically experienced a limited trading volume in our common stock. A more active public market for our common stock may not develop, which could adversely affect the trading price and liquidity of our common stock. Moreover, a thin trading market for our stock could cause the market price for our common stock to fluctuate significantly more than the stock market as a whole. Without a larger float, our common stock is less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership. As a result, the trading prices of our common stock have been and may continue to be more volatile. In addition, in the absence of an active public trading market, shareholders may be unable to liquidate their shares of our common stock at a satisfactory price.\nProvisions of Minnesota law, our bylaws and other agreements may deter a change of control of our company and may have a possible negative effect on our stock price.\nCertain provisions of Minnesota law, our bylaws and other agreements may make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire, or discourage a third-party from attempting to acquire, control of our company, including:\n\u2022the provisions of Minnesota law relating to business combinations and control share acquisitions;\n\u2022the provisions of our bylaws regarding the business properly brought before shareholders;\n\u2022the right of our board of directors to establish more than one class or series of shares and to fix the relative rights and preferences of any such different classes or series;\n\u2022the provisions of our stock incentive plan allowing for the acceleration of vesting or payments of awards granted under the plan in the event of specified events that result in a \u201cchange in control\u201d and the provisions of our outstanding awards requiring acceleration of vesting or payments of those awards in the event of a \u201cchange in control\u201d; and\n\u2022the provisions of our agreements provide for severance payments to our executive officers and other officers and the accelerated vesting or payment of their awards in the event of certain terminations following a \u201cchange in control.\u201d\nThese measures could discourage or prevent a takeover of our company or changes in our management, even if an acquisition or such changes would be beneficial to our shareholders. This may have a negative effect on the price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 78054, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "QUMU"}
