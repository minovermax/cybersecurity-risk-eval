{"cik": "874015", "company": "IONIS PHARMACEUTICALS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the following information about the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this report and in our other public filings in evaluating our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business could be materially harmed, and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. As a result, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you might lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Associated with our Ionis Core and Akcea Therapeutics Businesses\nIf the market does not accept our medicines, including SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA, we are not likely to generate revenues or become consistently profitable.\nEven if our medicines are authorized for marketing, including SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA, our success will depend upon the medical community, patients and third-party payors accepting our medicines as medically useful, cost-effective and safe. Even when the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities authorize our or our partners\u2019 medicines for commercialization, doctors may not prescribe our medicines to treat patients. We and our partners may not successfully commercialize additional medicines.\nAdditionally, in many of the markets where we may sell our medicines in the future, if we cannot agree with the government regarding the price we can charge for our medicines, then we may not be able to sell our medicines in that market. Similarly, cost control initiatives by governments or third-party payors could decrease the price received for our medicines or increase patient coinsurance to a level that makes our medicines, including SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA, unaffordable.\nThe degree of market acceptance for our medicines, including SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA, depends upon a number of factors, including the:\n\u25cf\nreceipt and scope of marketing authorizations;\n\u25cf\nestablishment and demonstration in the medical and patient community of the efficacy and safety of our medicines and their potential advantages over competing products;\n\u25cf\ncost and effectiveness of our medicines compared to other available therapies;\n\u25cf\npatient convenience of the dosing regimen for our medicines; and\n\u25cf\nreimbursement policies of government and third-party payors.\nBased on the profile of our medicines, physicians, patients, patient advocates, payors or the medical community in general may not accept and/or use any medicines that we may develop.\nFor example, the product label for TEGSEDI in the U.S. has a boxed warning for thrombocytopenia and glomerulonephritis, requires periodic blood and urine monitoring, and TEGSEDI has a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, program. Our main competition in the U.S. market for TEGSEDI is ONPATTRO (patisiran), marketed by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Although ONPATTRO requires intravenous administration and pre-treatment with steroids, it does not have a boxed warning or REMS. Additionally, in the clinical studies with WAYLIVRA, declines in platelet counts were observed in many patients and some patients discontinued the studies because of platelet declines. Therefore, we expect the product label for WAYLIVRA will require periodic blood monitoring. In each case, these label requirements could negatively affect our ability to attract and retain patients for these medicines. We believe that the enhanced monitoring we have implemented to support early detection and management of these issues can help manage these safety issues so that patients can continue treatment. Since implementation of the enhanced monitoring, serious platelet events have been infrequent. While we believe we and Akcea can better maintain patients on TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA through patient-centric commercial approaches where we plan to have greater involvement with physicians and patients, if we cannot effectively maintain patients on TEGSEDI or WAYLIVRA, we may not be able to generate substantial revenue from TEGSEDI or WAYLIVRA sales.\nIf we or our partners fail to compete effectively, our medicines, including SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA, will not contribute significant revenues.\nOur competitors engage in drug discovery throughout the world, are numerous, and include, among others, major pharmaceutical companies and specialized biopharmaceutical firms. Other companies engage in developing antisense technology. Our competitors may succeed in developing medicines that are:\n\u25cf\npriced lower than our medicines;\n\u25cf\nreimbursed more favorably by government and other third-party payors than our medicines;\n\u25cf\nsafer than our medicines;\n\u25cf\nmore effective than our medicines; or\n\u25cf\nmore convenient to use than our medicines.\nThese competitive developments could make our medicines, including SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA, obsolete or non-competitive.\nCertain of our partners are pursuing other technologies or developing other medicines either on their own or in collaboration with others, including our competitors, to treat the same diseases our own collaborative programs target. Competition may negatively impact a partner\u2019s focus on and commitment to our medicines and, as a result, could delay or otherwise negatively affect the commercialization of our medicines, including SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA.\nMany of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do. In addition, many of these competitors have significantly greater experience than we do in conducting preclinical testing and human clinical studies of new pharmaceutical products, in obtaining FDA and other regulatory authorizations of such products and in commercializing such products. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining regulatory authorization for products earlier than we do. Marketing and sales capability is another factor relevant to the competitive position of our medicines, and we will primarily rely on our partners and Akcea to provide this capability.\nThere are several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies engaged in the development or commercialization of products against targets that are also targets of products in our development pipeline. For example, Zolgensma (AVXS-101), Risdiplam (RG7916), Reldesemtiv and Firdapse could compete with SPINRAZA, and ONPATTRO (approved in the U.S. and Europe for a similar indication as TEGSEDI), Tafamadis, AG10, CRX-1008 and Vutrisiran could compete with TEGSEDI. Also, Metreleptin and Gemcabene could compete with WAYLIVRA, while Laquinimod, OMS823, Selistat, VX15, WVE-120101 and WVE-120102 could compete with IONIS-HTTRx.\nFollowing approval, our medicines, including SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA could be subject to regulatory limitations.\nFollowing approval of a medicine, we and our partners must comply with comprehensive government regulations regarding the manufacture, marketing and distribution of drug products. We or our partners may not obtain the labeling claims necessary or desirable to successfully commercialize our drug products, including SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA.\nThe FDA and foreign regulatory authorities have the authority to impose significant restrictions on an approved drug product through the product label and on advertising, promotional and distribution activities. For example:\n\u25cf\nIn the U.S., TEGSEDI\u2019s label contains a boxed warning for thrombocytopenia and glomerulonephritis;\n\u25cf\nTEGSEDI requires periodic blood and urine monitoring; and\n\u25cf\nin the U.S. TEGSEDI is available only through a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, program.\nIn addition, when approved, the FDA or a foreign regulatory authority may condition approval on the performance of post-approval clinical studies or patient monitoring, which could be time consuming and expensive. If the results of such post-marketing studies are not satisfactory, the FDA or a foreign regulatory authority may withdraw marketing authorization or may condition continued marketing on commitments from us or our partners that may be expensive and/or time consuming to fulfill.\nIf we or others identify side effects after any of our drug products are on the market, or if manufacturing problems occur subsequent to regulatory approval, we or our partners may lose regulatory approval, or we or our partners may need to conduct additional clinical studies and/or change the labeling of our drug products, including SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA.\nWe depend on our collaboration with Biogen for the development and commercialization of SPINRAZA.\nWe have entered into a collaborative arrangement with Biogen to develop and commercialize SPINRAZA. We entered into this collaboration primarily to:\n\u25cf\nfund our development activities for SPINRAZA;\n\u25cf\nseek and obtain regulatory approvals for SPINRAZA; and\n\u25cf\nsuccessfully commercialize SPINRAZA.\nWe are relying on Biogen to obtain additional regulatory approvals for SPINRAZA, and successfully commercialize SPINRAZA. In general, we cannot control the amount and timing of resources that Biogen devotes to our collaboration. If Biogen fails to further develop SPINRAZA, obtain additional regulatory approvals for SPINRAZA, or commercialize SPINRAZA, or if Biogen\u2019s efforts are not effective, our business may be negatively affected.\nOur collaboration with Biogen may not continue for various reasons. Biogen can terminate our collaboration at any time. If Biogen stops developing or commercializing SPINRAZA, we would have to seek or spend additional funding, and SPINRAZA\u2019s commercialization may be harmed or delayed.\nOur collaboration with Biogen may not result in the continued successful commercialization of SPINRAZA. If Biogen does not continue to successfully commercialize SPINRAZA, we will receive limited revenues for SPINRAZA.\nIf Akcea cannot optimize and maintain effective marketing and sales capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell TEGSEDI, we may not generate significant product revenue from TEGSEDI.\nTo successfully commercialize TEGSEDI Akcea must successfully manage its marketing, sales and distribution capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services. Akcea may not be successful in doing so. To commercialize TEGSEDI in the initial indications Akcea is pursuing, Akcea will need to optimize and maintain a specialty sales force in each global region it expects to market TEGSEDI, supported by case managers, reimbursement specialists, partnerships with specialty pharmacies, injection training, routine blood and urine monitoring and a medical affairs team. Akcea may seek to further penetrate markets by expanding its sales force or through strategic partnerships with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies or third-party sales organizations.\nEven though certain members of Akcea\u2019s management team and other employees have experience commercializing drug products, Akcea has no prior experience marketing, selling or distributing drug products, and there are significant risks involved in building and managing a commercial infrastructure. It will be expensive and time consuming for Akcea to maintain its own sales force and related compliance protocols to market TEGSEDI. Akcea may never successfully optimize or manage this capability and any failure could preclude the successful commercialization of TEGSEDI. Akcea and its partners, if any, will have to compete with other companies to recruit, hire, train, manage and retain marketing and sales personnel.\nAkcea incurred expenses prior to the launch of TEGSEDI to integrate and manage the associated marketing and sales infrastructure. If regulatory requirements or other factors cause the commercial launch of TEGSEDI to be less successful than expected, Akcea will have incurred expenses for having invested in these capabilities prior to realizing any significant revenue from sales of TEGSEDI. Akcea\u2019s sales force and marketing teams may not successfully commercialize TEGSEDI.\nTo the extent we and Akcea decide to rely on third parties to commercialize TEGSEDI in a particular geographic market, such as the collaboration Akcea has with PTC Therapeutics to commercialize TEGSEDI in Latin America, we may receive less revenue than if Akcea commercialized TEGSEDI by itself. Further we would have less control over the sales efforts of any other third parties involved in commercializing TEGSEDI.\nIf Akcea cannot effectively build and manage its distribution, medical affairs, market access, marketing and sales infrastructure, or find a suitable third party to perform such functions, the commercial launch and sales of TEGSEDI may be delayed, less successful or precluded. Such events may result in decreased sales and lower revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf government or other third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and payment rates for our medicines, including SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA, our revenue will be limited.\nIn both domestic and foreign markets, sales of our current and future products will depend in part upon the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. The majority of people in the U.S. who would fit within our target patient populations for our medicines have their healthcare supported by a combination of Medicare coverage, other government health programs such as Medicaid, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Coverage decisions may depend upon clinical and economic standards that disfavor new drug products when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are already available or subsequently become available. Assuming coverage is approved, the resulting reimbursement payment rates might not be enough to make our medicines affordable.\nThird-party payors, whether foreign or domestic, or governmental or commercial, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. In addition, in the U.S., no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. Further, we believe that future coverage and reimbursement will likely be subject to increased restrictions both in the U.S. and in international markets. For example, in the U.S., recent health reform measures have resulted in reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, and there have been several U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed federal legislation designed to, among other things, reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products and bring more transparency to drug pricing. Third-party coverage and reimbursement for our products or medicines may not be available or adequate in either the U.S. or international markets, which would negatively affect the potential commercial success of our products, our revenue and our profits.\nIf Biogen cannot manufacture finished drug product for SPINRAZA or the post-launch supply of the active drug substance for SPINRAZA, SPINRAZA may not maintain commercial success.\nBiogen is responsible for the long-term supply of both SPINRAZA drug substance and finished drug product. Biogen may not be able to reliably manufacture SPINRAZA drug substance and drug product to support the long-term commercialization of SPINRAZA. If Biogen cannot reliably manufacture SPINRAZA drug substance and drug product, SPINRAZA may not maintain commercial success, which will harm our ability to generate revenue.\nIf we or our partners fail to obtain regulatory approval for our medicines, including WAYLIVRA, and additional approvals for SPINRAZA and TEGSEDI, we or our partners cannot sell them in the applicable markets.\nWe cannot guarantee that any of our medicines, including WAYLIVRA, will be considered safe and effective, or will be approved for commercialization. In addition, we cannot guarantee that SPINRAZA and TEGSEDI will be approved in additional markets or for additional indications. We and our partners must conduct time-consuming, extensive and costly clinical studies to show the safety and efficacy of each of our medicines before they can be approved for sale. We must conduct these studies in compliance with FDA regulations and with comparable regulations in other countries.\nWe and our partners may not obtain necessary regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all, for our medicines. It is possible that regulatory agencies will not approve our medicines, including WAYLIVRA, for marketing or additional marketing authorizations for SPINRAZA or TEGSEDI. If the FDA or another regulatory agency believes that we or our partners have not sufficiently demonstrated the safety or efficacy of any of our medicines, including SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA, the agency will not approve the specific medicine or will require additional studies, which can be time consuming and expensive and which will delay or harm commercialization of the medicine. For example, Akcea received a CRL from the FDA and a preliminary notice of noncompliance withdrawal letter from Health Canada for WAYLIVRA. As result, Akcea may need to submit additional data to the FDA and Health Canada or conduct additional clinical studies before obtaining marketing authorization, which would be expensive and cause delays. The CHMP of the EMA has adopted a positive opinion recommending conditional marketing authorization of WAYLIVRA as an adjunct to diet in adult patients with genetically confirmed FCS who are at high risk for pancreatitis, in whom response to diet and triglyceride lowering therapy has been inadequate. The positive opinion will now be referred to the EC, which grants marketing authorization for medicines in the European Union, as well as to European Economic Area members Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, however, the EC may decide not to adopt the CHMP\u2019s positive opinion.\nFailure to receive marketing authorization for WAYLIVRA or our other medicines, or failure to receive additional marketing authorizations for SPINRAZA or TEGSEDI, or delays in these authorizations could prevent or delay commercial introduction of the medicine, and, as a result, could negatively impact our ability to generate revenue from product sales.\nIf the results of clinical testing indicate that any of our medicines are not suitable for commercial use we may need to abandon one or more of our drug development programs.\nDrug discovery and development has inherent risks and the historical failure rate for drugs is high. Antisense drugs are a relatively new approach to therapeutics. If we cannot demonstrate that our medicines are safe and effective for human use, we may need to abandon one or more of our drug development programs.\nIn the past, we have invested in clinical studies of medicines that have not met the primary clinical end points in their Phase 3 studies. Similar results could occur in clinical studies for our medicines, including the study of WAYLIVRA in patients with FPL and the study of IONIS-HTTRx in patients with Huntington\u2019s disease. If any of our medicines in clinical studies, including WAYLIVRA and IONIS-HTTRx, do not show sufficient efficacy in patients with the targeted indication, it could negatively impact our development and commercialization goals for these medicines and our stock price could decline.\nEven if our medicines are successful in preclinical and human clinical studies, the medicines may not be successful in late-stage clinical studies.\nSuccessful results in preclinical or initial human clinical studies, including the Phase 2 results for some of our medicines in development, may not predict the results of subsequent clinical studies, including the Phase 3 study of WAYLIVRA in patients with FPL and the pivotal study of IONIS-HTTRx in patients with Huntington\u2019s disease. There are a number of factors that could cause a clinical study to fail or be delayed, including:\n\u25cf\nthe clinical study may produce negative or inconclusive results;\n\u25cf\nregulators may require that we hold, suspend or terminate clinical research for noncompliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf\nwe, our partners, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities could suspend or terminate a clinical study due to adverse side effects of a medicine on subjects in the trial;\n\u25cf\nwe may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional preclinical testing or clinical studies;\n\u25cf\nenrollment in our clinical studies may be slower than we anticipate;\n\u25cf\npeople who enroll in the clinical study may later drop out due to adverse events, a perception they are not benefiting from participating in the study, fatigue with the clinical study process or personal issues;\n\u25cf\nthe cost of our clinical studies may be greater than we anticipate; and\n\u25cf\nthe supply or quality of our medicines or other materials necessary to conduct our clinical studies may be insufficient, inadequate or delayed.\nIn addition, our current medicines, including SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA, are chemically similar to each other. As a result, a safety observation we encounter with one of our medicines could have, or be perceived by a regulatory authority to have, an impact on a different drug we are developing. This could cause the FDA and other regulators to ask questions or take actions that could harm or delay our ability to develop and commercialize our medicines or increase our costs. For example, the FDA or other regulatory agencies could request, among other things, any of the following regarding one of our medicines: additional information or commitments before we can start or continue a clinical study, protocol amendments, increased safety monitoring, additional product labeling information, and post-approval commitments. Similarly, we have an ongoing Phase 3 study of WAYLIVRA in patients with FPL, an ongoing open-label extension study of WAYLIVRA in patients with FCS, an ongoing open-label extension study of TEGSEDI and expanded access programs for each medicine. Adverse events or results from these studies could negatively impact our current or planned marketing approval applications for WAYLIVRA in patients with FCS or the commercial opportunity for each product.\nAny failure or delay in the clinical studies, including the Phase 3 study for WAYLIVRA in patients with FPL and the pivotal study of IONIS-HTTRx in patients with Huntington\u2019s disease, could reduce the commercial potential or viability of our medicines.\nIf we cannot manufacture our medicines or contract with a third party to manufacture our medicines at costs that allow us to charge competitive prices to buyers, we cannot market our products profitably.\nTo successfully commercialize any of our medicines, we or our partner would need to establish large-scale commercial manufacturing capabilities either on our own or through a third-party manufacturer. We and Akcea will rely on third-party manufacturers to supply the drug substance and drug product for TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA. In addition, as our drug development pipeline increases and matures, we will have a greater need for clinical trial and commercial manufacturing capacity. We have limited experience manufacturing pharmaceutical products of the chemical class represented by our medicines, called oligonucleotides, on a commercial scale for the systemic administration of a medicine. There are a small number of suppliers for certain capital equipment and raw materials that we use to manufacture our medicines, and some of these suppliers will need to increase their scale of production to meet our projected needs for commercial manufacturing. Further, we must continue to improve our manufacturing processes to allow us to reduce our drug costs. We may not be able to manufacture our medicines at a cost or in quantities necessary to make commercially successful products.\nAlso, manufacturers, including us, must adhere to the FDA\u2019s current Good Manufacturing Practices regulations and similar regulations in foreign countries, which the applicable regulatory authorities enforce through facilities inspection programs. We and our contract manufacturers may not comply or maintain compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices, or similar foreign regulations. Non-compliance could significantly delay or prevent receipt of marketing authorization for our medicines, including authorizations for SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA, or result in enforcement action after authorization that could limit the commercial success of our medicines, including SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA.\nWe depend on third parties to conduct our clinical studies for our medicines and any failure of those parties to fulfill their obligations could adversely affect our development and commercialization plans.\nWe depend on independent clinical investigators, contract research organizations and other third-party service providers to conduct our clinical studies for our medicines and expect to continue to do so in the future. For example, we use clinical research organizations, such as Icon Clinical Research Limited, INC Research Toronto, Inc. and Medpace for the clinical studies for our medicines, including TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA. We rely heavily on these parties for successful execution of our clinical studies, but do not control many aspects of their activities. For example, the investigators are not our employees. However, we are responsible for ensuring that these third parties conduct each of our clinical studies in accordance with the general investigational plan and approved protocols for the study. Third parties may not complete activities on schedule or may not conduct our clinical studies in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols. The failure of these third parties to carry out their obligations or a termination of our relationship with these third parties could delay or prevent the development, marketing authorization and commercialization of our medicines, including authorizations for WAYLIVRA or additional authorizations for SPINRAZA and TEGSEDI.\nRisks Associated with our Businesses as a Whole\nWe have incurred losses, and our business will suffer if we fail to consistently achieve profitability in the future.\nBecause drug discovery and development requires substantial lead-time and money prior to commercialization, our expenses have historically exceeded our revenue since we were founded in January 1989. As of December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $1.0 billion and stockholders\u2019 equity of approximately $1,187.2 million. Most of our historical losses resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs and from selling, general and administrative costs associated with our operations. Most of our income has come from collaborative arrangements, including commercial revenue from royalties and R&D revenue, with additional income from research grants and the sale or licensing of our patents, as well as interest income. If we do not continue to earn substantial revenue, we may incur additional operating losses in the future. We may not successfully develop any additional products or achieve or sustain future profitability.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryovers and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nUnder the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, a corporation is generally allowed a deduction for net operating losses, or NOLs, carried over from a prior taxable year. Under that provision, we can carryforward our NOLs to offset our future taxable income, if any, until such NOLs are used or expire. The same is true of other unused tax attributes, such as tax credits.\nUnder the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Act, federal net operating losses incurred in 2018 and in future years may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such federal net operating losses is limited. It is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the newly enacted federal tax law.\nIn addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d which is generally defined as a greater than 50 percent change, by value, in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. We may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control. If an ownership change occurs and our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes is materially limited, it would harm our future operating results by effectively increasing our future tax obligations.\nSince corporate partnering is a significant part of our strategy to fund the development and commercialization of our development programs, if any of our collaborative partners fail to fund our collaborative programs, or if we cannot obtain additional partners, we may have to delay or stop progress on our drug development programs.\nTo date, corporate partnering has played a significant role in our strategy to fund our development programs and to add key development resources. We plan to continue to rely on additional collaborative arrangements to develop and commercialize our unpartnered medicines. However, we may not be able to negotiate favorable collaborative arrangements for these drug programs. If we cannot continue to secure additional collaborative partners, our revenues could decrease and the development of our medicines could suffer.\nOur corporate partners are developing and/or funding many of the medicines in our development pipeline. If any of these pharmaceutical companies stops developing and/or funding these medicines, our business could suffer and we may not have, or be willing to dedicate, the resources available to develop these medicines on our own.\nOur collaborators can terminate their relationships with us under certain circumstances, many of which are outside of our control. For example, as part of a reprioritization of its pipeline and strategic review of its rare disease business, GSK declined its option on TEGSEDI and IONIS-FB-LRx.\nEven with funding from corporate partners, if our partners do not effectively perform their obligations under our agreements with them, it would delay or stop the progress of our drug development and commercial programs.\nIn addition to receiving funding, we enter into collaborative arrangements with third parties to:\n\u25cf\nconduct clinical studies;\n\u25cf\nseek and obtain marketing authorization; and\n\u25cf\nmanufacture, market and sell our medicines.\nOnce we have secured a collaborative arrangement to further develop and commercialize one of our drug development programs, such as our collaborations with AstraZeneca, Bayer, Biogen, GSK, Janssen, Novartis and Roche, these collaborations may not continue or result in commercialized medicines, or may not progress as quickly as we first anticipated.\nFor example, a collaborator such as AstraZeneca, Bayer, Biogen, GSK, Janssen, Novartis or Roche, could determine that it is in its financial interest to:\n\u25cf\npursue alternative technologies or develop alternative products that may be competitive with the drug that is part of the collaboration with us;\n\u25cf\npursue higher-priority programs or change the focus of its own development programs; or\n\u25cf\nchoose to devote fewer resources to our medicines than it does for its own medicines.\nIf any of these occur, it could affect our partner\u2019s commitment to the collaboration with us and could delay or otherwise negatively affect the commercialization of our medicines, including SPINRAZA.\nIf we do not progress in our programs as anticipated, the price of our securities could decrease.\nFor planning purposes, we estimate and may disclose the timing of a variety of clinical, regulatory and other milestones, such as when we anticipate a certain drug will enter the clinic, when we anticipate completing a clinical study, or when we anticipate filing an application for, or obtaining, marketing authorization. We base our estimates on present facts and a variety of assumptions. Many underlying assumptions are outside of our control. If we do not achieve milestones in accordance with our or our investors\u2019 expectations, including milestones related to SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA, the price of our securities could decrease.\nIf we cannot protect our patents or our other proprietary rights, others may compete more effectively against us.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon whether we can continue to develop and secure intellectual property rights to proprietary products and services. However, we may not receive issued patents on any of our pending patent applications in the U.S. or in other countries. In addition, the scope of any of our issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to provide us with a competitive advantage. Furthermore, other parties may successfully challenge, invalidate or circumvent our issued patents or patents licensed to us so that our patent rights do not create an effective competitive barrier or revenue source.\nIntellectual property litigation could be expensive and prevent us from pursuing our programs.\nFrom time to time we have to defend our intellectual property rights. If we are involved in an intellectual property dispute, we sometimes need to litigate to defend our rights or assert them against others. Disputes can involve arbitration, litigation or proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or the International Trade Commission or foreign patent authorities. Intellectual property litigation can be extremely expensive, and this expense, as well as the consequences should we not prevail, could seriously harm our business.\nIf a third party claims that our medicines or technology infringe its patents or other intellectual property rights, we may have to discontinue an important product or product line, alter our products and processes, pay license fees or cease certain activities. We may not be able to obtain a license to needed intellectual property on favorable terms, if at all. There are many patents issued or applied for in the biotechnology industry, and we may not be aware of patents or patent applications held by others that relate to our business. This is especially true since patent applications in the U.S. are filed confidentially for the first 18 months. Moreover, the validity and breadth of biotechnology patents involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal issues remain.\nIf we fail to obtain timely funding, we may need to curtail or abandon some of our programs.\nMany of our medicines are undergoing clinical studies or are in the early stages of research and development. Most of our drug programs will require significant additional research, development, preclinical and/or clinical testing, marketing authorization and/or commitment of significant additional resources prior to their successful commercialization. As of December 31, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments equal to $2.1 billion. If we do not meet our goals to successfully commercialize our medicines, including SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA, or to license our medicines and proprietary technologies, we will need additional funding in the future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, such as the following:\n\u25cf\nsuccessful commercialization for SPINRAZA and TEGSEDI;\n\u25cf\nmarketing approvals for WAYLIVRA;\n\u25cf\nthe profile and launch timing of our medicines, including TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA;\n\u25cf\nchanges in existing collaborative relationships and our ability to establish and maintain additional collaborative arrangements;\n\u25cf\ncontinued scientific progress in our research, drug discovery and development programs;\n\u25cf\nthe size of our programs and progress with preclinical and clinical studies;\n\u25cf\nthe time and costs involved in obtaining marketing authorizations; and\n\u25cf\ncompeting technological and market developments, including the introduction by others of new therapies that address our markets.\nIf we need additional funds, we may need to raise them through public or private financing. Additional financing may not be available at all or on acceptable terms. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, the shares of existing stockholders will be diluted and the price, as well as the price of our other securities, may decline. If adequate funds are not available or not available on acceptable terms, we may have to cut back on one or more of our research, drug discovery or development programs. Alternatively, we may obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others, which could require us to give up rights to certain of our technologies or medicines.\nIf our planned management transition is not successful our business could suffer.\nIn January 2020, Dr. Crooke, our founder and Chief Executive Officer, plans to transition from Chief Executive Officer to Executive Chairman of our Board of Directors. As Executive Chairman, Dr. Crooke will continue to be responsible for the activities of the board and will remain active in the company, providing strategic advice and continuing to participate in the scientific activities. Our board has selected Dr. Monia, who has been our Chief Operating Officer for the last year and a member of our team since our founding nearly 30 years ago, to serve as our Chief Executive Officer starting in January 2020. If this transition is not successful, our business could suffer.\nThe loss of key personnel, or the inability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel, could make it more difficult to run our business and reduce our likelihood of success.\nWe are dependent on the principal members of our management and scientific staff. We do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers that would prevent them from leaving us. The loss of our management and key scientific employees might slow the achievement of important research and development goals. It is also critical to our success that we recruit and retain qualified scientific personnel to perform research and development work. We may not be able to attract and retain skilled and experienced scientific personnel on acceptable terms because of intense competition for experienced scientists among many pharmaceutical and health care companies, universities and non-profit research institutions. In addition, failure to succeed in clinical studies may make it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified scientific personnel.\nIf the price of our securities continues to be highly volatile, this could make it harder for you to liquidate your investment and could increase your risk of suffering a loss.\nThe market price of our common stock, like that of the securities of many other biopharmaceutical companies, has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile. These fluctuations in our common stock price may significantly affect the trading price of our securities. During the 12 months preceding December 31, 2018, the market price of our common stock ranged from $59.81 to $39.07 per share. Many factors can affect the market price of our securities, including, for example, fluctuations in our operating results, announcements of collaborations, clinical study results, technological innovations or new products being developed by us or our competitors, governmental regulation, marketing authorization, changes in payors\u2019 reimbursement policies, developments in patent or other proprietary rights, public concern regarding the safety of our medicines and general market conditions.\nWe are exposed to potential product liability claims, and insurance against these claims may not be available to us at a reasonable rate in the future or at all.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing, marketing and sale of therapeutic products, including potential product liability claims related to SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA. We have clinical study insurance coverage and commercial product liability insurance coverage. However, this insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover claims against us, or be available to us at an acceptable cost, if at all. Regardless of their merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in decreased demand for our drug products, injury to our reputation, withdrawal of clinical study volunteers and loss of revenues. Thus, whether or not we are insured, a product liability claim or product recall may result in losses that could be material.\nBecause we use biological materials, hazardous materials, chemicals and radioactive compounds, if we do not comply with laws regulating the protection of the environment and health and human safety, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur research, development and manufacturing activities involve the use of potentially harmful biological materials as well as materials, chemicals and various radioactive compounds that could be hazardous to human health and safety or the environment. We store most of these materials and various wastes resulting from their use at our facilities in Carlsbad, California pending ultimate use and disposal. We cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination, which could cause:\n\u25cf\ninterruption of our research, development and manufacturing efforts;\n\u25cf\ninjury to our employees and others;\n\u25cf\nenvironmental damage resulting in costly clean up; and\n\u25cf\nliabilities under federal, state and local laws and regulations governing health and human safety, as well as the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and resultant waste products.\nIn such an event, we may be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. Although we carry insurance in amounts and types that we consider commercially reasonable, we do not have insurance coverage for losses relating to an interruption of our research, development or manufacturing efforts caused by contamination, and the coverage or coverage limits of our insurance policies may not be adequate. If our losses exceed our insurance coverage, our financial condition would be affected.\nIf a natural or man-made disaster strikes our research, development or manufacturing facilities or otherwise affects our business, it could delay our progress developing and commercializing our medicines.\nWe manufacture our research and clinical supplies in a manufacturing facility located in Carlsbad, California. We manufacture the finished drug product for TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA at third-party contract manufacturers. The facilities and the equipment we and our contract manufacturers use to research, develop and manufacture our medicines would be costly to replace and could require substantial lead time to repair or replace. Our facilities or our contract manufacturers may be harmed by natural or man-made disasters, including, without limitation, earthquakes, floods, fires and acts of terrorism; and if our facilities are affected by a disaster, our development and commercialization efforts would be delayed. Although we possess insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business from casualties, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, our development and commercialization activities could be harmed or delayed by a shutdown of the U.S. government, including the FDA.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation, other agreements and Delaware law may prevent stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides for classified terms for the members of our board of directors. Our certificate also includes a provision that requires at least 66 2/3 percent of our voting stockholders to approve a merger or certain other business transactions with, or proposed by, any holder of 15 percent or more of our voting stock, except in cases where certain directors approve the transaction or certain minimum price criteria and other procedural requirements are met.\nOur certificate of incorporation also requires that any action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders must be taken at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and may not be taken by written consent. In addition, only our board of directors, chairman of the board or chief executive officer can call special meetings of our stockholders. We have in the past, and may in the future, implement a stockholders\u2019 rights plan, also called a poison pill, which could make it uneconomical for a third party to acquire our company on a hostile basis. In addition, our board of directors has the authority to fix the rights and preferences of, and issue shares of preferred stock, which may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company without action by our stockholders.\nThe provisions of our convertible senior notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. Upon the occurrence of certain transactions constituting a fundamental change, holders of the notes will have the right, at their option, to require us to repurchase all of their notes or a portion of their notes, which may discourage certain types of transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over the then current market prices.\nThese provisions, as well as Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, and other of our agreements, may discourage certain types of transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices, and may limit the ability of our stockholders to approve transactions that they think may be in their best interests.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the trading price of our securities.\nFuture sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect trading prices of our securities. For example, we may issue approximately 10.3 million shares of our common stock upon conversion of our convertible senior notes. The addition of any of these shares into the public market may have an adverse effect on the price of our securities.\nOur business is subject to changing regulations for corporate governance and public disclosure that has increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance.\nEach year we are required to evaluate our internal controls systems in order to allow management to report on and our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm to attest to, our internal controls as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As a result, we continue to incur additional expenses and divert our management\u2019s time to comply with these regulations. In addition, if we cannot continue to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, we might be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or PCAOB, or The Nasdaq Global Select Market. Any such action could adversely affect our financial results and the market price of our common stock.\nThe SEC and other regulators have continued to adopt new rules and regulations and make additional changes to existing regulations that require our compliance. On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, was enacted. There are significant corporate governance and executive compensation-related provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act that require the SEC to adopt, or where the SEC has adopted, additional rules and regulations in these areas such as \u201csay on pay\u201d and proxy access. Stockholder activism, the current political environment and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact the manner in which we operate our business.\nChanges in tax laws, regulations and treaties could affect our future taxable income.\nA change in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation, of any country in which we operate could materially affect us. For example, the Tax Act represented a substantial change to tax laws in the U.S. However, it did not have a material impact on our financial statements because we maintained a valuation allowance on all of our net operating losses and other deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017. Over the next several years we expect to utilize our net operating losses and other deferred tax assets, and any future changes in tax laws could have a material effect on our business.\nWe could be subject to additional tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to U.S. federal, state, local and sales taxes in the U.S. and foreign income taxes, withholding taxes and transaction taxes in foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and our worldwide provision for taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many activities and transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In addition, our tax obligations and effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations, principles and interpretations, including those relating to income tax nexus, by recognizing tax losses or lower than anticipated earnings in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated earnings in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. We may be audited in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional taxes, sales taxes and value-added taxes against us. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of any tax audits or litigation could be materially different from our historical tax provisions and accruals, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period for which a determination is made.\nNegative conditions in the global credit markets and financial services and other industries may adversely affect our business.\nThe global credit markets, the financial services industry, the U.S. capital markets, and the U.S. economy as a whole have in the past experienced periods of substantial turmoil and uncertainty characterized by unprecedented intervention by the U.S. federal government and the failure, bankruptcy, or sale of various financial and other institutions. It is possible that a crisis in the global credit markets, the U.S. capital markets, the financial services industry or the U.S. economy may adversely affect our business, vendors and prospects, as well as our liquidity and financial condition. More specifically, our insurance carriers and insurance policies covering all aspects of our business may become financially unstable or may not be sufficient to cover any or all of our losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe are dependent on information technology systems, infrastructure and data, which exposes us to data security risks.\nWe are dependent upon our own or third-party information technology systems, infrastructure and data, including mobile technologies, to operate our business. The multitude and complexity of our computer systems may make them vulnerable to service interruption or destruction, disruption of data integrity, malicious intrusion, or random attacks. Likewise, data privacy or security incidents or breaches by employees or others may pose a risk that sensitive data, including our intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information of our employees, patients, customers or other business partners may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. Cyber-attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity. Cyber-attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware, denial-of-service, social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten data confidentiality, integrity and availability. Our business partners face similar risks and any security breach of their systems could adversely affect our security posture. A security breach or privacy violation that leads to disclosure or modification of or prevents access to patient information, including personally identifiable information or protected health information, could harm our reputation, compel us to comply with federal and/or state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents, subject us to mandatory corrective action, require us to verify the correctness of database contents and otherwise subject us to litigation or other liability under laws and regulations that protect personal data, any of which could disrupt our business and/or result in increased costs or loss of revenue. Moreover, the prevalent use of mobile devices that access confidential information increases the risk of data security breaches, which could lead to the loss of confidential information, trade secrets or other intellectual property. While we have invested, and continue to invest, in the protection of our data and information technology infrastructure, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent service interruptions, or identify breaches in our systems, that could adversely affect our business and operations and/or result in the loss of critical or sensitive information, which could result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm to us. In addition, our liability insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyber-attacks and other related breaches.", "PERMNO": 76661, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "IONS"}
