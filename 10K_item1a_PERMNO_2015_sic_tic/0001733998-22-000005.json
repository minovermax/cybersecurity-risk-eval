{"cik": "1733998", "company": "Northwest Natural Holding Co", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-25", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nNW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s business and financial results are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are not within our control, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us or that are not currently believed by us to be material may also harm our businesses, financial condition, and results of operations. When considering any investment in NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s securities, investors should carefully consider the following information, as well as information contained in the caption \"Forward-Looking Statements\", Item 7A, and our other documents filed with the SEC. This list is not exhaustive and the order of presentation does not reflect management\u2019s determination of priority or likelihood. Additionally, our listing of risk factors that primarily affects one of our businesses does not mean that such risk factor is inapplicable to our other businesses.\nLegal, Regulatory and Legislative Risks\nREGULATORY RISK. Regulation of NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s regulated businesses, including changes in the regulatory environment, failure of regulatory authorities to approve rates which provide for timely recovery of costs and an adequate return on invested capital, or an unfavorable outcome in regulatory proceedings may adversely impact NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe OPUC and WUTC have general regulatory authority over NW Natural\u2019s gas business in Oregon and Washington. NW Holdings\u2019 regulated water utility businesses are generally regulated by the public utility commission in the state in which a water business is located. These public utility commissions have broad regulatory authority, including: the rates charged to customers; authorized rates of return on rate base, including ROE; the amounts and types of securities that may be issued by our regulated utility companies, like NW Natural; services our regulated utility companies provide and the manner in which they provide them; the nature of investments our utility companies make; deferral and recovery of various expenses, including, but not limited to, pipeline replacement, environmental remediation costs, capital and information technology investments, commodity hedging expense, and certain employee benefit expenses such as pension costs; transactions with affiliated interests; regulatory adjustment mechanisms such as weather adjustment mechanisms, and other matters. The OPUC also regulates actions investors may take with respect to our utility companies, NW Natural and NW Holdings. Similarly, FERC has regulatory authority over NW Natural\u2019s interstate storage services. Expansion of our businesses could result in regulation by other regulatory authorities. For example, a subsidiary of NW Holdings has contracted to acquire a water and wastewater sector business in Arizona that is subject to the regulatory authority of the Arizona Corporation Commission.\nThe prices regulators allow us to charge for regulated utility service, and the maximum FERC-approved rates FERC authorizes us to charge for interstate storage and related transportation services, are the most significant factors affecting both NW Natural\u2019s and NW Holdings\u2019 financial position, results of operations and liquidity. State utility regulators have the authority to disallow recovery of costs they find imprudently incurred or otherwise disallowed, and rates that regulators allow may be insufficient for recovery of costs we incur. We expect to continue to make expenditures to expand, improve and safely operate our gas and water utility distribution and gas storage systems, and to decarbonize our gas systems. Regulators can deny recovery of those costs. Furthermore, while each applicable state regulator has established an authorized rate of return for our regulated utility businesses, we may not be able to achieve the earnings level authorized. Moreover, in the normal course of business we may place assets in service or incur higher than expected levels of operating expense before rate cases can be filed to recover those costs (this is commonly referred to as regulatory lag). The failure of any regulatory commission to approve requested rate increases on a timely basis to recover costs or to allow an adequate return could adversely impact NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nAs companies with regulated utility businesses, we frequently have dockets open with our regulators, including a general rate case filed with the OPUC in December 2021. The regulatory proceedings for these dockets typically involve multiple parties, including governmental agencies, consumer and other advocacy groups, and other third parties. Each party advocates for the interests that they represent, which may include lower rates, additional regulatory oversight over the company or advancing other interests. We cannot predict the timing or outcome of these proceedings or our pending Oregon general rate case, or the effects of those outcomes on NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nLEGISLATIVE, COMPLIANCE AND TAXING AUTHORITY RISK. NW Holdings and NW Natural are subject to governmental regulation, and compliance with local, state and federal requirements, including taxing requirements, and unforeseen changes in or interpretations of such requirements could affect NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nNW Holdings and NW Natural are subject to regulation by federal, state and local governmental authorities. We are required to comply with a variety of laws and regulations and to obtain authorizations, permits, approvals and certificates from governmental agencies in various aspects of our business. Significant changes in federal, state, or local governmental leadership can accelerate or amplify changes in existing laws or regulations, or the manner in which they are interpreted or enforced. For example, the 2020 United States Presidential election resulted in leadership changes in many federal administrative agencies. Moreover, the 2020 election resulted in Democratic control of the presidency and both houses of Congress, and as a result, the U.S. Congress and the U.S. presidential administration has made and is expected to continue to make changes to fiscal, tax, regulation, environmental, climate and other federal policies. For example, the United States has rejoined the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, a global framework to reduce GHG emissions and limit global warming, and the presidential administration\nhas issued executive orders aimed at reducing GHG emissions and has declared climate change a national security priority. Similarly, federal, state and local elections during 2022 may lead to significant policy changes that may affect us. In addition, foreign governments may implement changes to their policies, in response to changes to U.S. policy or otherwise. Although we cannot predict the impact, if any, of these changes to our businesses, they could adversely affect NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. Until we know what policy changes are made and how those changes impact our businesses and the business of our competitors over the long term, we will not know if, overall, we will benefit from them or will be negatively affected by them.\nWe cannot predict changes in laws, regulations, interpretations or enforcement or the impact of such changes. Additionally, any failure to comply with existing or new laws and regulations could result in fines, penalties or injunctive measures. For example, under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the FERC has civil authority under the Natural Gas Act to impose penalties for current violations of nearly $1.4 million per day for each violation. In addition, as the regulatory environment for our businesses increases in complexity, the risk of inadvertent noncompliance may also increase. Changes in regulations, the imposition of additional regulations, and the failure to comply with laws and regulations could negatively influence NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s operating environment and results of operations.\nAdditionally, changes in federal, state, local or foreign tax laws and their related regulations, or differing interpretations or enforcement of applicable law by a federal, state, local or foreign taxing authority, could result in substantial cost to us and negatively affect our results of operations. Tax law and its related regulations and case law are inherently complex and dynamic. Disputes over interpretations of tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority in examination, through programs like the Compliance Assurance Process (CAP), upon appeal or through litigation. Our judgments may include reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been or plan to be taken that may be subject to challenge by taxing authorities. Changes in laws, regulations or adverse judgments and the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions may negatively affect NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, certain tax assets and liabilities, such as deferred tax assets and regulatory tax assets and liabilities, are recognized or recorded by NW Holdings or NW Natural based on certain assumptions and determinations made based on available evidence, such as projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. If these assumptions and determinations prove to be incorrect, the recorded results may not be realized, which may negatively impact the financial results of NW Holdings and NW Natural.\nThere is uncertainty as to how our regulators will reflect the impact of the legislation and other government regulation in rates. The resulting ratemaking treatment may negatively affect NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nREPUTATIONAL RISKS. Customers', legislators', and regulators' opinions of NW Holdings and NW Natural are affected by many factors, including system and fuel reliability and safety, protection of customer information, rates, media coverage, and public sentiment. To the extent that customers, legislators, or regulators have or develop a negative opinion of our businesses, NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nA number of factors can affect customers\u2019, legislators\u2019 and regulators\u2019 perception of us or our business including: service interruptions or safety concerns due to failures of equipment or facilities or from other causes, and our ability to promptly respond to such failures; our ability to safeguard sensitive customer information; the timing and magnitude of rate increases; and volatility of rates. Customers', legislators', and regulators' opinions of us can also be affected by media coverage, including the proliferation of social media, which may include information, whether factual or not, that could damage the perception of natural gas, our brand, or our reputation.\nAlthough we believe that natural gas serves an important role in helping our region reduce GHG emissions and move to a low-carbon future, certain advocacy groups have opposed use of natural gas as a fuel source altogether and have pursued policies that place limitations or moratoriums or impose additional costs on the use of natural gas in a variety of contexts. Concerns raised about the use of natural gas include the potential for natural gas explosions or delivery disruptions, methane leakage along transportation and delivery systems and end-use equipment, and contribution of natural gas energy use to GHG emission levels and global warming. Concerns have also been raised regarding the use of RNG in place of natural gas. In addition, studies and claims by advocacy groups from time to time question the indoor public health effects of burning natural gas, which may also impact public perception. Shifts in public sentiment due to these concerns or others that may be raised may impact further legislative initiatives, litigation, as well as behaviors and perceptions of customers, investors and regulators.\nIf customers, legislators, or regulators have or develop a negative opinion of us and our services, or of natural gas as an energy source generally, this could make it more difficult for us to achieve legislative or regulatory outcomes supportive of our business. Negative opinions could also result in reduced customer growth, sales volumes reductions, increased use of other sources of energy, or difficulties in accessing capital markets. Any of these consequences could adversely affect NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nREGULATORY ACCOUNTING RISK. In the future, NW Holdings or NW Natural may no longer meet the criteria for continued application of regulatory accounting practices for all or a portion of our regulated operations.\nIf we can no longer apply regulatory accounting, we could be required to write off our regulatory assets and precluded from the future deferral of costs not recovered through rates at the time such amounts are incurred, even if we are expected to recover these amounts from customers in the future.\nCOVID-19 Risk\nPUBLIC HEALTH RISK. The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is widespread, severe and unpredictable. The continuation of this outbreak and the resulting economic conditions, or the emergence of other epidemic or pandemic crises, could materially and adversely affect NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nThe novel coronavirus (COVID-19), which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, has resulted in widespread and severe global, national and local economic and societal disruptions. In late March 2020, the Governors of Oregon and Washington issued \u201cstay at home\u201d executive orders requiring the closure of \u201cnon-essential\u201d business and modifications to certain \u201cessential\u201d businesses. While the states that we operate in have reopened with many businesses beginning to return to normal operating practices, the timing for recovery of businesses and local economies remains difficult to predict and dependent on the future impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, resurgences or mutations of the virus, including the Delta and Omicron variants, any potential future shutdowns, efficacy and acceptance of vaccines, or any requirements related to vaccines or testing. Additionally, while we have undertaken emergency response command structures and protocols that have operated well, they may not be sufficient to adequately mitigate the effects of COVID-19 on our operations, particularly in the event the pandemic worsens. The situation is rapidly evolving and dynamic and could ultimately adversely affect our business by, among other things:\n\u2022disrupting our access to capital markets or increasing costs of capital affecting our liquidity in the future;\n\u2022reducing demand for natural gas, particularly from commercial and industrial customers that may be considered \u201cnon-essential\u201d businesses under current or future governmental action, or that are suffering slow-downs or ultimately close completely due to pandemic effects;\n\u2022reducing customer growth and new meter additions due to less economic, construction or conversion activity;\n\u2022subjecting us to legislative or prolonged administrative action that limits our ability to collect on overdue accounts or disconnect gas service for nonpayment, beyond an amount or period of time acceptable to us;\n\u2022increasing our operating costs for emergency supplies, personal protective equipment, cleaning services and supplies, remote technology and other specific needs;\n\u2022impacting our capital expenditures if construction activities are suspended or delayed;\n\u2022sickening or causing a mandatory quarantine of a large percentage of our workforce, or key workgroups with specialized skill sets, impairing our ability to perform key business functions or execute our business continuity plans;\n\u2022impacting our or our suppliers\u2019 ability to recruit and retain qualified personnel as a result of vaccine mandates or other pandemic regulations or protocols impacting employees;\n\u2022adversely affecting the asset values of NW Natural\u2019s defined benefit pension plan or causing a failure to maintain sustained growth in pension investments over time, increasing our contribution requirements;\n\u2022limiting or curtailing entirely, public utility commissions\u2019 ability to approve or authorize applications or other requests we may make with respect to our regulated businesses;\n\u2022increasing volatility in the price of natural gas;\n\u2022impairing the functioning of our supply chain or ability to rely on third parties or business partners; and\n\u2022creating additional cybersecurity vulnerabilities due to heavy reliance on remote working in our business continuity model.\nAdditionally, the effects of COVID-19 or other pandemics could create prolonged unfavorable economic conditions, slowed economic growth, inflation, which is currently on the rise, or an economic recession that may result in or be accompanied by unprecedented unemployment rates and declines in the value of certain assets, adversely affecting the income and financial resources of many domestic households and businesses. It is unclear whether governmental responses to these conditions will lessen the severity or duration of any economic effects. Our operational and financial results would likely be affected by such economic conditions. Less new housing construction, fewer conversions to natural gas, higher levels of residential foreclosures and vacancies, and personal and business bankruptcies or reduced spending could all negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe ultimate impact of COVID-19 on our business cannot be predicted and will depend on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of the pandemic and resulting economic effects, actions taken to contain the pandemic and mitigate its effects, and the extent to which normal economic and operating conditions can continue. Any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our business, outlook, financial condition, and results of operations and cash flows, which could be significant.\nGrowth and Strategic Risks\nSTRATEGIC TRANSACTION RISK. NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s ability to successfully complete strategic transactions, including merger, acquisition, divestiture, joint venture, business development projects or other strategic transactions is subject to significant risks, including the risk that required regulatory or governmental approvals may not be obtained, risks relating to unknown problems or liabilities or problems or liabilities undisclosed to us, and the risk that for these or other reasons, we may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we anticipate from such transactions, which could adversely affect NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nFrom time to time, NW Holdings and NW Natural have pursued and may continue to pursue strategic transactions including mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, business development projects or other strategic transactions, including, but not limited to, investments in RNG projects on a regulated basis by NW Natural and on a non-regulated basis by NW Holdings, as well as acquisitions by NW Holdings in the water and wastewater sectors. Any such transactions involve substantial risks, including the following:\n\u2022purchase or sale transactions that are contracted for may fail to close for a variety of reasons;\n\u2022acquired businesses or assets may not produce revenues, earnings or cash flow at anticipated levels, which could, among other things, result in the impairment of any investments or goodwill associated with such acquisitions;\n\u2022acquired businesses or assets could have environmental, permitting, or other problems for which contractual protections prove inadequate;\n\u2022there may be difficulties in integration or operation costs of new businesses;\n\u2022there may exist liabilities that were not disclosed to us, that exceed our estimates, or for which our rights to indemnification from the seller are limited;\n\u2022we may be unable to obtain the necessary regulatory or governmental approvals to close a transaction, receive approvals granted subject to terms that are unacceptable to us;\n\u2022we may be unable to achieve the anticipated regulatory treatment of any such transaction as part of the transaction approval or subsequent to closing the transaction; or\n\u2022we may be unable to avoid a sale of assets for a price that is less than the book value of those assets.\nOne or more of these risks could affect NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nBUSINESS DEVELOPMENT RISK. NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s business development projects may not be successful or may encounter unanticipated obstacles, costs, changes or delays that could result in a project becoming impaired, which could negatively impact NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nBusiness development projects involve many risks. We are currently engaged in several business development projects, including, but not limited to, several water, wastewater and RNG projects. We may also engage in other business development projects such as investments in additional long-term gas reserves, non-regulated investments in RNG projects, and purchasing, marketing and reselling of RNG and its associated attributes, CNG refueling stations, power to gas or hydrogen projects or other similar projects. Our business development activities are subject to uncertainties and changed circumstances and may not reach the scale expected, be successful or perform as anticipated. Additionally, we may not be able to obtain required governmental permits and approvals to complete our projects in a cost-efficient or timely manner, potentially resulting in delays or abandonment of the projects. We could also experience issues such as: technological challenges; ineffective scalability; unsuccessful business models; startup and construction delays; construction cost overruns; disputes with contractors; the inability to negotiate acceptable agreements such as rights-of-way, easements, construction, gas supply or other material contracts; changes in customer demand, perception or commitment; public opposition to projects; marketing risk and changes in market regulation, behavior or prices (including markets for RNG and its associated attributes); the inability to receive expected tax or regulatory treatment; and operating cost increases. Additionally, we may be unable to finance our business development projects at acceptable costs or within a scheduled time frame necessary for completing the project. Any of the foregoing risks, if realized, could result in business development efforts failing to produce expected financial results and the project investment becoming impaired, and such impairment could have an adverse effect on NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nJOINT PARTNER RISK. Investing in business development projects through partnerships, joint ventures or other business arrangements affects our ability to manage certain risks and could adversely impact NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe use joint ventures and other business arrangements to manage and diversify the risks of certain development projects, including NW Natural\u2019s gas reserves agreements and certain RNG projects. NW Holdings or NW Natural currently has and may further acquire or develop part-ownership interests in other projects in the future, including but not limited to, natural gas, water, wastewater, RNG, or hydrogen projects. Under these arrangements, we may not be able to fully direct the management and policies of the business relationships, and other participants in those relationships may act contrary to our interests, including making operational decisions that could negatively affect our costs and liabilities. In addition, other participants may withdraw from the project, divest important assets, become financially distressed or bankrupt, or have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours.\nNW Natural\u2019s gas reserves arrangements, which operate as a hedge backed by physical gas supplies, involve a number of risks, including: gas production that is significantly less than the expected volumes, or no gas volumes; operating costs that are higher than expected; inherent risks of gas production, including disruption to operations or a complete shut-in of the field; and one or more participants in one of these gas reserves arrangements becoming financially insolvent or acting contrary to NW Natural\u2019s interests. For example, Jonah Energy, the counterparty in NW Natural\u2019s gas reserves arrangement, is no longer rated by credit agencies. While NW Natural intends to continue monitoring Jonah Energy\u2019s financial condition and take appropriate actions to preserve NW Natural\u2019s interests, it does not control Jonah Energy\u2019s financial condition or continued performance under the gas reserves arrangement. The cost of the original gas reserves venture is currently included in customer rates and additional wells\nunder that arrangement are recovered at specific costs, the occurrence of one or more of these risks could affect NW Natural\u2019s ability to recover this hedge in rates. Further, new gas reserves arrangements have not been approved for inclusion in rates, and regulators may ultimately determine to not include all or a portion of future transactions in rates. The realization of any of these situations could adversely impact NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCUSTOMER GROWTH RISK. NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s NGD margin, earnings and cash flow may be negatively affected if we are unable to sustain customer growth rates in our NGD segment.\nNW Natural\u2019s NGD margins and earnings growth have largely depended upon the sustained growth of its residential and commercial customer base due, in part, to the new construction housing market, conversions of customers to natural gas from other energy sources and growing commercial use of natural gas. Insufficient growth in these markets, for economic, political, public perception, or other reasons could adversely affect NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s utility margin, earnings and cash flows.\nRISK OF COMPETITION. Our NGD business is subject to increased competition which could negatively affect NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s results of operations.\nIn the residential and commercial markets, NW Natural\u2019s NGD business competes primarily with suppliers of electricity, fuel oil, and propane. In the industrial market, NW Natural competes with suppliers of all forms of energy. Competition among these forms of energy is based on price, efficiency, reliability, performance, market conditions, technology, federal, state and local governmental regulation, environmental impacts, and public perception. Technological improvements such as heat pumps, batteries or other alternative technologies could erode NW Natural\u2019s competitive advantage. If natural gas prices rise relative to other energy sources, or if the cost, environmental impact or public perception of such other energy sources improves relative to natural gas, it may negatively affect NW Natural\u2019s ability to attract new customers or retain our existing residential, commercial and industrial customers, which could have a negative impact on our customer growth rate and NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s results of operations.\nOur natural gas storage operations compete primarily with other storage facilities and pipelines. Increased competition in the natural gas storage business could reduce the demand for our natural gas storage services, drive prices down for our storage business, and adversely affect our ability to renew or replace existing contracts at rates sufficient to maintain current revenues and cash flows, which could adversely affect NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOperational Risks\nOPERATING RISK. Transporting and storing natural gas and distributing natural gas and water involves numerous risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs, some or all of which may not be fully covered by insurance, and which could adversely affect NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nNW Holdings and NW Natural are subject to all of the risks and hazards inherent in the businesses of gas distribution and storage, water distribution, and wastewater services including:\n\u2022earthquakes, wildfires, floods, storms, landslides and other severe weather incidents and natural hazards;\n\u2022leaks or losses of natural gas, water or wastewater, or contamination of natural gas or water by chemicals or compounds, as a result of the malfunction of equipment or facilities or otherwise;\n\u2022damages from third parties;\n\u2022operator errors;\n\u2022negative performance by our storage reservoirs, facilities, or wells that could cause us to fail to meet expected or forecasted operational levels or contractual commitments to our customers;\n\u2022problems maintaining, or the malfunction of, pipelines, wellbores and related equipment and facilities that form a part of the infrastructure that is critical to the operation of our gas and water distribution, wastewater services and gas storage facilities;\n\u2022presence of chemicals or other compounds in natural gas that could adversely affect the performance of the system or end-use equipment;\n\u2022collapse of underground storage reservoirs;\n\u2022inadequate supplies of natural gas or water or contamination of water supplies;\n\u2022operating costs that are substantially higher than expected;\n\u2022migration of natural gas through faults in the rock or to some area of the reservoir where existing wells cannot drain the gas effectively, resulting in loss of the gas;\n\u2022blowouts (uncontrolled escapes of gas from a pipeline or well) or other accidents, fires and explosions; and\n\u2022risks and hazards inherent in the drilling operations associated with the development of gas storage facilities, and wells.\nFor example, TC Pipelines, LP (TC Pipelines) has identified the presence of a chemical substance, dithiazine, at several facilities on the system of its subsidiary, Gas Transmission Northwest (GTN), and those of some upstream and downstream connecting pipeline facilities. A portion of NW Natural\u2019s gas supplies from Canada are transported on GTN\u2019s pipelines. TC Pipelines reports that dithiazine can drop out of gas streams in a powdery form at some points of pressure reduction (for example, at a regulator), and that in incidents where a sufficient quantity of the material accumulates in certain places, improper functioning of equipment can occur, which can result in increased preventative and corrective action costs. While NW Natural has not detected significant\nquantities of dithiazine on its system to date, we continue to monitor and could discover increased levels of dithiazine or other compounds on NW Natural\u2019s system that could affect the performance of the system or end-use equipment.\nThese risks could result in disruption of service, personal injury or loss of human life, damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution or other environmental damage, breaches of our contractual commitments, and may result in curtailment or suspension of operations, which in turn could lead to significant costs and lost revenues. Further, because our pipeline, storage and distribution facilities are in or near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers, and industrial sites, any loss of human life or adverse financial outcomes resulting from such events could be significant. We could be subject to lawsuits, claims, and criminal and civil enforcement actions. Additionally, we may not be able to maintain the level or types of insurance we desire, and the insurance coverage we do obtain may contain large deductibles or fail to cover certain hazards or cover all potential losses. The occurrence of any operating risks not covered by insurance could adversely affect NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSAFETY REGULATION RISK. NW Holdings and NW Natural may experience increased federal, state and local regulation of the safety of our systems and operations, which could adversely affect NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s operating costs and financial results.\nThe safety and protection of the public, our customers and our employees is and will remain our top priority. We are committed to consistently monitoring and maintaining our distribution systems and storage operations to ensure that natural gas and water is acquired, stored and delivered safely, reliably and efficiently. Given recent high-profile natural gas explosions, leaks and accidents in other parts of the country involving both distribution systems and storage facilities, we anticipate that the natural gas industry may be the subject of even greater federal, state and local regulatory oversight. For example, in 2020, the Protecting our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act (PIPES Act) reauthorization was signed into law expanding regulations for natural gas transmission and distribution pipelines. Among other things, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) is implementing the requirements of the PIPES Act, including regulations related to the detection and repair of leaks and valve automation.\nIn addition, our workplaces are subject to the requirements of the Department of Transportation, through the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, as well as state and local statutes and regulations that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. The failure to comply with these requirements or general industry standards, including keeping adequate records or preventing occupational injuries or exposure, could expose us to civil or criminal liability, enforcement actions, and regulatory fines and penalties that may not be recoverable through our rates and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe intend to work diligently with industry associations and federal and state regulators to seek to ensure compliance with these regulations and other new laws. We expect there to be increased costs associated with compliance, and those costs could be significant. If these costs are not recoverable in our customer rates, they could have a negative impact on NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s operating costs and financial results.\nRELIANCE ON THIRD PARTIES TO SUPPLY NATURAL GAS RISK. NW Natural relies on third parties to supply the natural gas in its NGD segment, and limitations on NW Natural\u2019s ability to obtain supplies, or failure to receive expected supplies for which it has contracted, could have an adverse impact on NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial results.\nNW Natural\u2019s ability to secure natural gas for current and future sales depends upon its ability to purchase and receive delivery of supplies of natural gas from third parties. NW Natural, and in some cases, its suppliers of natural gas, does not have control over the availability of natural gas supplies, competition for those supplies, disruptions in those supplies, priority allocations on transmission pipelines, or pricing of those supplies. Additionally, third parties on whom NW Natural relies may fail to deliver gas for which it has contracted. For example, in October, 2018, a 36-inch pipeline near Prince George, British Columbia owned by Enbridge ruptured, disrupting natural gas flows from Canada into Washington while the ruptured pipeline and an adjacent pipeline were assessed and the ruptured pipeline was repaired. Once repaired, pressurization levels for those pipelines were reduced for a significant period of time for assessment and testing. Similarly, in December 2020, gas supply to approximately 5,500 of NW Natural\u2019s customers was disrupted for a few days as a result of a vehicle crashing into a Williams Northwest Pipeline facility. If NW Natural is unable or limited in its ability to obtain natural gas from its current suppliers or new sources, it may not be able to meet customers' gas requirements and would likely incur costs associated with actions necessary to mitigate service disruptions, both of which could significantly and negatively impact NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s results of operations.\nSINGLE TRANSPORTATION PIPELINE RISK. NW Natural relies on a single pipeline company for the transportation of gas to its service territory, a disruption of which could adversely impact its ability to meet customers\u2019 gas requirements, which could significantly and negatively impact NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s results of operations.\nNW Natural\u2019s distribution system is directly connected to a single interstate pipeline, which is owned and operated by Northwest Pipeline. The pipeline\u2019s gas flows are bi-directional, transporting gas into the Portland metropolitan market from two directions: (1) the north, which brings supplies from the British Columbia and Alberta supply basins; and (2) the east, which brings supplies from the Alberta and the U.S. Rocky Mountain supply basins. If there is a rupture or inadequate capacity in, or supplies to maintain adequate pressures in, the pipeline, NW Natural may not be able to meet its customers\u2019 gas requirements and we\nwould likely incur costs associated with actions necessary to mitigate service disruptions, both of which could significantly and negatively impact NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s results of operations.\nTHIRD PARTY PIPELINE RISK. NW Natural\u2019s gas storage business depends on third-party pipelines that connect our storage facilities to interstate pipelines, the failure or unavailability of which could adversely affect NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur gas storage facilities are reliant on the continued operation of a third-party pipeline and other facilities that provide delivery options to and from our storage facilities. Because we do not own all of these pipelines, their operations are not within our control. If the third-party pipeline to which we are connected were to become unavailable for current or future withdrawals or injections of natural gas due to repairs, damage to the infrastructure, lack of capacity or other reasons, our ability to operate efficiently and satisfy our customers\u2019 needs could be compromised, thereby potentially having an adverse impact on NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWORKFORCE RISK. NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s businesses are heavily dependent on being able to attract and retain qualified employees and maintain a competitive cost structure with market-based salaries and employee benefits, and workforce disruptions could adversely affect NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s operations and results.\nNW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s ability to implement our business strategy and serve our customers is dependent upon our continuing ability to attract and retain diverse, talented professionals and a technically skilled workforce, and being able to transfer the knowledge and expertise of our workforce to new and increasingly diverse employees as our largely older workforce retires. A significant portion of our workforce is currently eligible or will reach retirement eligibility within the next five years, which will require that we attract, train and retain skilled workers to prevent loss of institutional knowledge or skills gaps. We face competition for qualified personnel with specific skillsets. This competition is elevated by the record low unemployment in Oregon and may result in increased pressure on wages or other challenges in recruiting or retaining personnel. Without an appropriately skilled workforce, our ability to provide quality service and meet our regulatory requirements will be challenged and this could negatively impact NW Holdings' and NW Natural\u2019s earnings. Additionally, just over half of NW Natural workers are represented by the OPEIU Local No. 11 AFL-CIO, and are covered by a collective bargaining agreement that extends to May 31, 2024. Disputes with the union representing NW Natural employees over terms and conditions of their agreement, or failure to timely and effectively renegotiate the agreement upon its expiration, could result in instability in our labor relationship or other labor disruptions that could impact the timely delivery of gas and other services from our utility and storage facilities, which could strain relationships with customers and state regulators and cause a loss of revenues. The collective bargaining agreements may also limit our flexibility in dealing with NW Natural\u2019s workforce, and the ability to change work rules and practices and implement other efficiency-related improvements to successfully compete in today\u2019s challenging marketplace, which may negatively affect NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nEnvironmental Risks\nENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITY RISK. Certain of NW Natural\u2019s, and possibly NW Holdings\u2019, properties and facilities may pose environmental risks requiring remediation, the costs of which are difficult to estimate and which could adversely affect NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nNW Natural owns, or previously owned, properties that require environmental remediation or other action. NW Holdings or NW Natural may now, or in the future, own other properties that require environmental remediation or other action. NW Natural and NW Holdings accrue all material loss contingencies relating to these properties. A regulatory asset at NW Natural has been recorded for estimated costs pursuant to a deferral order from the OPUC and WUTC. In addition to maintaining regulatory deferrals, NW Natural settled with most of its historical liability insurers for only a portion of the costs it has incurred to date and expects to incur in the future. To the extent amounts NW Natural recovered from insurance are inadequate and it is unable to recover these deferred costs in utility customer rates, NW Natural would be required to reduce its regulatory assets which would result in a charge to earnings in the year in which regulatory assets are reduced. In addition, in Oregon, the OPUC approved the SRRM, which limits recovery of deferred amounts to those amounts which satisfy an annual prudence review and an earnings test that requires NW Natural to contribute additional amounts toward environmental remediation costs above approximately $10 million in years in which NW Natural earns above its authorized ROE. To the extent NW Natural earns more than its authorized ROE in a year, it would be required to cover environmental expenses greater than the $10 million with those earnings that exceed its authorized ROE. The OPUC ordered a review of the SRRM in 2018 or when we obtain greater certainty of environmental costs, whichever occurred first. We submitted information for review in 2018, and believe we could be subject to further review. Similarly, in October 2019, the WUTC authorized an ECRM, which allows for recovery of certain past deferred and future prudently incurred remediation costs allocable to Washington through application of insurance proceeds and collections from customers, subject to an annual prudence determination. These ongoing prudence reviews, or with respect to the SRRM, the earnings test, or the periodic review could reduce the amounts NW Natural is allowed to recover, and could adversely affect NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMoreover, we may have disputes with regulators and other parties as to the severity of particular environmental matters, what remediation efforts are appropriate, whether natural resources were damaged, and the portion of the costs or claims NW Natural or NW Holdings should bear. We cannot predict with certainty the amount or timing of future expenditures related to\nenvironmental investigations, remediation or other action, the portions of these costs allocable to NW Natural or NW Holdings, or disputes or litigation arising in relation thereto.\nEnvironmental liability estimates are based on current remediation technology, industry experience gained at similar sites, an assessment of probable level of responsibility, and the financial condition of other potentially responsible parties. However, it is difficult to estimate such costs due to uncertainties surrounding the course of environmental remediation, the preliminary nature of certain site investigations, natural recovery of the site, unavoidable limitations associated with environmental investigations and remedial technologies, evolving science, and the application of environmental laws that impose joint and several liabilities on all potentially responsible parties. These uncertainties and disputes arising therefrom could lead to further adversarial administrative proceedings or litigation, with associated costs and uncertain outcomes, all of which could adversely affect NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION COMPLIANCE RISK. NW Holdings and NW Natural are subject to environmental regulations for our ongoing businesses, compliance with which could adversely affect our operations or financial results.\nNW Holdings and NW Natural are subject to laws, regulations and other legal requirements enacted or adopted by federal, state and local governmental authorities relating to protection of the environment, including those legal requirements that govern discharges of substances into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and waste, groundwater quality and availability, plant and wildlife protection, and other aspects of environmental regulation. For example, our natural gas operations are subject to reporting requirements to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (ODEQ) regarding greenhouse gas emissions. These and other current and future additional environmental regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, which may or may not be recoverable in customer rates or through insurance. If these costs are not recoverable, or if these regulations reduce the desirability or cost-competitiveness of natural gas, they could have an adverse effect on NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s operations or financial condition. Furthermore, failure to comply with such laws or regulations could subject us to possible enforcement actions, financial liability or litigation, any of which could adversely affect NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nGLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE RISK. Our businesses may be subject to physical risks associated with climate change, all of which could adversely affect NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nClimate change may cause physical risks, including an increase in sea level, intensified storms, water scarcity, wildfire susceptibility and intensity and changes in weather conditions, such as changes in precipitation, average temperatures and extreme wind or other extreme weather events or climate conditions. Moreover, a significant portion of the nation\u2019s gas infrastructure is located in areas susceptible to storm damage that could be aggravated by wetland and barrier island erosion, which could give rise to gas supply interruptions and price spikes.\nThese and other physical changes could result in disruptions to natural gas production and transportation systems potentially increasing the cost of gas and affecting our natural gas businesses\u2019 ability to procure or transport gas to meet customer demand. These changes could also affect our distribution systems resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs, disruption of service, regulatory actions and lower customer satisfaction. Similar disruptions could occur in NW Holdings\u2019 water utility businesses. Additionally, to the extent that climate change adversely impacts the economic health or weather conditions of our service territory directly, it could adversely impact customer demand or our customers' ability to pay. Such physical risks could have an adverse effect on NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nPUBLIC PERCEPTION AND POLICY RISK. Changes in public sentiment or public policy with respect to natural gas, including through local, state or federal laws or legislation or other regulation (including ballot initiatives, executive orders or regulatory codes) or litigation, could adversely affect NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThere are a number of international, federal, state, and local legislative, legal, regulatory and other initiatives being proposed and adopted in an attempt to measure, control or limit the effects of global warming and climate change, including greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions such as carbon dioxide and methane. Legislation or other forms of public policy or regulation that aim to reduce GHG emissions at the federal, state, or local level could take a variety of forms including, but not limited to, GHG emissions limits, reporting requirements, carbon taxes, requirements to purchase carbon credits, building codes, increased efficiency standards, additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities or other regulatory actions, and incentives or mandates to conserve energy, or use renewable energy sources. Federal, state, or local governments may provide tax advantages and other subsidies to support alternative energy sources, withdraw funding from fossil fuel sources, mandate the use of specific fuels or technologies, or promote research into new technologies to reduce the cost and increase the scalability of alternative energy sources. For example, the State of Washington has enacted the Climate Commitment Act (CCA), which establishes a comprehensive program that provides an overall limit for GHG emissions from major sources in the state that begins on January 1, 2023 and declines yearly to 95% below 1990 levels by 2050. Similarly, in Oregon, largely as a result of the inability of the Oregon legislature to pass GHG legislation, in March 2020, the Oregon Governor issued an executive order establishing GHG emissions reduction goals and directing state agencies and commissions (including the ODEQ and the OPUC) to facilitate such GHG emission goals. In December 2021, the ODEQ concluded its process and issued final cap and reduce rules for the Climate Protection Program (CPP), which became effective January 1, 2022. The CPP outlines GHG emissions\nreduction goals of 50% by 2035 and 90% by 2050 from a 1990 baseline. NW Natural is subject to both the CCA and CPP. We expect that there will be additional efforts to address climate change in the 2022 legislative sessions in both Oregon and Washington.\nAdditionally, the Washington State Building Code Council adopted a statewide residential building code in February 2021 that requires new residential construction to achieve higher levels of energy efficiency based on specified carbon emissions assumptions, which calculate on-site electric appliances to have lower GHG emissions than comparable gas appliances. The same agency is considering changes to its commercial building code that could restrict or eliminate the use of gas space and water heating in new commercial construction beginning in July 2023.\nA number of local and county jurisdictions are also proposing or passing renewable energy resolutions or other measures in an effort to accelerate renewable energy goals. A number of cities across the country, and several in our service territory are currently considering actions aimed at formalizing climate action goals and driving down GHG emissions.\nSuch current or future legislation, regulation or other initiatives (including ballot initiatives or ordinances) could impose on our natural gas businesses operational requirements or restrictions, additional charges to fund energy efficiency initiatives, or levy a tax based on carbon content. In addition, while no such bans currently exist in NW Natural\u2019s operating territories, certain jurisdictions, including San Francisco, Seattle, and New York have enacted measures to ban or discourage the use of new natural gas hookups in residential or other buildings. Other jurisdictions, including several in our service territory, have considered similar restrictions or other measures discouraging the use of natural gas, such as requiring the conversion of buildings to electric heat, or adopting policies or incentives to encourage the use of electricity in lieu of natural gas. Such restrictions could adversely impact customer growth or usage and could adversely impact our ability to recover costs and maintain reasonable customer rates. In addition, certain cities, local jurisdictions and private parties have initiated lawsuits against companies related to climate change impacts, GHG emissions or climate-related disclosures. While NW Natural has not been subject to such litigation to date, such climate-related claims or actions could be costly to defend and could negatively impact our business, reputation, financial condition, and results of operations.\nNW Natural believes natural gas has an important role in moving the Pacific Northwest to a low carbon future, and to that end is developing programs and measures to reduce carbon emissions. However, NW Natural\u2019s efforts may not happen quickly enough to keep pace with legislation or other regulation, legal changes or public sentiment, or may not be as effective as expected.\nAny of these initiatives, or our unsuccessful response to them, could result in us incurring additional costs to comply with the imposed restrictions or programs, provide a cost or other competitive advantage to energy sources other than natural gas, reduce demand for natural gas, restrict our ability to add new meters, impose costs or restrictions on end users of natural gas, impact the prices we charge our customers, increase the likelihood of litigation, impose increased costs on us associated with the adoption of new infrastructure and technology to respond to such requirements which may or may not be recoverable in customer rates, and could negatively impact public perception of our services or products that negatively diminishes the value of our brand, all of which could adversely affect NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s business operations, financial condition and results of operations.\nBusiness Continuity and Technology Risks\nBUSINESS CONTINUITY RISK. NW Holdings and NW Natural may be adversely impacted by local or national disasters, political unrest, terrorist activities, cyber-attacks or data breaches, and other extreme events to which we may not be able to promptly respond, which could adversely affect NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s operations or financial condition.\nLocal or national disasters, political unrest, terrorist activities, cyber-attacks and data breaches, and other extreme events are a threat to our assets and operations. Companies in critical infrastructure industries may face a heightened risk due to being the target of, and having heightened exposure to, acts of terrorism or sabotage, including physical and security breaches of our physical infrastructure and information technology systems in the form of cyber-attacks or other forms of attacks. These attacks could, among other things, target or impact our technology or mechanical systems that operate our distribution, transmission or storage facilities and result in a disruption in our operations, damage to our system and inability to meet customer requirements. In addition, the threat of terrorist activities could lead to increased economic instability and volatility in the price of natural gas or other necessary commodities that could affect our operations. Threatened or actual national disasters or terrorist activities may also disrupt capital or bank markets and our ability to raise capital or obtain debt financing, or impact our suppliers or our customers directly. Local disaster or civil unrest could result in disruption of our infrastructure or part of our workforce being unable to operate or maintain our infrastructure or perform other tasks necessary to conduct our business. A slow or inadequate response to events may have an adverse impact on our operations and earnings. We may not be able to maintain sufficient insurance to cover all risks associated with local and national disasters, terrorist activities, cyber-attacks and other attacks or events. Additionally, large scale natural disasters or terrorist attacks could destabilize the insurance industry making the insurance we do have unavailable, which could increase the risk that an event could adversely affect NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s operations or financial results.\nRELIANCE ON TECHNOLOGY RISK. NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s efforts to integrate, consolidate and streamline each of their operations has resulted in increased reliance on technology, the failure of which could adversely affect NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nNW Holdings and NW Natural have undertaken a variety of initiatives to integrate, standardize, centralize and streamline operations. These efforts have resulted in greater reliance on technological tools such as, at NW Natural: an enterprise resource planning system, a digital dispatch system, an automated meter reading system, a web-based ordering and tracking system, and other similar technological tools and initiatives. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and adapt to technological changes in a cost-effective manner and to offer, on a timely basis, services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards. New technologies may emerge that could be superior to, or may not be compatible with, some of our existing technologies, and may require us to make significant expenditures to remain competitive. We continue to implement technology to improve our business processes and customer interactions. In addition, our various existing information technology systems require periodic modifications, upgrades and/or replacement. For example, NW Natural is working to upgrade its SAP system and intends to replace its customer information system in the near future.\nThere are various risks associated with these systems in addition to upgrades and replacements, including hardware and software failure, communications failure, data distortion or destruction, unauthorized access to data, misuse of proprietary or confidential data, unauthorized control through electronic means, programming mistakes and other inadvertent errors or deliberate human acts. In addition, we are dependent on a continuing flow of important components to maintain and upgrade our information technology systems. Our suppliers may face production or import delays due to natural disasters, strikes, lock-outs, political unrest, pandemics (including COVID-19) or other such circumstances. Technology services provided by third-parties also could be disrupted due to events and circumstances beyond our control which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny modifications, upgrades, system maintenance or replacements subject us to inherent costs and risks, including potential disruption of our internal control structure, substantial capital expenditures, additional administrative and operating expenses, retention of sufficiently skilled personnel to implement and operate the new systems, and other risks and costs of delays or difficulties in transitioning to new systems or of integrating new systems into our current systems. In addition, the difficulties with implementing new technology systems may cause disruptions in our business operations and have an adverse effect on our business and operations, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated. There is also risk that we may not be able to recover all costs associated with projects to improve our technological capabilities, which may adversely affect NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nCYBERSECURITY RISK. NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s status as an infrastructure services provider coupled with its reliance on technology could result in a security breach which could adversely affect NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough we take precautions to protect our technology systems and are not aware of any material security breaches to date, there is no guarantee that the procedures we have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to secured data and systems, including our industrial controls and other information technology systems, are adequate to safeguard against all security breaches or other cyberattacks. Additionally, the facilities and systems of clients, suppliers and third party service providers could be vulnerable to the same cyber risks as our facilities and systems, and such third party systems may be interconnected to our systems both physically and technologically. Therefore, an event caused by cyberattacks or other malicious act at an interconnected third party could impact our business and facilities similarly. As these potential cyber security attacks become more common and sophisticated, we could be required to incur costs to strengthen our systems or obtain specific insurance coverage against potential losses. Moreover, a variety of regulatory agencies are increasingly focused on cybersecurity risks, and specifically in critical infrastructure sectors. For example, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has published two security directives mandating cybersecurity actions for critical pipeline owners and operators.\nFailure to timely and effectively meet the requirements of these directives or other cybersecurity regulations could result in fines or other penalties. While we are unable to estimate a range of possible costs at this time, we could also incur significant costs in complying with regulatory directives, and there is no assurance that we will be able to recover those costs in rates.\nIn addition, our businesses could experience breaches of security pertaining to sensitive customer, employee, and vendor information maintained by us in the normal course of business, which could adversely affect our reputation, diminish customer confidence, disrupt operations, materially increase the costs we incur to protect against these risks, and subject us to possible financial liability or increased regulation or litigation, any of which could adversely affect NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nFinancial and Economic Risks\nHOLDING COMPANY DIVIDEND RISK. As a holding company, NW Holdings depends on its operating subsidiaries, including NW Natural, to meet financial obligations and the ability of NW Holdings to pay dividends on its common stock is dependent on the receipt of dividends and other payments from its subsidiaries, including NW Natural.\nAs a holding company, NW Holdings\u2019 only significant assets are the stock and membership interests of its operating subsidiaries, which at this time is primarily NW Natural. NW Holdings\u2019 direct and indirect subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities,\nmanaged by their own boards of directors, and have no obligation to pay any amounts to their respective shareholders, whether through dividends, loans or other payments. The ability of these companies to pay dividends or make other distributions on their common stock is subject to, among other things: their results of operations, net income, cash flows and financial condition, as well as the success of their business strategies and general economic and competitive conditions; the prior rights of holders of existing and future debt securities and any future preferred stock issued by those companies; and any applicable legal restrictions.\nIn addition, the ability of NW Holdings\u2019 subsidiaries to pay upstream dividends and make other distributions is subject to applicable state law and regulatory restrictions. Under the OPUC and WUTC regulatory approvals for the holding company formation, if NW Natural ceases to comply with credit and capital structure requirements approved by the OPUC and WUTC, it will not, with limited exceptions, be permitted to pay dividends to NW Holdings. Under the OPUC and WUTC orders authorizing the holding company reorganization, NW Natural may not pay dividends or make distributions to NW Holdings if NW Natural\u2019s credit ratings and common equity levels fall below specified ratings and levels. If NW Natural\u2019s long-term secured credit ratings are below A- for S&P and A3 for Moody\u2019s, dividends may be issued so long as NW Natural\u2019s common equity is 45% or above. If NW Natural\u2019s long-term secured credit ratings are below BBB for S&P and Baa2 for Moody\u2019s, dividends may be issued so long as NW Natural\u2019s common equity is 46% or above. Dividends may not be issued if NW Natural\u2019s long-term secured credit ratings fall to BB+ or below for S&P or Ba1 or below for Moody\u2019s, or if NW Natural\u2019s common equity is below 44%. The ratio is measured using common equity and long-term debt excluding imputed debt or debt-like lease obligations, and is determined on a preceding or projected 13-month basis.\nEMPLOYEE BENEFIT RISK. The cost of providing pension and postretirement healthcare benefits is subject to changes in pension assets and liabilities, changing employee demographics and changing actuarial assumptions, which may have an adverse effect on NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nUntil NW Natural closed the pension plans to new hires, which for non-union employees was in 2006 and for union employees was in 2009, it provided pension plans and postretirement healthcare benefits to eligible full-time utility employees and retirees. Approximately 35% of NW Natural\u2019s current utility employees were hired prior to these dates, and therefore remain eligible for these plans. Other businesses we acquire may also have pension plans. The costs to NW Natural, or the other applicable businesses we may acquire, for providing such benefits is subject to change in the market value of the pension assets, changes in employee demographics including longer life expectancies, increases in healthcare costs, current and future legislative changes, and various actuarial calculations and assumptions. The actuarial assumptions used to calculate our future pension and postretirement healthcare expenses may differ materially from actual results due to significant market fluctuations and changing withdrawal rates, wage rates, interest rates and other factors. These differences may result in an adverse impact on the amount of pension contributions, pension expense or other postretirement benefit costs recorded in future periods. Sustained declines in equity markets and reductions in bond rates may have a material adverse effect on the value of the pension fund assets and liabilities. In these circumstances, NW Natural may be required to recognize increased contributions and pension expense earlier than it had planned to the extent that the value of pension assets is less than the total anticipated liability under the plans, which could have a negative impact on NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nHEDGING RISK. NW Natural\u2019s risk management policies and hedging activities cannot eliminate the risk of commodity price movements and other financial market risks, and its hedging activities may expose it to additional liabilities for which rate recovery may be disallowed, which could result in an adverse impact on NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s operating revenues, costs, derivative assets and liabilities and operating cash flows.\nNW Natural\u2019s gas purchasing requirements expose it to risks of commodity price movements, while its use of debt and equity financing exposes it to interest rate, liquidity and other financial market risks. NW Natural attempts to manage these exposures with both financial and physical hedging mechanisms, including its gas reserves transactions which are hedges backed by physical gas supplies. While NW Natural has risk management procedures for hedging in place, they may not always work as planned and cannot entirely eliminate the risks associated with hedging. Additionally, NW Natural\u2019s hedging activities may cause it to incur additional expenses to obtain the hedge. NW Natural does not hedge its entire interest rate or commodity cost exposure, and the unhedged exposure will vary over time. Gains or losses experienced through hedging activities, including carrying costs, generally flow through NW Natural\u2019s PGA mechanism or are recovered in future general rate cases. However, the hedge transactions NW Natural enters into for utility purposes are subject to a prudence review by the OPUC and WUTC, and, if found imprudent, those expenses may be, and have been previously, disallowed, which could have an adverse effect on NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, NW Natural\u2019s actual business requirements and available resources may vary from forecasts, which are used as the basis for its hedging decisions, and could cause its exposure to be more or less than anticipated. Moreover, if NW Natural\u2019s derivative instruments and hedging transactions do not qualify for regulatory deferral and it does not elect hedge accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP, NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nNW Natural also has credit-related exposure to derivative counterparties. Counterparties owing NW Natural or its subsidiaries money or physical natural gas commodities could breach their obligations. Should the counterparties to these arrangements fail\nto perform, NW Natural may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements to meet its normal business requirements. In that event, NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial results could be adversely affected. Additionally, under most of NW Natural\u2019s hedging arrangements, any downgrade of its senior unsecured long-term debt credit rating could allow its counterparties to require NW Natural to post cash, a letter of credit or other form of collateral, which would expose NW Natural to additional costs and may trigger significant increases in borrowing from its credit facilities or equity contribution needs from NW Holdings, if the credit rating downgrade is below investment grade. Further, based on current interpretations, NW Natural is not considered a \"swap dealer\" or \"major swap participant\" in 2021, so NW Natural is exempt from certain requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act. If NW Natural is unable to claim this exemption, it could be subject to higher costs for its derivatives activities, and such higher costs could have a negative impact on NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s operating costs and financial results.\nGAS PRICE RISK. Higher natural gas commodity prices and volatility in the price of gas may adversely affect NW Natural\u2019s NGD business, whereas lower gas price volatility may adversely affect NW Natural\u2019s gas storage business, negatively affecting NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s results of operations and cash flows.\nThe cost of natural gas is affected by a variety of factors, including weather, changes in demand, the level of production and availability of natural gas supplies, transportation constraints, availability and cost of pipeline capacity, federal and state energy and environmental regulation and legislation, natural disasters and other catastrophic events, national and worldwide economic and political conditions, and the price and availability of alternative fuels. At NW Natural, the cost we pay for natural gas is generally passed through to customers through an annual PGA rate adjustment. If gas prices were to increase significantly and remain higher, it could raise the cost of energy to NW Natural\u2019s customers, potentially causing those customers to conserve or switch to alternate sources of energy. Sustained significant price increases could also cause new home builders and commercial developers to select alternative energy sources. Decreases in the volume of gas NW Natural sells could reduce NW Holdings or NW Natural\u2019s earnings, and a decline in customers could slow growth in future earnings. Additionally, notwithstanding NW Natural\u2019s current rate structure, higher gas costs could result in increased pressure on the OPUC or the WUTC to seek other means to reduce NW Natural\u2019s rates, which also could adversely affect NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s results of operations and cash flows.\nTemporary gas price increases can also adversely affect NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s operating cash flows, liquidity and results of operations because a portion (10% or 20%) of any difference between the estimated average PGA gas cost in rate and the actual average gas cost incurred is recognized as current income or expense.\nTemporary or sustained higher gas prices may also cause NW Natural to experience an increase in short-term debt and temporarily reduce liquidity because it pays suppliers for gas when it is purchased, which can be in advance of when these costs are recovered through rates. Significant increases in the price of gas can also slow collection efforts as customers experience increased difficulty in paying their higher energy bills, leading to higher than normal delinquent accounts receivable resulting in greater expense associated with collection efforts and increased bad debt expense.\nINABILITY TO ACCESS CAPITAL MARKET RISK. NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s inability to access capital, or significant increases in the cost of capital, could adversely affect NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nNW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s ability to obtain adequate and cost effective short-term and long-term financing depends on maintaining investment grade credit profiles, perceptions of our business in capital markets, and the existence of liquid and stable financial markets. NW Holdings relies on access to equity and bank markets to finance equity contributions to subsidiaries and other business requirements. NW Natural relies on access to capital and bank markets, including commercial paper and bond markets, to finance its operations, construction expenditures and other business requirements, and to refund maturing debt that cannot be funded entirely by internal cash flows. Disruptions in capital markets, including but not limited to, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, political unrest, inflationary pressures, or rising interest rates could adversely affect our ability to access short-term and long-term financing. Our access to funds under committed credit facilities, which are currently provided by a number of banks, is dependent on the ability of the participating banks to meet their funding commitments. Those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity. Disruptions in the bank or capital financing markets as a result of economic uncertainty, changing or increased regulation of the financial sector, or failure of major financial institutions, or disruptions in credit markets, could adversely affect NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s access to capital and negatively impact our ability to run our businesses and make strategic investments.\nFurthermore, recent trends toward investments that are perceived to be \u201cgreen\u201d or \u201csustainable\u201d could shift capital away from, or increase the cost of capital for, our natural gas business. We believe our business is an important component of a low carbon future and are striving to decarbonize our systems. Nevertheless, perceptions in the financial markets could differ or outpace our decarbonization progress and result in a shift funding away from, or limit or restrict certain forms of funding for, natural gas businesses.\nNW Natural is currently rated by S&P and Moody\u2019s and a negative change in its credit ratings, particularly below investment grade, could adversely affect its cost of borrowing and access to sources of liquidity and capital. Such a downgrade could further limit its access to borrowing under available credit lines. Additionally, downgrades in its current credit ratings below investment grade could cause additional delays in NW Natural's ability to access the capital markets while it seeks supplemental state regulatory approval, which could hamper its ability to access credit markets on a timely basis. NW Holdings' credit profile is\nlargely supported by NW Natural\u2019s credit ratings and any negative change in NW Natural\u2019s credit ratings would likely negatively impact NW Holdings\u2019 access to sources of liquidity and capital and cost of borrowing. A credit downgrade to NW Natural, or resulting negative impact on NW Holdings, could also require additional support in the form of letters of credit, cash or other forms of collateral and otherwise adversely affect NW Holdings' or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nIMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS OR GOODWILL RISK. Impairments of the value of long-lived assets or goodwill could have a material effect on NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition, or results of operations.\nNW Holdings and NW Natural review the carrying value of long-lived assets other than goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. The determination of recoverability is based on the undiscounted net cash flows expected to result from the operation of such assets. Projected cash flows depend on the future operating costs and projected revenues associated with the asset.\nWe review the carrying value of goodwill annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying value may not be recoverable. A goodwill impairment analysis begins with a qualitative analysis of events and circumstances. If the qualitative assessment indicates that the carrying value may be at risk, we will perform a quantitative assessment and recognize a goodwill impairment for any amount in which the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. NW Holdings' total goodwill was $70.6 million as of December 31, 2021 and $69.2 million as of December 31, 2020. All of our goodwill is related to water and wastewater acquisitions. There have been no impairments recognized for the water and wastewater acquisitions to date. Any impairment charge taken with respect to our long-lived assets or goodwill could be material and could have a material effect on NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nCUSTOMER CONSERVATION RISK. Customers\u2019 conservation efforts may have a negative impact on NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s revenues.\nAn increasing national focus on energy conservation, including improved building practices and appliance efficiencies may result in increased energy conservation by customers. This can decrease NW Natural\u2019s sales of natural gas and adversely affect NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s results of operations because revenues are collected mostly through volumetric rates, based on the amount of gas sold. In Oregon, NW Natural has a conservation tariff which is designed to recover lost utility margin due to declines in residential and small commercial customers\u2019 consumption. However, NW Natural does not have a conservation tariff in Washington that provides it this margin protection on sales to customers in that state. Similar conservation risks exist for water utilities. Customers\u2019 conservation efforts may have a negative impact on NW Holdings' and NW Natural\u2019s financial condition, revenues and results of operations.\nWEATHER RISK. Warmer than average weather may have a negative impact on our revenues and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to weather risk in our natural gas business, primarily at NW Natural. A majority of NW Natural\u2019s gas volume is driven by gas sales to space heating residential and commercial customers during the winter heating season. Current NW Natural rates are based on an assumption of average weather. Warmer than average weather typically results in lower gas sales. Colder weather typically results in higher gas sales. Although the effects of warmer or colder weather on utility margin in Oregon are expected to be mitigated through the operation of NW Natural\u2019s weather normalization mechanism, weather variations from normal could adversely affect utility margin because NW Natural may be required to purchase more or less gas at spot rates, which may be higher or lower than the rates assumed in its PGA. Also, a portion of NW Natural\u2019s Oregon residential and commercial customers (usually less than 10%) have opted out of the weather normalization mechanism, and approximately 12% of its customers are located in Washington where it does not have a weather normalization mechanism. These effects could have an adverse effect on NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWater Business Risks\nWATER SECTOR BUSINESS. NW Holdings has entered the water sector through the acquisition of a number of water and wastewater companies. Water and wastewater businesses are subject to a number of risks in addition to the risks described above.\nAlthough the water businesses are not currently expected to materially contribute to the results of operations of NW Holdings, these businesses are subject to risks, in addition to those described above that could adversely affect their results of operations, including:\n\u2022contamination of water supplies, including water provided to customers with naturally occurring or human-made substances or other hazardous materials;\n\u2022interruptions in water supplies and service, natural disasters and droughts;\n\u2022disruptions to the wastewater collection and treatment process;\n\u2022conservation efforts by customers;\n\u2022regulatory and legal requirements, including environmental, health and safety laws and regulations;\n\u2022the outcome of rate cases and other regulatory proceedings; and\n\u2022weather conditions.\nSignificant losses, liabilities or impairments arising from these businesses may adversely affect NW Holdings' financial position or results of operations.\nINVESTMENT RISK. NW Holdings\u2019 expectations with respect to the financial results of its investments in water operations are based on various assumptions and beliefs that may not prove accurate, resulting in failures or delays in achieving expected returns or performance.\nNW Holdings\u2019 expansion into the water sector is an important component of its growth strategy. Although NW Holdings expects its water and wastewater utility operations will result in various benefits, including expanding customer bases, providing investment opportunities through infrastructure development and enhancing regulatory relationships within the local communities served, NW Holdings may not be able to realize these or other benefits. Achieving the anticipated benefits is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether the businesses acquired can be operated in the manner intended and whether costs to finance the acquisitions and investments will be consistent with expectations. Events outside of our control, including but not limited to regulatory changes or developments, could adversely affect our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from building NW Holdings\u2019 water platform. The integration of newly acquired water businesses may be unpredictable, subject to delays or changed circumstances, and such businesses may not perform in accordance with our expectations. In addition, anticipated costs, level of management\u2019s attention and internal resources to achieve the integration of the acquired businesses may differ significantly from our current estimates resulting in failures or delays in achieving expected returns or performance. If NW Holdings' expectations regarding the financial results of its investments in water operations prove to be inaccurate, it may adversely affect NW Holdings' financial position or results of operations.", "PERMNO": 58334, "SIC": 4924, "TIC": "NWN"}
