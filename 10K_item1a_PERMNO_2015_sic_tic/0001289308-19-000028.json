Stockholders are cautioned that these and other factors, including those beyond our control, may affect future performance and cause actual results to differ from those which may, from time to time, be anticipated. There may be additional risks that are not presently material or known. See \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d All forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf are qualified by the risks described below.\nWe operate in an extremely competitive industry and are subject to pricing pressures.\nWe compete with a number of major international manufacturers and distributors, as well as a large number of smaller, regional competitors. Due to excess capacity in some sectors of our industry and consolidation among industrial battery purchasers, we have been subjected to significant pricing pressures. We anticipate continued competitive pricing pressure as foreign producers are able to employ labor at significantly lower costs than producers in the U.S. and Western Europe, expand their export capacity and increase their marketing presence in our major Americas and European markets. Several of our competitors have strong technical, marketing, sales, manufacturing, distribution and other resources, as well as significant name recognition, established positions in the market and long-standing relationships with OEMs and other customers. In addition, certain of our competitors own lead smelting facilities which, during periods of lead cost increases or price volatility, may provide a competitive pricing advantage and reduce their exposure to volatile raw material costs. Our ability to maintain and improve our operating margins has depended, and continues to depend, on our ability to control and reduce our costs. We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to control our operating expenses, to raise or maintain our prices or increase our unit volume, in order to maintain or improve our operating results.\nThe uncertainty in global economic conditions could negatively affect the Company\u2019s operating results.\nOur operating results are directly affected by the general global economic conditions of the industries in which our major customer groups operate. Our business segments are highly dependent on the economic and market conditions in each of the geographic areas in which we operate. Our products are heavily dependent on the end markets that we serve and our operating results will vary by geographic segment, depending on the economic environment in these markets. Sales of our motive power products, for example, depend significantly on demand for new electric industrial forklift trucks, which in turn depends on end-user demand for additional motive capacity in their distribution and manufacturing facilities. The uncertainty in global\neconomic conditions varies by geographic segment, and can result in substantial volatility in global credit markets, particularly in the United States, where we service the vast majority of our debt. These conditions affect our business by reducing prices that our customers may be able or willing to pay for our products or by reducing the demand for our products, which could in turn negatively impact our sales and earnings generation and result in a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations and financial position.\nGovernment reviews, inquiries, investigations, and actions could harm our business or reputation.\nAs we operate in various locations around the world, our operations in certain countries are subject to significant governmental scrutiny and may be adversely impacted by the results of such scrutiny. The regulatory environment with regard to our business is evolving, and officials often exercise broad discretion in deciding how to interpret and apply applicable regulations. From time to time, we receive formal and informal inquiries from various government regulatory authorities, as well as self-regulatory organizations, about our business and compliance with local laws, regulations or standards. For example, certain of the Company\u2019s European subsidiaries have received subpoenas and requests for documents and, in some cases, interviews from, and have had on-site inspections conducted by the competition authorities of Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands relating to conduct and anticompetitive practices of certain industrial battery participants. The Company settled the Belgian regulatory proceeding in February 2016 by acknowledging certain anticompetitive practices and conduct and agreeing to pay a fine of $2.0 million, which was paid in March 2016. In June 2017, the Company settled a portion of its previously disclosed proceeding involving the German competition authority relating to conduct involving the Company's motive power battery business and agreed to pay a fine of $14.8 million, which was paid in July 2017. Also in June 2017, the German competition authority issued a fining decision related to the Company's reserve power battery business. The Company settled this matter by agreeing to pay $7.3 million, which was paid in April 2019. In July 2017, the Company settled the Dutch regulatory proceeding and agreed to pay a fine of $11.2 million, which was paid in August 2017. As of March 31, 2019, the Company had a total reserve balance of $7.3 million in connection with these investigations and related legal matters. However, the precise scope, timing and time period at issue, as well as the final outcome of the investigations or customer claims, remain uncertain and could be materially adverse to our business. (See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statement).\nAny determination that our operations or activities, or the activities of our employees, are not in compliance with existing laws, regulations or standards could result in the imposition of substantial fines, interruptions of business, loss of supplier, vendor, customer or other third-party relationships, termination of necessary licenses and permits, or similar results, all of which could potentially harm our business and/or reputation. Even if an inquiry does not result in these types of determinations, regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, and it potentially could create negative publicity which could harm our business and/or reputation.\nReliance on third party relationships and derivative agreements could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nWe depend on third parties, including suppliers, distributors, lead toll operators, freight forwarders, insurance brokers, commodity brokers, major financial institutions and other third party service providers, for key aspects of our business, including the provision of derivative contracts to manage risks of (a) commodity cost volatility, (b) foreign currency exposures and (c) interest rate volatility. Failure of these third parties to meet their contractual, regulatory and other obligations to the Company, or the development of factors that materially disrupt our relationships with these third parties, could expose us to the risks of business disruption, higher commodity and interest costs, unfavorable foreign currency rates and higher expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur operating results could be adversely affected by changes in the cost and availability of raw materials.\nLead is our most significant raw material and is used along with significant amounts of plastics, steel, copper and other materials in our manufacturing processes. We estimate that raw material costs account for over half of our cost of goods sold. The costs of these raw materials, particularly lead, are volatile and beyond our control. Additionally, availability of the raw materials used to manufacture our products may be limited at times resulting in higher prices and/or the need to find alternative suppliers. Furthermore, the cost of raw materials may also be influenced by transportation costs. Volatile raw material costs can significantly affect our operating results and make period-to-period comparisons extremely difficult. We cannot assure you that we will be able to either hedge the costs or secure the availability of our raw material requirements at a reasonable level or, even with respect to our agreements that adjust pricing to a market-based index for lead, pass on to our customers the increased costs of our raw materials without affecting demand or that limited availability of materials will not impact our production capabilities. Our inability to raise the price of our products in response to increases in prices of raw materials or to maintain a proper supply of raw materials could have an adverse effect on our revenue, operating profit and net income.\nOur operations expose us to litigation, tax, environmental and other legal compliance risks.\nWe are subject to a variety of litigation, tax, environmental, health and safety and other legal compliance risks. These risks include, among other things, possible liability relating to product liability matters, personal injuries, intellectual property rights, contract-related claims, government contracts, taxes, health and safety liabilities, environmental matters and compliance with U.S. and foreign laws, competition laws and laws governing improper business practices. We or one of our business units could be charged with wrongdoing as a result of such matters. If convicted or found liable, we could be subject to significant fines, penalties, repayments or other damages (in certain cases, treble damages). As a global business, we are subject to complex laws and regulations in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate. Those laws and regulations may be interpreted in different ways. They may also change from time to time, as may related interpretations and other guidance. Changes in laws or regulations could result in higher expenses and payments, and uncertainty relating to laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights.\nIn the area of taxes, changes in tax laws and regulations, as well as changes in related interpretations and other tax guidance could materially impact our tax receivables and liabilities and our deferred tax assets and tax liabilities. Additionally, in the ordinary course of business, we are subject to examinations by various authorities, including tax authorities. In addition to ongoing examinations, there could be additional investigations launched in the future by governmental authorities in various jurisdictions and existing investigations could be expanded. The global and diverse nature of our operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and contingencies will arise from time to time. Our results may be affected by the outcome of legal proceedings and other contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty.\nIn the manufacture of our products throughout the world, we process, store, dispose of and otherwise use large amounts of hazardous materials, especially lead and acid. As a result, we are subject to extensive and changing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things: the generation, handling, storage, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials; remediation of polluted ground or water; emissions or discharges of hazardous materials into the ground, air or water; and the health and safety of our employees. Compliance with these laws and regulations results in ongoing costs. Failure to comply with these laws or regulations, or to obtain or comply with required environmental permits, could result in fines, criminal charges or other sanctions by regulators. From time to time we have had instances of alleged or actual noncompliance that have resulted in the imposition of fines, penalties and required corrective actions. Our ongoing compliance with environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and permits could require us to incur significant expenses, limit our ability to modify or expand our facilities or continue production and require us to install additional pollution control equipment and make other capital improvements. In addition, private parties, including current or former employees, could bring personal injury or other claims against us due to the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous substances used, stored or disposed of by us or contained in our products.\nCertain environmental laws assess liability on owners or operators of real property for the cost of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous substances at their current or former properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances. These laws may also assess costs to repair damage to natural resources. We may be responsible for remediating damage to our properties caused by former owners. Soil and groundwater contamination has occurred at some of our current and former properties and may occur or be discovered at other properties in the future. We are currently investigating and monitoring soil and groundwater contamination at several of our properties, in most cases as required by regulatory permitting processes. We may be required to conduct these operations at other properties in the future. In addition, we have been and in the future may be liable to contribute to the cleanup of locations owned or operated by other persons to which we or our predecessor companies have sent wastes for disposal, pursuant to federal and other environmental laws. Under these laws, the owner or operator of contaminated properties and companies that generated, disposed of or arranged for the disposal of wastes sent to a contaminated disposal facility can be held jointly and severally liable for the investigation and cleanup of such properties, regardless of fault. Additionally, our products may become subject to fees and taxes in order to fund cleanup of such properties, including those operated or used by other lead-battery industry participants.\nChanges in environmental and climate laws or regulations could lead to new or additional investment in production designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures. Changes in climate change concerns, or in the regulation of such concerns, including greenhouse gas emissions, could subject us to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw materials costs. Additionally, we cannot assure you that we have been or at all times will be in compliance with environmental laws and regulations or that we will not be required to expend significant funds to comply with, or discharge liabilities arising under, environmental laws, regulations and permits, or that we will not be exposed to material environmental, health or safety litigation.\nAlso, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA applies to companies, individual directors, officers, employees and agents. Under the FCPA, U.S. companies may be held liable for actions taken by strategic or local partners or representatives. The FCPA also imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded U.S. corporations and their foreign affiliates, which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments. Certain of our customer relationships outside of the U.S. are with governmental entities and are therefore subject to such anti-bribery laws. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. Despite meaningful measures that we undertake to facilitate lawful conduct, which include training and internal control policies, these measures may not always prevent reckless or criminal acts by our employees or agents. As a result, we could be subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement, further changes or enhancements to our procedures, policies and controls, personnel changes or other remedial actions. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our operations, involve significant management distraction and result in a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nThere is also a regulation to improve the transparency and accountability concerning the supply of minerals coming from the conflict zones in and around the Democratic Republic of Congo. U.S. legislation included disclosure requirements regarding the use of conflict minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries and procedures regarding a manufacturer\u2019s efforts to prevent the sourcing of such conflict minerals. In addition, the European Union adopted a EU-wide conflict minerals rule under which most EU importers of tin, tungsten, tantalum, gold and their ores will have to conduct due diligence to ensure the minerals do not originate from conflict zones and do not fund armed conflicts. Large manufacturers also will have to disclose how they plan to monitor their sources to comply with the rules. Compliance with the regulation is required by January 1, 2021. The implementation of these requirements could affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of our products. As a result, there may only be a limited pool of suppliers who provide conflict-free metals, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Future regulations may become more stringent or costly and our compliance costs and potential liabilities could increase, which may harm our business.\nWe are exposed to exchange rate risks, and our net earnings and financial condition may suffer due to currency translations.\nWe invoice our foreign sales and service transactions in local and foreign currencies and translate net sales using actual exchange rates during the period. We translate our non-U.S. assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates as of the balance sheet dates. Because a significant portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies, changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies, primarily the euro, British pound, Polish zloty, Chinese renminbi, Mexican peso and Swiss franc may adversely affect our revenue, cost of goods sold and operating margins. For example, foreign currency depreciation against the U.S. dollar will reduce the value of our foreign revenues and operating earnings as well as reduce our net investment in foreign subsidiaries. Approximately 50% of net sales were generated outside of the United States for the last three fiscal years.\nMost of the risk of fluctuating foreign currencies is in our EMEA segment, which comprised approximately one-third of our net sales during the last three fiscal years. The euro is the dominant currency in our EMEA operations. In the event that one or more European countries were to replace the euro with another currency, our sales into such countries, or into Europe generally, would likely be adversely affected until stable exchange rates are established.\nThe translation impact from currency fluctuations on net sales and operating earnings in our Americas and Asia segments are not as significant as our EMEA segment, as a substantial majority of these net sales and operating earnings are in U.S. dollars or foreign currencies that have been closely correlated to the U.S. dollar.\nIf foreign currencies depreciate against the U.S. dollar, it would make it more expensive for our non-U.S. subsidiaries to purchase certain of our raw material commodities that are priced globally in U.S. dollars, while the related revenue will decrease when translated to U.S. dollars. Significant movements in foreign exchange rates can have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We periodically engage in hedging of our foreign currency exposures, but cannot assure you that we can successfully hedge all of our foreign currency exposures or do so at a reasonable cost.\nWe quantify and monitor our global foreign currency exposures. Our largest foreign currency exposure is from the purchase and conversion of U.S. dollar based lead costs into local currencies in Europe. Additionally, we have currency exposures from intercompany financing and intercompany and third party trade transactions. On a selective basis, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts and purchase option contracts to reduce the impact from the volatility of currency movements; however, we cannot be certain that foreign currency fluctuations will not impact our operations in the future.\nIf we are unable to effectively hedge against currency fluctuations, our operating costs and revenues in our non-U.S. operations may be adversely affected, which would have an adverse effect on our operating profit and net income.\nWe have experienced and may continue to experience, difficulties implementing our new global enterprise resource planning system.\nWe are engaged in a multi-year implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning system (\u201cERP\u201d). The ERP is designed to efficiently maintain our financial records and provide information important to the operation of our business to our management team. The ERP will continue to require significant investment of human and financial resources. In implementing the ERP, we have experienced significant production and shipping delays, increased costs and other difficulties. Any significant disruption or deficiency in the design and implementation of the ERP will adversely affect our ability to process orders, ship product, send invoices and track payments, fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business. While we have invested significant resources in planning, project management and training, additional and significant implementation issues may arise. In addition, our efforts to centralize various business processes and functions within our organization in connection with our ERP implementation may disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe failure to successfully implement efficiency and cost reduction initiatives, including restructuring activities, could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations, and we may not realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of those initiatives.\nFrom time to time we have implemented efficiency and cost reduction initiatives intended to improve our profitability and to respond to changes impacting our business and industry. These initiatives include relocating manufacturing to lower cost regions, working with our material suppliers to lower costs, product design and manufacturing improvements, personnel reductions and voluntary retirement programs, and strategically planning capital expenditures and development activities. In the past we have recorded net restructuring charges to cover costs associated with our cost reduction initiatives involving restructuring. These costs have been primarily composed of employee separation costs, including severance payments, and asset impairments or losses from disposal. We also undertake restructuring activities and programs to improve our cost structure in connection with our business acquisitions, which can result in significant charges, including charges for severance payments to terminated employees and asset impairment charges.\nWe cannot assure you that our efficiency and cost reduction initiatives will be successfully or timely implemented, or that they will materially and positively impact our profitability. Because our initiatives involve changes to many aspects of our business, the associated cost reductions could adversely impact productivity and sales to an extent we have not anticipated. In addition, our ability to complete our efficiency and cost-savings initiatives and achieve the anticipated benefits within the expected time frame is subject to estimates and assumptions and may vary materially from our expectations, including as a result of factors that are beyond our control. Furthermore, our efforts to improve the efficiencies of our business operations and improve growth may not be successful. Even if we fully execute and implement these activities and they generate the anticipated cost savings, there may be other unforeseeable and unintended consequences that could materially adversely impact our profitability and business, including unintended employee attrition or harm to our competitive position. To the extent that we do not achieve the profitability enhancement or other benefits of our efficiency and cost reduction initiatives that we anticipate, our results of operations may be materially adversely effected.\nOur international operations may be adversely affected by actions taken by foreign governments or other forces or events over which we may have no control.\nWe currently have significant manufacturing and/or distribution facilities outside of the United States, in Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, India, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, the People\u2019s Republic of China (\u201cPRC\u201d), Poland, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Our global operations are dependent upon products manufactured, purchased and sold in the U.S. and internationally, including in countries with political and economic instability or uncertainty. This includes, for example, the uncertainty related to the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union (commonly known as \u201cBrexit\u201d) and the adoption and expansion of trade restrictions, including the occurrence or escalation of a \"trade war,\" or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies among the governments of the United States, PRC and other countries. Some countries have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than others. Our business could be negatively impacted by adverse fluctuations in freight costs, limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products. Operating in different regions and countries exposes us to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nmultiple and potentially conflicting laws, regulations and policies that are subject to change;\n\u2022\nimposition of currency restrictions, restrictions on repatriation of earnings or other restraints imposition of burdensome import duties, tariffs or quotas;\n\u2022\nchanges in trade agreements;\n\u2022\nimposition of new or additional trade and economic sanctions laws imposed by the U.S. or foreign governments;\n\u2022\nwar or terrorist acts; and\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability or civil unrest that may severely disrupt economic activity in affected countries.\nThe occurrence of one or more of these events may negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur failure to introduce new products and product enhancements and broad market acceptance of new technologies introduced by our competitors could adversely affect our business.\nMany new energy storage technologies have been introduced over the past several years. For certain important and growing markets, such as aerospace and defense, lithium-based battery technologies have a large and growing market share. Our ability to achieve significant and sustained penetration of key developing markets, including aerospace and defense, will depend upon our success in developing or acquiring these and other technologies, either independently, through joint ventures or through acquisitions. If we fail to develop or acquire, and manufacture and sell, products that satisfy our customers\u2019 demands, or we fail to respond effectively to new product announcements by our competitors by quickly introducing competitive products, then market acceptance of our products could be reduced and our business could be adversely affected. We cannot assure you that our portfolio of primarily lead-acid products will remain competitive with products based on new technologies.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our proprietary intellectual property and technology.\nWe rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws, non-disclosure agreements and other confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to establish, protect and maintain our proprietary intellectual property and technology and other confidential information. Certain of these technologies, especially TPPL technology, are important to our business and are not protected by patents. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary intellectual property and technology and other confidential information, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property and proprietary technologies. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property and technology, we may lose any technological advantage we currently enjoy and may be required to take an impairment charge with respect to the carrying value of such intellectual property or goodwill established in connection with the acquisition thereof. In either case, our operating results and net income may be adversely affected.\nRelocation of our customers\u2019 operations could adversely affect our business.\nThe trend by a number of our North American and Western European customers to move manufacturing operations and expand their businesses in faster growing and low labor-cost markets may have an adverse impact on our business. As our customers in traditional manufacturing-based industries seek to move their manufacturing operations to these locations, there is a risk that these customers will source their energy storage products from competitors located in those territories and will cease or reduce the purchase of products from our manufacturing plants. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete effectively with\nmanufacturing operations of energy storage products in those territories, whether by establishing or expanding our manufacturing operations in those lower-cost territories or acquiring existing manufacturers.\nQuality problems with our products could harm our reputation and erode our competitive position.\nThe success of our business will depend upon the quality of our products and our relationships with customers. In the event that our products fail to meet our customers\u2019 standards, our reputation could be harmed, which would adversely affect our marketing and sales efforts. We cannot assure you that our customers will not experience quality problems with our products.\nWe offer our products under a variety of brand names, the protection of which is important to our reputation for quality in the consumer marketplace.\nWe rely upon a combination of trademark, licensing and contractual covenants to establish and protect the brand names of our products. We have registered many of our trademarks in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and in other countries. In many market segments, our reputation is closely related to our brand names. Monitoring unauthorized use of our brand names is difficult, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent their unauthorized use, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the U.S. We cannot assure you that our brand names will not be misappropriated or utilized without our consent or that such actions will not have a material adverse effect on our reputation and on our results of operations.\nWe may fail to implement our plans to make acquisitions or successfully integrate them into our operations.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have grown, and plan to continue growing, by acquiring other product lines, technologies or facilities that complement or expand our existing business, such as the acquisition of Alpha during fiscal 2019. There is significant competition for acquisition targets in the stored energy industry. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or negotiate attractive terms. In addition, we may have difficulty obtaining the financing necessary to complete transactions we pursue. In that regard, our credit facilities restrict the amount of additional indebtedness that we may incur to finance acquisitions and place other restrictions on our ability to make acquisitions. Exceeding any of these restrictions would require the consent of our lenders. Even if acquisition candidates are identified, we cannot be sure that our diligence will surface all material issues that may be present, including as they relate to inside Alpha or its business, or that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence, or that factors outside of such acquisition candidate or Alpha and their business and outside of their respective control will not arise later. If any such material issues arise, they may materially and adversely impact the on-going business of EnerSys and our stockholders\u2019 investment. We may be unable to successfully integrate any assets, liabilities, customers, systems and management personnel we acquire into our operations and we may not be able to realize related revenue synergies and cost savings within expected time frames. For example, the ability of Alpha and EnerSys to realize the anticipated benefits of the Alpha acquisition will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to combine Alpha\u2019s and our businesses in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities and realizes anticipated synergies, and achieves the projected stand-alone cost savings and revenue growth trends identified by each company. It is expected that we will benefit from operational and general and administrative cost synergies resulting from the warehouse and transportation integration, direct procurement savings on overlapping materials, purchasing scale on indirect spend categories and optimization of duplicate positions and processes. We may also enjoy revenue synergies, driven by a strong portfolio of brands with exposure to higher growth segments and the ability to leverage our collective distribution strength. In order to achieve these expected benefits, we must successfully combine the businesses of Alpha and EnerSys in a manner that permits these cost savings and synergies to be realized and must achieve the anticipated savings and synergies without adversely affecting current revenues and investments in future growth. If we experience difficulties with the integration process or are not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the Alpha acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. Our failure to execute our acquisition strategy could have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot assure you that our acquisition strategy will be successful or that we will be able to successfully integrate acquisitions we do make.\nAny acquisitions that we complete may dilute stockholder ownership interests in EnerSys, may have adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations and may cause unanticipated liabilities.\nFuture acquisitions may involve the issuance of our equity securities as payment, in part or in full, for the businesses or assets acquired. Any future issuances of equity securities would dilute stockholder ownership interests. In addition, future acquisitions might not increase, and may even decrease, our earnings or earnings per share and the benefits derived by us from an acquisition might not outweigh or might not exceed the dilutive effect of the acquisition. We also may incur additional debt or suffer adverse tax and accounting consequences in connection with any future acquisitions.\nThe failure or cyber security breach of critical computer systems could seriously affect our sales and operations.\nWe operate a number of critical computer systems throughout our business that can fail for a variety of reasons. If such a failure were to occur, we may not be able to sufficiently recover from the failure in time to avoid the loss of data or any adverse impact on certain of our operations that are dependent on such systems. This could result in lost sales and the inefficient operation of our facilities for the duration of such a failure.\nIn addition, our computer systems are essential for the exchange of information both within the company and in communicating with third parties. Despite our efforts to protect the integrity of our systems and network as well as sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, our facilities and systems and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches, theft, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors that could potentially lead to the compromising of sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, improper use of our systems, software solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of information, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness, and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to maintain adequate credit facilities.\nOur ability to continue our ongoing business operations and fund future growth depends on our ability to maintain adequate credit facilities and to comply with the financial and other covenants in such credit facilities or to secure alternative sources of financing. However, such credit facilities or alternate financing may not be available or, if available, may not be on terms favorable to us. If we do not have adequate access to credit, we may be unable to refinance our existing borrowings and credit facilities when they mature and to fund future acquisitions, and this may reduce our flexibility in responding to changing industry conditions.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of March 31, 2019, we had $1,036.5 million of total consolidated debt (including capital lease obligations). This level of debt could:\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions, including interest rate fluctuations, because a portion of our borrowings bear, and will continue to bear, interest at floating rates;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service payments, which would reduce the availability of our cash to fund working capital, capital expenditures or other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry;\n\u2022\nrestrict our ability to introduce new products or new technologies or exploit business opportunities;\n\u2022\nplace us at a disadvantage compared with competitors that have proportionately less debt;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds in the future, if we need them, due to financial and restrictive covenants in our debt agreements; and\n\u2022\nhave a material adverse effect on us if we fail to comply with the financial and restrictive covenants in our debt agreements.\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends at all or in any particular amounts.\nDuring fiscal 2019, we announced the declaration of a quarterly cash dividend of $0.175 per share of common stock for quarters ended July 1, 2018, September 30, 2018, December 30, 2018 and March 31, 2019. On May 16, 2019, we announced a fiscal 2020 first quarter cash dividend of $0.175 per share of common stock. Future payment of a regular quarterly cash dividend on our common shares will be subject to, among other things, our results of operations, cash balances and future cash requirements, financial condition, statutory requirements of Delaware law, compliance with the terms of existing and future indebtedness and credit facilities, and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant. Our dividend payments may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends at all or in any particular amounts. A reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments could have a negative effect on our share price.\nWe cannot guarantee that our share repurchase programs will be fully consummated or that they will enhance long-term stockholder value. Share repurchases could also increase the volatility of the trading price of our stock and could diminish our cash reserves.\nOur board of directors has authorized two share repurchase programs, one authorizing the repurchase of up to $100 million of our common stock, of which authority, as of March 31, 2019, approximately $69 million remains available and another authorizing the repurchase of up to such number of shares as shall equal the dilutive effects of any equity based award granted during such fiscal year and the number of shares exercised through stock option awards during such fiscal year. Although our board of directors has authorized these share repurchase programs, the programs do not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares. We cannot guarantee that the programs will be fully consummated or that they will enhance long-term stockholder value. The programs could affect the trading price of our stock and increase volatility, and any announcement of a termination of these programs may result in a decrease in the trading price of our stock. In addition, these programs could diminish our cash reserves.\nWe depend on our senior management team and other key employees, and significant attrition within our management team or unsuccessful succession planning could adversely affect our business.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to attract, retain and motivate senior management and other key employees. Achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions, competitors\u2019 hiring practices, cost reduction activities, and the effectiveness of our compensation programs. Competition for qualified personnel can be very intense. We must continue to recruit, retain and motivate senior management and other key employees sufficient to maintain our current business and support our future projects. We are vulnerable to attrition among our current senior management team and other key employees. A loss of any such personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if we are unsuccessful in our succession planning efforts, the continuity of our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\nOur income tax obligations are based in part on our corporate operating structure and intercompany arrangements, including the manner in which we operate our business, develop, value, manage, protect, and use our intellectual property and the valuations of our intercompany transactions. We may also be subject to additional indirect or non-income taxes. The tax laws applicable to our business, including the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions, are subject to interpretation and certain jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws in new ways in an effort to raise additional tax revenue from multi-national companies, like us. The taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Although we believe that our provision for income taxes is reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. In addition, our future income tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles.\nChanges in tax laws or tax rulings could materially affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe income and non-income tax regimes we are subject to or operate under are unsettled and may be subject to significant change. Changes in tax laws or tax rulings, or changes in interpretations of existing laws, could materially affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. For example, changes to U.S. tax laws enacted in December 2017 had a significant impact on our tax obligations and effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 and 2018. In addition, many countries in Europe, as well as a number of other countries and organizations, have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws that could significantly increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been working on a Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, and issued in 2015, and is expected to continue to issue, guidelines and proposals that may change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business. The European Commission has conducted investigations in\nmultiple countries focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation provides preferential tax treatment that violates European Union state aid rules and concluded that certain countries, including Ireland, have provided illegal state aid in certain cases. These investigations may result in changes to the tax treatment of our foreign operations. Due to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities, many of these types of changes to the taxation of our activities could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union could harm our business and financial results.\nIn June 2016, voters in the United Kingdom approved the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d). In March 2017, the UK government initiated the exit process under Article 50 of the Treaty of the European Union, commencing a period of up to two years for the United Kingdom and the other EU member states to negotiate the terms of the withdrawal, which has been extended for an additional six months. The British government and the European Union have now negotiated a withdrawal agreement, and the European Union has approved that agreement, but the British Parliament has not yet approved it. As a result, there remains considerable uncertainty around the withdrawal. Failure to obtain parliamentary approval of the negotiated withdrawal agreement would mean that the United Kingdom would leave the European Union on October 31, 2019, probably with no agreement (a so-called \"hard Brexit\"). The consequences for the economies of the European Union members and of the United Kingdom exiting the European Union are unknown and unpredictable, especially in the case of a hard Brexit. Depending on the final terms of Brexit, we could face new regulatory costs and challenges and greater volatility in the Pound Sterling and the euro. Any adjustments we make to our business and operations as of Brexit could result in significant time and expense to complete. Any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur software and related services are highly technical and may contain undetected software bugs or vulnerabilities, which could manifest in ways that could seriously harm our reputation and our business.\nThe software and related services that we offer, including those as a result of the Alpha acquisition, are highly technical and complex. Our services or any other products that we may introduce in the future may contain undetected software bugs, hardware errors, and other vulnerabilities. These bugs and errors can manifest in any number of ways in our products, including through diminished performance, security vulnerabilities, malfunctions, or even permanently disabled products. We have a practice of regularly updating our products and some errors in our products may be discovered only after a product has been used by users, and may in some cases be detected only under certain circumstances or after extended use. Any errors, bugs or other vulnerabilities discovered in our code or backend after release could damage our reputation, drive away users, allow third parties to manipulate or exploit our software, lower revenue and expose us to claims for damages, any of which could seriously harm our business. Additionally, errors, bugs, or other vulnerabilities may, either directly or if exploited by third parties, affect our ability to make accurate royalty payments.\nWe also could face claims for product liability, tort or breach of warranty. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, is costly and may divert management\u2019s attention and seriously harm our reputation and our business. In addition, if our liability insurance coverage proves inadequate or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all, our business could be seriously harmed.", "PERMNO": 90249, "SIC": 3690, "TIC": "ENS"}
