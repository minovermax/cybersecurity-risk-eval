{"cik": "1726173", "company": "Biglari Holdings Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nBiglari Holdings and its subsidiaries (referred to herein as \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d or similar expressions) are subject to certain risks and uncertainties in its business operations which are described below. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that are currently deemed immaterial may also impair our business operations.\nRisks relating to Biglari Holdings\nWe are dependent on our Chairman and CEO.\nOur success depends on the services of Sardar Biglari, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. All major investment and capital allocation decisions are made for the Company and its subsidiaries by Mr. Biglari. If for any reason the services of Mr. Biglari were to become unavailable, a material adverse effect on our business could occur.\nSardar Biglari, Chairman and CEO, beneficially owns over 50% of our outstanding shares of common stock, enabling Mr. Biglari to exert control over matters requiring shareholder approval.\nMr. Biglari has the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including the election or removal of directors, the amendment of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws, along with other significant transactions. In addition, Mr. Biglari has the ability to control the management and affairs of the Company. This control position may conflict with the interests of some or all of the Company\u2019s passive shareholders, and reduce the possibility of a merger proposal, tender offer or proxy contest for the removal of directors.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the New York Stock Exchange rules and thus can rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.\nBecause Mr. Biglari beneficially owns more than 50% of the Company\u2019s outstanding voting stock, we are considered a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d pursuant to New York Stock Exchange rules. As a result, we are not required to comply with certain director independence and board committee requirements. The Company does not have a governance and nominating committee.\nOur historical growth rate is not indicative of our future growth.\nWhen evaluating our historical growth and prospects for future growth, it is important to consider that while our business philosophy has remained constant our mix of business has changed and will continue to change. Our business model makes it difficult to assess our prospects for future growth.\nBiglari Holdings\u2019 access to capital is subject to restrictions that may adversely affect its ability to satisfy its cash requirements or implement its growth strategy.\nWe are a holding company and are largely dependent upon dividends and other sources of funds from our subsidiaries in order to meet our needs. The ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to Biglari Holdings is regulated by state insurance laws, which limit the amount of, and in certain circumstances may prohibit the payment of, cash dividends. Furthermore, as a result of our substantial investments in The Lion Fund, L.P. and The Lion Fund II, L.P., investment partnerships controlled by Mr. Biglari, our access to capital is restricted by the terms of their respective partnership agreements, as described more fully below. There is also a high likelihood that we will make additional investments in these investment partnerships.\nCompetition.\nEach of our operating businesses faces intense competitive pressure within the markets in which they operate. Competition may arise domestically as well as internationally. Accordingly, future operating results will depend to some degree on whether our operating units are successful in protecting or enhancing their competitive advantages. If our operating businesses are unsuccessful in these efforts, our periodic operating results may decline from current levels in the future. We also highlight certain competitive risks in the sections below.\nDeterioration of general economic conditions may significantly reduce our operating earnings.\nOur operating businesses are subject to normal economic cycles, which affect the general economy or the specific industries in which they operate. Significant deteriorations of economic conditions over a prolonged period could produce a material adverse effect on one or more of our significant operations.\nOur operating businesses face a variety of risks associated with doing business in foreign markets.\nThere is no assurance that our international operations will remain profitable. Our international operations are subject to all of the risks associated with our domestic operations, as well as a number of additional risks, varying substantially country by\ncountry. These include, inter alia, international economic and political conditions, corruption, terrorism, social and ethnic unrest, foreign currency fluctuations, differing cultures and consumer preferences.\nIn addition, we may become subject to foreign governmental regulations that impact the way we do business with our international franchisees and vendors. These include antitrust and tax requirements, anti-boycott regulations, international trade regulations, the USA Patriot Act, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and applicable local law. Failure to comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions, which could harm our business and our financial condition.\nEpidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks, including COVID-19, could hurt our operating businesses.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 has adversely affected, and in the future it or other epidemics, pandemics or outbreaks may adversely affect, our operations, including our investments. This is or may be due to closures or restrictions requested or mandated by governmental authorities, disruption to supply chains and workforce, reduction of demand for our products and services, credit losses when customers and other counterparties fail to satisfy their obligations to us, and volatility in global equity securities markets, among other factors.\nPotential changes in law or regulations may have a negative impact on our Class A common stock and Class B common stock.\nIn prior years, bills have been introduced in Congress that, if enacted, would have prohibited the listing of common stock on a national securities exchange if such common stock was part of a class of securities that has no voting rights or carries disproportionate voting rights. Although these bills have not been acted upon by Congress, there can be no assurance that such a bill (or a modified version thereof) will not be introduced in Congress in the future. Legislation or other regulatory developments could make the shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock ineligible for trading on the NYSE or other national securities exchanges.\nLitigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows and results of operations.\nWe are or may be from time to time a party to various legal actions, investigations and other proceedings brought by employees, consumers, policyholders, suppliers, shareholders, government agencies or other third parties in connection with matters pertaining to our business, including related to our investment activities. The outcome of such matters is often difficult to assess or quantify and the cost to defend future proceedings may be significant. Even if a claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any negative allegation regarding our Company, our business or our products could adversely affect our reputation. While we believe that the ultimate outcome of routine legal proceedings individually and in the aggregate will not have a material impact on our financial position, we cannot assure that an adverse outcome on, or reputational damage from, any of these matters would not, in fact, materially impact our business and results of operations for the period when these matters are completed or otherwise resolved.\nRisks Relating to Our Restaurant Operations\nOur restaurant operations face intense competition from a wide range of industry participants.\nThe restaurant business is one of the most intensely competitive industries. As there are virtually no barriers to entry into the restaurant business, competitors may include national, regional and local establishments. Restaurant businesses compete on the basis of price, convenience, service, experience, menu variety and product quality. The restaurant business is often affected by changes in consumer tastes and by national, regional, and local economic conditions. The performance of individual restaurants may be impacted by factors such as traffic patterns, demographic trends, weather conditions, and competing restaurants. Additional factors that may adversely affect the restaurant industry include, but are not limited to, food and wage inflation, safety, and food-borne illness.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic caused our restaurants to close their dining rooms in 2020. Many of Steak n Shake\u2019s competitors have reopened their dining rooms. Steak n Shake will reopen dining rooms only in restaurants it believes will provide excellent customer service.\nChanges in economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our restaurant operations.\nOur restaurant operations are subject to normal economic cycles affecting the economy in general or the restaurant industry in particular. The restaurant industry has been affected by economic factors, including the deterioration of global, national, regional and local economic conditions, declines in employment levels, and shifts in consumer spending patterns. Declines in consumer restaurant spending could be harmful to our financial position and results of operations. As a result, decreased cash flow generated from our business may adversely affect our financial position and our ability to fund our operations. In addition, macroeconomic disruptions could adversely impact the availability of financing for our franchisees\u2019 expansions and operations.\nFluctuations in commodity and energy prices and the availability of commodities, including beef and dairy, could affect our restaurant business.\nThe cost, availability and quality of ingredients restaurant operations use to prepare their food is subject to a range of factors, many of which are beyond their control. A significant component of our restaurant business\u2019 costs is related to food commodities, including beef and dairy products, which can be subject to significant price fluctuations due to seasonal shifts, climate conditions, industry demand, changes in commodity markets, and other factors. If there is a substantial increase in prices for these food commodities, our results of operations may be negatively affected. In addition, our restaurants are dependent upon frequent deliveries of perishable food products that meet certain specifications. Shortages or interruptions in the supply of perishable food products caused by unanticipated demand, problems in production or distribution, disease or food-borne illnesses, inclement weather, or other conditions could adversely affect the availability, quality, and cost of ingredients, which would likely lower revenues, damage our reputation, or otherwise harm our business.\nAdverse weather conditions or losses due to casualties could negatively impact our operating performance.\nProperty damage caused by casualties and natural disasters, instances of inclement weather, flooding, hurricanes, fire, and other acts of nature can adversely impact sales in several ways. Many of Steak n Shake\u2019s and Western Sizzlin\u2019s restaurants are located in the Midwest and Southeast portions of the United States. During the first and fourth quarters, restaurants in the Midwest may face harsh winter weather conditions. During the third and fourth quarters, restaurants in the Southeast may experience hurricanes or tropical storms. Our sales and operating results may be negatively affected by these harsh weather conditions, which could make it more difficult for guests to visit our restaurants, necessitate the closure of restaurants, cause physical damage, or lead to a shortage of employees.\nWe are subject to health, employment, environmental, and other government regulations, and failure to comply with existing or future government regulations could expose us to litigation or penalties, damage our reputation, and lower profits.\nWe are subject to various global, federal, state, and local laws and regulations affecting our restaurant operations. Changes in existing laws, rules and regulations applicable to us, or increased enforcement by governmental authorities, may require us to incur additional costs and expenses necessary for compliance. If we fail to comply with any of these laws, we may be subject to governmental action or litigation, and our reputation could be accordingly harmed. Injury to our reputation would, in turn, likely reduce revenues and profits.\nThe development and construction of restaurants is subject to compliance with applicable zoning, land use, and environmental regulations. Difficulties in obtaining, or failure to obtain, the required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the development of a new restaurant in a particular area.\nIn recent years, there has been increased legislative, regulatory, and consumer focus on nutrition and advertising practices in the food industry. As a result, restaurant operations have become subject to regulatory initiatives in the area of nutrition disclosure or advertising, such as requirements to provide information about the nutritional content of our food products. The operation of the Steak n Shake and Western Sizzlin franchise system is also subject to franchise laws and regulations enacted by a number of states, and to rules promulgated by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. Any future legislation regulating franchise relationships may negatively affect our operations, particularly our relationship with franchisees. Failure to comply with new or existing franchise laws and regulations in any jurisdiction or to obtain required government approvals could result in a ban or temporary suspension on future franchise sales. Further national, state and local government initiatives, such as mandatory health insurance coverage, or proposed increases in minimum wage rates could adversely affect our business.\nRisks Relating to Our Investment Activities\nThe majority of our investment activities are conducted through outside investment partnerships, The Lion Fund, L.P. and The Lion Fund II, L.P., which are controlled by Mr. Biglari.\nOur investment activities are conducted mainly through these outside investment partnerships. Under the terms of their partnership agreements, each contribution made by the Company to the investment partnerships is subject to a five-year lock-up period, and any distribution upon our withdrawal of funds will be paid out over a two-year period (and may be paid in-kind rather than in cash, thus increasing the difficulty of liquidating these investments). As a result of these provisions and our consequent inability to access this capital for a defined period, our capital invested in the investment partnerships may be subject to an increased risk of loss of all or a significant portion of value, and we may become unable to meet our capital requirements. There is a high likelihood that we will make additional investments in these investment partnerships in the future.\nWe also have a services agreement with Biglari Capital Corp., the general partner of the investment partnerships (\u201cBiglari Capital\u201d), and Biglari Enterprises LLC (collectively, the \u201cBiglari Entities\u201d), in which the Company pays a fixed fee to the Biglari Entities for business and administrative-related services. The Biglari Entities are owned by Mr. Biglari. There can be no assurance that the fees paid will be commensurate with the benefits received.\nThe incentive allocation to which Mr. Biglari, as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Biglari Capital, is entitled under the terms of the respective partnership agreements is equal to 25% of the net profits allocated to the limited partners in excess of a 6% hurdle rate over the previous high-water mark.\nOur investments may be concentrated and fair values are subject to a loss in value.\nThe majority of our investments are held through the investment partnerships, which generally invest in common stocks. These investments may be largely concentrated in the common stocks of a few investees. A significant decline in the major values of these investments may produce a large decrease in our consolidated shareholders\u2019 equity and can have a material adverse effect on our consolidated book value per share and earnings.\nWe are subject to the risk of possibly becoming an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940.\nWe run the risk of inadvertently becoming an investment company, which would require us to register under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d). Registered investment companies are subject to extensive, restrictive and potentially adverse regulations relating to, among other things, operating methods, management, capital structure, dividends and transactions with affiliates. Registered investment companies are not permitted to operate their business in the manner in which we operate our business, nor are registered investment companies permitted to have many of the relationships that we have with our affiliated companies.\nTo avoid becoming and registering as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we operate as an ongoing enterprise, with approximately 4,000 employees, along with an asset base from which to pursue acquisitions. Furthermore, Section 3(c)(3) of the Investment Company Act excludes insurance companies from the definition of \u201cinvestment company\u201d. Because we monitor the value of our investments and structure transactions accordingly, we may structure transactions in a less advantageous manner than if we did not have Investment Company Act concerns, or we may avoid otherwise economically desirable transactions due to those concerns. In addition, adverse developments with respect to our ownership of certain of our operating subsidiaries, including significant appreciation or depreciation in the market value of certain of our publicly traded holdings, could result in our inadvertently becoming an investment company. If it were established that we were an investment company, there would be a risk, among other material adverse consequences, that we could become subject to monetary penalties or injunctive relief, or both, in an action brought by the SEC, that we would be unable to enforce contracts with third parties or that third parties could seek to obtain rescission of transactions with us undertaken during the period it was established that we were an unregistered investment company.\nRisks Relating to Our Insurance Business\nOur success depends on our ability to underwrite risks accurately and to charge adequate rates to policyholders.\nOur results of operations depend on our ability to underwrite and set rates accurately for risks assumed. A primary role of the pricing function is to ensure that rates are adequate to generate sufficient premiums to pay losses, loss adjustment expenses, and underwriting expenses.\nOur insurance business is vulnerable to significant catastrophic property loss, which could have an adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nOur insurance business faces a significant risk of loss in the ordinary course of its business for property damage resulting from natural disasters, man-made catastrophes and other catastrophic events. These events typically increase the frequency and severity of commercial property claims. Because catastrophic loss events are by their nature unpredictable, historical results of operations may not be indicative of future results of operations, and the occurrence of claims from catastrophic events may result in significant volatility in our insurance business\u2019 financial condition and results of operations from period to period. We attempt to manage our exposure to these events through reinsurance programs, although there is no assurance we will be successful in doing so.\nOur insurance business is subject to extensive existing state, local and foreign governmental regulations that restrict its ability to do business and generate revenues.\nOur insurance business is subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which it operates. These regulations may relate to, among other things, the types of business that can be written, the rates that can be charged for coverage, the level of capital and reserves that must be maintained, and restrictions on the types and size of investments that can be placed. Regulations may also restrict the timing and amount of dividend payments. Accordingly, existing or new regulations related to these or other matters or regulatory actions imposing restrictions on our insurance business may adversely impact its results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Media and Licensing Business\nOur media business faces significant competition from other magazine publishers and other forms of media, including digital media, and as a result our media business may not be able to improve its operating results.\nOur media business competes principally with other magazine publishers. The proliferation of choices available to consumers for information and entertainment has resulted in audience fragmentation and has negatively impacted overall consumer demand for print magazines and intensified competition with other magazine publishers for share of print magazine readership. Our media business also competes with digital publishers and other forms of media. This competition has intensified as a result of the proliferation of mobile devices and the shift in consumer preference from print media to digital media for the delivery and consumption of content.\nCompetition among print magazine and digital publishers for advertising is primarily based on the circulation and readership of magazines and the number of visitors to websites, respectively, and the demographics of customers, advertising rates, plus the effectiveness of advertising sales teams. The proliferation of new platforms available to advertisers, combined with continuing competition from print platforms, has impacted both the amount of advertising our media business is able to sell and the rates it can command.\nOur pursuit of licensing opportunities for the Maxim brand may prove to be unsuccessful.\nMaxim\u2019s success depends to a significant degree upon its ability to develop new licensing agreements to expand its brand. However, these licensing efforts may be unsuccessful. We may be unable to secure favorable terms for future licensing arrangements, which could lead to, among other things, disputes with licensing partners that hinder our ability to grow the Maxim brand. Future licensing partners may also fail to honor their contractual obligations or take other actions that can diminish the value of the Maxim brand. Disputes could also arise that prevent or delay our ability to collect licensing revenues under these arrangements. If any of these developments occur or our licensing efforts are otherwise not successful, the value and recognition of the Maxim brand, as well as the prospects of our media business, could be materially, adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Our Oil and Gas Business\nOur oil and gas business is exposed to the effects of volatile commodity prices.\nThe single largest variable that affects Southern Oil\u2019s results of operations is the price of crude oil and natural gas. The price we receive for our oil and natural gas production heavily influences Southern Oil\u2019s revenue and profitability. Extended periods of low prices for crude oil or natural gas can have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nOur scope of business is concentrated in the shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico.\nAny disruption of its extractive business would adversely affect Southern Oil\u2019s revenues and profitability. Southern Oil\u2019s operations are therefore subject to disruption from natural or human causes beyond its control, including physical risks from hurricanes, severe storms, and other forms of system failures, any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment.\nOur oil and gas business can be adversely affected by political or regulatory developments affecting our operations.\nSouthern Oil\u2019s operations can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments. Litigation or changes in national, state, or local environmental regulations or laws, including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and natural gas, could adversely affect Southern Oil\u2019s operations and profitability.", "PERMNO": 26607, "SIC": 5812, "TIC": "BH"}
