{"cik": "64040", "company": "S&P Global Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-09", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. These risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or which we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations.\nWe operate in the capital and commodities markets. The capital markets include asset managers, investment banks, commercial banks, insurance companies, exchanges, trading firms, and issuers; the commodities markets include producers, traders and intermediaries within energy, metals, petrochemicals and agriculture. Certain risk factors are applicable to certain of our individual segments while other risk factors are applicable Company-wide.\nMerger Risks\nThe Merger is subject to conditions, some or all of which may not be satisfied, or completed on a timely basis, if at all. Failure to complete, or unexpected delays in completing, the merger or any termination of the Merger Agreement could have material adverse effects on us.\nOn November 29, 2020, we, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Sapphire Subsidiary, Ltd., a Bermuda exempted company limited by shares (the \u201cMerger Sub\u201d), and IHS Markit, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended on January 20, 2021, the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d), pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into IHS Markit, with IHS Markit surviving such merger as a wholly-owned, our direct subsidiary. Completion of the Merger is subject to a number of conditions, including, among other things, the receipt of approval from our shareholders and the shareholders of IHS Markit, and the receipt of certain regulatory approvals, as well as the accuracy of all representations and warranties of IHS Markit and the absence of a material adverse effect since the date of the merger agreement, which make the completion and timing of the Merger uncertain. In addition, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could delay the receipt of certain regulatory approvals. The failure to satisfy all of the required conditions could delay the completion of the merger for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring at all. There can be no assurance that the conditions to the completion of the Merger will be satisfied or waived or that the Merger will be completed.\nIn addition, either S&P Global or IHS Markit may terminate the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances, including if the Merger is not completed by the outside date determined pursuant to the Merger Agreement. In certain circumstances, upon termination of the Merger Agreement, S&P Global would be required to pay a termination fee of $2.380 billion to IHS Markit, and in certain circumstances, IHS Markit would be required to pay a termination fee of $1.075 billion to S&P Global, upon termination of the Merger Agreement, each as contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nMoreover, at any time before or after the completion of the Merger, and notwithstanding the termination of applicable waiting periods, the applicable U.S. or foreign regulatory authorities or any state attorney general could take such action under antitrust or other applicable laws as such party deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such action could include, among other things, seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties.\nIn addition, shareholders of both S&P Global and IHS Markit have initiated private actions challenging, seeking to enjoin or seeking to impose conditions on the Merger. We may be required to devote significant resources to resolve such matters which may have a negative effect on our ability to complete the Merger and if we do complete the Merger may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf the Merger is not completed, we may be materially adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the Merger, will be subject to a number of risks, including the following: the market price of our common stock could decline; if the Merger agreement is terminated and our board seeks another business combination, shareholders cannot be certain that we will be able to find a party willing to enter into a transaction on terms equivalent to or more attractive than the terms that IHS Markit has agreed to in the Merger Agreement; we will not realize the benefit of the time and resources, financial and otherwise, committed by our management to matters relating to the Merger that could have been devoted to pursuing other beneficial opportunities; we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets or from their respective customers, suppliers or employees; and we will be required to pay its expenses relating to the Merger, such as legal, accounting and financial advisory fees, whether or not the Merger is completed.\nIn addition, if the Merger is not completed, we could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the Merger or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against such party to perform its obligations under the Merger Agreement. Any of these risks could materially and adversely impact our ongoing business, financial condition, results of operations and the market price of our common stock. Similarly, delays in the completion of the Merger could, among other things, result in\nadditional transaction costs, loss of revenue or other negative effects associated with delay and uncertainty about completion of the merger and could materially and adversely impact our ongoing business, financial condition, results of operations and the market price of our common stock.\nWe are subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Merger is pending, which could adversely affect our business and operations.\nIn connection with the pendency of the Merger, it is possible that some customers, suppliers, partners and other persons with whom we have a business relationship may delay or defer certain business decisions or might decide to seek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationships with us as a result of the Merger or otherwise, which could negatively affect our revenue, earnings and/or cash flow, as well as the market price of our common stock, regardless of whether the Merger is completed. In addition, under the terms of the Merger Agreement, we are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of its business prior to completing the Merger, which may adversely affect our ability to execute certain of its business strategies, including the ability in certain cases to acquire or dispose of assets or pay dividends or incur capital expenditures above a certain amount. Such limitations could adversely our business and operations prior to the completion of the Merger.\nWe may be unable to successfully integrate the businesses of S&P Global and IHS Markit or realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger.\nThe success of the Merger will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine and integrate our existing business with that of IHS Markit, and realize the anticipated benefits, including synergies, cost savings, innovation and technological opportunities and operational efficiencies from the Merger in a manner that does not materially disrupt existing customer, supplier and employee relations and does not result in decreased revenues due to losses of, or decreases in demand by, customers. Our ability to realize these anticipated benefits is subject to certain risks, including whether we will perform as expected, the possibility that we paid more for IHS Markit than the value we will derive from the Merger and the assumption of known and unknown liabilities of IHS Markit. If we are unable to achieve these objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the anticipated benefits may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, and the value of our common stock may decline. We may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the Merger if the integration process takes longer than expected or is more costly than expected.\nThe integration of the two companies may result in material challenges, including: managing a larger, more complex combined business; maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees; retaining existing business and operational relationships, including customers, suppliers and employees and other counterparties, as may be impacted by contracts containing consent and/or other provisions that may be triggered by the merger, and attracting new business and operational relationships; consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations, including unanticipated issues in integrating financial reporting, information technology infrastructure, data and content management systems and product platforms, communications and other systems; coordinating geographically separate organizations, including consolidating offices of S&P Global and IHS Markit that are currently in or near the same location; harmonizing both companies\u2019 corporate cultures, operating practices, employee development and compensation programs, internal controls, compliance programs and other policies, procedures and processes; addressing possible differences in business backgrounds, and management philosophies; and unforeseen expenses or delays associated with the Merger.\nMany of these factors will be outside of our control, and any one of them could result in delays, increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and other adverse impacts, which could materially affect the combined company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. Due to legal restrictions, S&P Global and IHS Markit are currently permitted to conduct only limited planning for the integration of the two companies following the Merger. The actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, and the anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized on a timely basis, if at all.\nWe expect to incur substantial expenses and devote significant resources in connection with the completion of the Merger and the integration of the IHS Markit and our businesses.\nWe expect to incur substantial expenses, and devote significant resources, in connection with the completion of the Merger and the integration of a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems of S&P Global and IHS Markit in connection with the Merger. The management of the combined company may face significant challenges in implementing such integration, many of which may be beyond the control of management and which may result in increased costs and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy, as well as materially adversely impact the anticipated synergies of the Merger and the business, financial condition and results of operations of the combined company. The integration process and other disruptions resulting from the Merger may also adversely affect the combined company\u2019s relationships with employees, suppliers, customers, distributors and others with whom S&P Global and IHS Markit have business or other dealings, and difficulties in integrating the businesses of S&P Global and IHS Markit could harm the reputation of the combined company.\nThese incremental transaction-related costs may exceed the savings the combined company expects to achieve from the elimination of duplicative costs and the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, particularly in the near term and in the event there are material unanticipated costs. Factors beyond the parties\u2019 control could affect the total amount or timing of these expenses, many of which, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately. Some of these expenses have already been incurred or may be incurred regardless of whether the merger is completed.\nIf the Merger is completed, our shareholders\u2019 ownership percentage will be diluted.\nIf the Merger is completed, we will issue to IHS Markit shareholders shares of our common stock. As a result of the issuance of these shares of our common stock, our shareholders will own a smaller percentage of the combined company after the Merger and will therefore have a reduced voting interest.\nDuring the pendency of the merger our ability to execute share repurchases will be restricted.\nWhile the Merger is pending, we will have limited opportunities to launch repurchase programs and there can no guarantee that we will be able to successfully execute a repurchase program when a window of opportunity presents itself.\nCOVID-19 Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and its effects have affected, and may have a material adverse effect on, our results of operations.\nFollowing the outbreak of an infectious respiratory illness caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d), the World Health Organization declared a global emergency on January 30, 2020 and subsequently declared COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.\nCOVID-19 has spread globally, including in the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and other jurisdictions in which we operate. Governments across the world have taken steps to contain the virus by restricting human movement through numerous measures including travel bans and restrictions, social distancing, quarantines, shelter in place orders, enhanced health screenings at ports of entry and elsewhere, and business shutdowns. Continuation of the shutdown of businesses and entire industries, increases in unemployment, implementation of furloughs, lost wages across populations and a significant drop in consumer and business spending, resulted in a recession in the United States during 2020. While vaccines have become available, their availability and distribution is at the discretion of government agencies and it is difficult to ascertain how and when they will impact economic activity. There are no comparable recent events that can provide guidance as to the effect of the COVID-19 global pandemic, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of the coronavirus outbreak or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain. The effects of COVID-19 have impacted our operations and may ultimately have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in the future. The extent to which the pandemic will continue to affect our businesses, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nIncreased volatility and uncertainty in the global economy, and the financial and commodities markets\nThe global economy has been disrupted as a result of the ongoing health crisis and the financial and commodities markets have reacted with unprecedented volatility. Governmental authorities worldwide have taken increased measures to stabilize the markets and support economic growth. The success of these measures is unknown, and they may not be sufficient to address the market dislocations or avert severe and prolonged reductions in economic activity. Even after the pandemic subsides, the U.S. economy and other major economies may continue to experience a recession, and we anticipate our businesses would be materially and adversely affected by a prolonged recession in the U.S. and other major markets. Because there are no comparable recent events that can provide guidance on the impact to the global economy, we cannot predict the extent to which our business may be impacted. In addition, the increase in revenue of Ratings in 2020 was primarily driven by higher corporate bond issuance in the U.S. mainly resulting from historically low borrowing costs, increased borrowing demand from companies to increase their liquidity in light of uncertainties associated with COVID-19, and central bank lending actions. There can be no guarantee that such favorable conditions would continue in the future, and our businesses, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected absent such favorable conditions. Moreover, the unprecedented volatility observed in the markets since the outset of COVID-19 may result in sudden unexpected changes in market structures that were not previously anticipated by laws, rules, regulations or general market practices. Risks posed to our businesses, financial condition and results of operations from volatility in the financial and commodities markets are described in the risk factor below entitled, \u201cChanges in the volume of securities issued and traded in domestic and/or global capital markets, asset levels and flows into investment products, changes in interest rates and volatility in the financial markets, and volatility in the commodities markets impact our business, financial condition or results of operations\u201d.\nDecreased demand for our subscription services\nOur clients are being impacted to varying degrees. Some may no longer be in business by the time the COVID-19 pandemic comes to an end, others will face significant spending constraints in order to continue to operate, and others may reduce their workforces permanently. As a result of the impact on our clients, our subscription services may face pricing pressure on renewals, delayed renewals, and challenges to new sales which would in turn reduce revenue, ultimately impacting our results of operations. Limited human mobility has, among other things, significantly reduced demand for energy used in transportation, and the decrease in demand has been exacerbated by political tensions between large oil producing countries.\nThis could put additional pressure on Platts clients and translate into slower demand for our subscription and related products and services. Moreover, while our business continuity program has been effective to date, the current restrictions on human mobility limit our ability to interact with subscribers and effectively demonstrate new products and may have a negative effect on our ability to secure new subscriptions and renewals.\nOur businesses assess and analyze the impact of economic events\nOur divisions are all actively engaged in analyzing and providing views on the quickly evolving economic conditions. We are publishing articles and research pieces that attempt to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the world economy and its components, both geographic and sectoral. In addition, we are taking actions (including, but not limited to, rating actions, revising the composition of our indices, etc.), consistent with our business procedures, in response to the evolving conditions. Notwithstanding the care we take in carrying out our work, the views and assumptions we express, the conclusions we draw, the actions we take, and the work our divisions are producing today are likely to be heavily scrutinized with the benefit of hindsight. We have faced significant regulatory and media scrutiny following prior periods of volatility and economic uncertainty. Such scrutiny has in the past and may in the future impact our reputation, brand and credibility and result in government and regulatory proceedings, investigations, inquiries and litigation. See the below risk factors entitled \u201cExposure to litigation and government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations\u201d and \u201cOur reputation, credibility, and brand are key assets and competitive advantages of our Company and our business may be affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace\u201d.\nBusiness continuity\nOur business continuity program has been effective to date. Since mid-March 2020, nearly our entire employee population was working remotely. While we have been able to continue our operations during this time, maintaining a remote work environment for an extended period of time may have a material adverse effect on our productivity and our ability to meet the needs of our clients and exposes us to operational risks. See the below risk factor entitled \u201cOur inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability\u201d. In addition, a portion of our information technology resources have been diverted to establishing and maintaining an infrastructure that supports a sustained remote working environment. Such efforts limit the resources available for improvement and innovation projects. Moreover, given the extent to which we are utilizing a remote working environment, we face increased vulnerability. Although there has not been a cyber attack that has had a material adverse effect on the Company to date, we have noted an increase in cyber threats targeted at our remote work environment and there can be no assurance that there will not be a material adverse effect in the future. See the below risk factor entitled \u201cWe are exposed to risks related to cybersecurity and protection of confidential information\u201d. In addition, while our employee base currently has adequate resources to pursue new clients or expand existing relationships, we have no control over the business continuity resources available to our clients. As a result, our ability to maintain, expand, or establish new client relationships may be limited.\nBusiness, Operational and Regulatory Risks\nChanges in the volume of securities issued and traded in domestic and/or global capital markets, asset levels and flows into investment products, changes in interest rates and volatility in the financial markets, and volatility in the commodities markets impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\u2022Our business is impacted by general economic conditions and volatility in the U.S. and world financial markets.\n\u2022Economic conditions and volatility across the globe are generally affected by negative or uncertain economic and political conditions. In addition, natural and man-made disasters as well as the outbreak of pandemic or contagious diseases introduce volatility and uncertainty into the global capital and commodities markets and negatively impact general economic conditions. Volatile, negative or uncertain economic and political conditions in our significant markets have undermined and could in the future undermine business confidence in our significant markets or in other markets, which are increasingly interdependent. Because we operate globally and have significant businesses in many markets, increased volatility or an economic slowdown in any of those markets could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\u2022Since a significant component of our credit-rating based revenue is transaction-based, and is essentially dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets, unfavorable financial or economic\nconditions that either reduce investor demand for debt securities or reduce issuers\u2019 willingness or ability to issue such securities tend to reduce the number and dollar volume of debt issuances for which Ratings provides credit ratings.\n\u2022Our Indices business is impacted by market volatility, asset levels of investment products tracking indices, and trading volumes of certain exchange traded derivatives. Volatile capital markets, as well as changing investment styles, among other factors, may influence an investor\u2019s decision to invest in and maintain an investment in an index-linked investment product.\n\u2022Increases in interest rates or credit spreads, volatility in financial markets or the interest rate environment, significant political or economic events, defaults of significant issuers and other market and economic factors may negatively impact the general level of debt issuance, the debt issuance plans of certain categories of borrowers, the level of derivatives trading and/or the types of credit-sensitive products being offered, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\u2022Our Platts business is impacted by volatility in the commodities markets. Weak economic conditions, especially in our key markets, including the energy industry, could reduce demand for our products, impacting our revenues and margins. As a result of volatility in commodity prices and trading activity in physical commodities and commodities derivatives, we may encounter difficulty in achieving sustained market acceptance of past or future contract terms, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u2022Any weakness in the macroeconomic environment could constrain customer budgets across the markets we serve, potentially leading to a reduction in their employee headcount and a decrease in demand for our subscription-based products.\n\u2022The foregoing factors generally affect our performance and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are exposed to risks related to cybersecurity and protection of confidential information.\n\u2022Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential, sensitive and other types of data and information in our computer systems and networks and those of our third-party vendors.\n\u2022All of our businesses have access to material non-public information concerning the Company\u2019s customers, including sovereigns, corporate issuers and other third parties around the world, the unauthorized disclosure of which could affect the trading markets for such customers\u2019 securities and could damage such customers\u2019 competitive positions. The cyber risks the Company faces range from cyber attacks common to most industries, to more sophisticated and targeted attacks, some of which may be carried out by state-sponsored actors, intended to obtain unauthorized access to certain information or systems due in part to our prominence in the global marketplace, such as our ratings on debt issued by sovereigns and corporate issuers, or the composition of our indices. Unauthorized disclosure of this information could cause our customers to lose faith in our ability to protect their confidential information and therefore cause customers to cease doing business with us.\n\u2022We experience cyber attacks of varying degrees on a regular basis. Although there has not been a cyber attack that has had a material adverse effect on the Company to date, there can be no assurance that there will not be a material adverse effect in the future.\n\u2022Breaches of our or our vendors\u2019 systems and networks, whether from circumvention of security systems, denial-of-service attacks or other cyber attacks, hacking, computer viruses or malware, employee error, malfeasance, physical breaches or other actions, may cause material interruptions or malfunctions in our or such vendors\u2019 websites, applications or data processing, or may compromise the confidentiality and integrity of material information regarding us, our business or our customers. In the ordinary course, our third-parties, including our vendors, are subject to various forms of cyber attacks. To date, such attacks have not resulted in a material adverse impact to our business or operations, but there can be no guarantee we will not experience such an impact.\n\u2022Misappropriation, improper modification, destruction, corruption or unavailability of our data and information due to cyber incidents, attacks or other security breaches could damage our brand and reputation, result in litigation and regulatory actions, and lead to loss of customer confidence in our security measures and reliability, which would harm our ability to retain customers and gain new ones.\n\u2022Although we devote significant resources to maintain and regularly update our systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of our computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets and the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information belonging to the enterprise and our customers, clients and employees, there is no assurance that all of our security measures will provide absolute security.\n\u2022Measures that we take to avoid or mitigate material incidents can be expensive, and may be insufficient, circumvented, or become obsolete. While we have not experienced a material incident to date, any material incident could cause us to experience reputational harm, loss of customers, regulatory actions, sanctions or other statutory penalties, litigation or financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us, and increased expenses related to addressing or mitigating the risks associated with any such material incidents.\n\u2022Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and are becoming increasingly sophisticated and include denial of service attacks, ransomware, phishing attacks and payment fraud. Despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, as cyber threats evolve and become more difficult to detect and successfully defend against, one or more cyber threats might defeat the measures that we or our vendors take to anticipate, detect, avoid or mitigate such threats. Certain techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, introduce malicious software, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems may be designed to remain dormant until a triggering event and we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures since techniques change frequently or are not recognized until launched.\n\u2022Given the extent to which our businesses are privy to material non-public information concerning our customers, our data could be improperly used, including for insider trading by our employees and third party vendors with access to key systems. We have experienced insider trading incidents involving employees in the past, and it is not always possible to deter misconduct by employees or third party vendors. We take precautions to detect and prevent such activity, including implementing and training on insider trading policies for our employees and contractual obligations for our third party vendors, but such precautions are not guaranteed to deter misconduct. Any breach of our clients\u2019 confidences as a result of employee or third party vendor misconduct could harm our reputation.\n\u2022The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by us to run our business could result in significantly increased security costs or costs related to defending legal claims.\n\u2022An actual or perceived breach of our security may harm the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures and result in damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in the security of our products and services. Media or other reports of existing or perceived security vulnerabilities in our systems or those of our third-party business partners or service providers can also adversely impact our brand and reputation and materially impact our business.\n\u2022Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in the legislative, regulatory, and commercial environments in which we operate may materially and adversely impact our ability to collect, compile, use, and publish data and may impact our financial results.\n\u2022Global privacy legislation, enforcement, and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and creating a complex regulatory compliance environment. Costs to comply with and implement these privacy-related and data protection measures could be significant. In addition, an inadvertent failure to comply with federal, state, or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations despite our best efforts could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others.\n\u2022Certain types of information we collect, compile, use, and publish, including offerings in all our businesses, and particularly our Market Intelligence business, are subject to regulation by governmental authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, there is increasing concern among certain privacy advocates and government regulators regarding marketing and privacy matters, particularly as they relate to individual privacy interests.\n\u2022There has been increased public attention regarding the use of personal information and data transfer, accompanied by legislation and regulations intended to strengthen data protection, information security and consumer and personal privacy. The law in these areas continues to develop and the changing nature of privacy laws in the U.S., the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) and elsewhere could impact our processing of personal and sensitive information of our employees, vendors and customers.\n\u2022The EU's comprehensive General Data Privacy Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d) became fully effective in 2018. GDPR requires companies to satisfy requirements regarding the handling of personal and sensitive data, including its use, protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves.\n\u2022Failure to comply with GDPR requirements could result in penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue. GDPR and other similar laws and regulations, as well as any associated inquiries or investigations or any other government actions, may be costly to comply with, result in negative publicity, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, and subject us to remedies that may harm our business, including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices.\n\u2022The California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) became fully effective January 1, 2020, requiring, among other things, covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, and afford such consumers new abilities to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. The CCPA provides a new private right of action for data breaches and requires companies that process information on California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices and allow consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties.\n\u2022Our reputation and brand and our ability to attract new customers could also be adversely impacted if we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to properly respond to security breaches of our or third party\u2019s information technology systems. Such failure to properly respond could also result in similar exposure to liability.\n\u2022We devote meaningful time and financial resources to compliance with the GDPR, the CCPA and other current and future applicable international and U.S. privacy, cybersecurity and related laws. We have made capital investments and other expenditures to address cybersecurity preparedness and prevent future breaches, including costs associated with additional security technologies, personnel, experts and credit monitoring services for those whose data has been breached, but there can be no assurance that we will not need to make significant additional expenditures. These costs, which could be material, could adversely impact our results of operations in the period in which they are incurred and may not meaningfully limit the success of future attempts to breach our information technology systems.\n\u2022In addition, the EU and other jurisdictions, including China, are considering imposing or have already imposed additional restrictions, including in relation to cross-border transfers of personal data. These requirements are increasing in complexity and number, change frequently and increasingly conflict among the various countries in which we operate, which could result in greater compliance risk and cost for us.\n\u2022Continued privacy concerns may result in new or amended laws and regulations. Future laws and regulations with respect to the collection, compilation, use, and publication of information and consumer privacy could result in limitations on our operations, increased compliance or litigation expense, adverse publicity, or loss of revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. It is also possible that we could be prohibited from collecting or disseminating certain types of data, which could affect our ability to meet our customers\u2019 needs.\n\u2022We may also from time to time be subject to, or face assertions that we are subject to, additional obligations relating to personal data by contract or due to assertions that self-regulatory obligations or industry standards apply to our practices.\nExposure to litigation and government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\u2022In the normal course of business, both in the United States and abroad, we and our subsidiaries are defendants in numerous legal proceedings and are often the subject of government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries, as discussed under Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and we face the risk that additional proceedings, investigations and inquiries will arise in the future.\n\u2022Many of these proceedings, investigations and inquiries relate to the activity of our Ratings, Indices, and Platts businesses. In addition, various government and self-regulatory agencies frequently make inquiries and conduct investigations into our compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including those related to our regulated activities and antitrust matters.\n\u2022Any of these proceedings, investigations or inquiries could ultimately result in adverse judgments, damages, fines, penalties or activity restrictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\u2022In view of the uncertainty inherent in litigation and government and regulatory enforcement matters, we cannot predict the eventual outcome of the matters we are currently facing or the timing of their resolution, or in most cases reasonably estimate what the eventual judgments, damages, fines, penalties or impact of activity restrictions may be. As a result, we cannot provide assurance that the outcome of the matters we are currently facing or that we may face in the future will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\u2022As litigation or the process to resolve pending matters progresses, as the case may be, we continuously review the latest information available and assess our ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects, if any, on our consolidated financial condition, cash flows, business and competitive position, which may require that we record liabilities in the consolidated financial statements in future periods.\n\u2022Legal proceedings impose additional expenses on the Company and require the attention of senior management to an extent that may significantly reduce their ability to devote time addressing other business issues.\n\u2022Risks relating to legal proceedings may be heightened in foreign jurisdictions that lack the legal protections or liability standards comparable to those that exist in the United States. In addition, new laws and regulations have been and may continue to be enacted that establish lower liability standards, shift the burden of proof or relax pleading requirements, thereby increasing the risk of successful litigations against the Company in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. These litigation risks are often difficult to assess or quantify and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\u2022We may not have adequate insurance or reserves to cover these risks, and the existence and magnitude of these risks often remains unknown for substantial periods of time and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIncreasing regulation of our Ratings business in the United States, Europe and elsewhere can increase our costs of doing business and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\u2022The financial services industry is highly regulated, rapidly evolving and subject to the potential for increasing regulation in the United States, Europe and elsewhere. The businesses conducted by Ratings are in certain cases regulated under the Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of 2006 (the \u201cReform Act\u201d), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), and/or the laws of the states or other jurisdictions in which they conduct business.\n\u2022In the past several years, the U.S. Congress, the International Organization of Securities Commissions (\"IOSCO\"), the SEC and the European Commission, including through the European Securities Market Authority (\"ESMA\"), as well as regulators in other countries in which Ratings operates, have been reviewing the role of rating agencies and their processes and the need for greater oversight or regulations concerning the issuance of credit ratings or the activities of credit rating agencies. Other laws, regulations and rules relating to credit rating agencies are being considered by local, national and multinational bodies and are likely to continue to be considered in the future, including provisions seeking to reduce regulatory and investor reliance on credit ratings, and liability standards applicable to credit rating agencies.\n\u2022These laws and regulations, and any future rule-making, could result in reduced demand for credit ratings and increased costs, which we may be unable to pass through to customers. In addition, there may be uncertainty over the scope, interpretation and administration of such laws and regulations. We may be required to incur significant expenses in order to comply with such laws and regulations and to mitigate the risk of fines, penalties or other sanctions. Legal proceedings could become increasingly lengthy and there may be uncertainty over and exposure to liability. It is difficult to accurately assess the future impact of legislative and regulatory requirements on our business and our customers\u2019 businesses, and they may affect Ratings\u2019 communications with issuers as part of the rating assignment process, alter the manner in which Ratings\u2019 ratings are developed, affect the manner in which Ratings or its customers or users of credit ratings operate, impact the demand for ratings and alter the economics of the credit ratings business. Each of these developments increases the costs and legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings and may have a material adverse effect on our operations, profitability and competitiveness, the demand for credit ratings and the manner in which such ratings are utilized.\n\u2022Additional information regarding rating agencies is provided under Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur Indices and Platts businesses are subject to new and evolving regulatory regimes in Europe and the potential for increased or changing regulations in the United States and elsewhere. Our Indices business is subject to a new regulatory regime in Australia. Our Indices and Platts businesses are subject to additional regulation in Europe. This changing regulatory landscape can increase our exposure, compliance risk and costs of doing business globally and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\u2022In addition to the extensive and evolving U.S. laws and regulations, foreign jurisdictions have taken measures to increase regulation of the financial services and commodities industries.\n\u2022In October of 2012, IOSCO issued its Principles for Oil Price Reporting Agencies (\"PRA Principles\"), which IOSCO states are intended to enhance the reliability of oil price assessments that are referenced in derivative contracts subject to regulation by IOSCO members. Platts has taken steps to align its operations with the PRA Principles and, as recommended by IOSCO in its final report on the PRA Principles, has aligned to the PRA Principles for other commodities for which it publishes benchmarks.\n\u2022In July of 2013, IOSCO issued its Principles for Financial Benchmarks (\"Financial Benchmark Principles\"), which are intended to promote the reliability of the benchmark determination process by setting standards related to benchmark governance, benchmark quality, transparency and accountability mechanisms, including with regard to the indices and benchmarks published by Indices. Indices has taken steps to align its governance regime, control framework and operations with the Financial Benchmark Principles and engages an independent auditor to perform an annual reasonable assurance review of its adherence to the Financial Benchmark Principles.\n\u2022The benchmark industry is subject to regulation in the EU (the \u201cEU Benchmark Regulation\u201d) as well as potential increased regulation of financial benchmarks in other jurisdictions. The EU Benchmark Regulation was published on June 30, 2016, with provisions applicable to Indices and Platts, effective from January 1, 2018. ESMA published additional guidance clarifying that existing benchmark administrators such as Platts could utilize the transitional provisions contained in the EU Benchmark Regulation, which provided them two (2) years to implement and seek authorization by an EU National Competent Authority by January 1, 2020, with their respective benchmark activities in Europe. Indices and Platts are now both supervised by the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets. This legislation will likely cause additional operating obligations, greater compliance risk and costs for Indices and Platts but they are not expected to be material at this time, although the exact impact remains unclear.\n\u2022Indices is subject to the benchmark regulation in Australia under which it is required to obtain a license from and be subject to the supervision of the Australian Securities and Investment Commission regarding its administration of the S&P ASX 200 index. This legislation will likely cause additional operating obligations, greater compliance risk and costs for Indices but they are not expected to be material at this time, although the exact impact remains unclear.\n\u2022The EU's package of legislative measures called the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and Regulation (collectively \"MiFID II\") entered into force in 2014, revising and updating the prior Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (2004) and its associated secondary legislation. The substantive provisions of MiFID II apply in all EU Member States since 2018. MiFID II includes provisions that, among other things: (i) mandate conditions and requirements on the licensing of benchmarks for the purposes of clearing related securities and provide for non-discriminatory access to exchanges and clearing houses for this purpose; (ii) modify the categorization and treatment of certain classes of derivatives; (iii) expand the categories of trading venues that are subject to regulation; (iv) require the unbundling of investment research from other services, including execution services, and direct that investment firms must pay for research either out of a dedicated research payment account which is paid for by clients or from the investment firm\u2019s profits; and (v) provide for the mandatory trading of certain derivatives on exchanges (complementing the mandatory derivative clearing requirements in the EU Market Infrastructure Regulation of 2011, or EMIR). The MiFID II package may result in changes to the manner in which S&P Dow Jones Indices and Platts license their indices and price assessments, respectively, and could also have an indirect impact on the credit ratings and third-party research products offered by other divisions of the Company for use within the EU. MiFID II and the Market Abuse Regulation (\u201cMAR\u201d) may impose additional regulatory burdens on the activities of S&P Dow Jones Indices and Platts in the EU, although the exact impact and costs are not yet known.\nOur international business activities must comport with U.S. international trade restraints, including economic sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Controls.\n\u2022As a global company headquartered in the U.S., we are subject to U.S. laws and regulations, including economic sanction laws. These laws include prohibitions or restrictions on the sale or supply of certain products and services to embargoed or sanctioned countries, regions, governments, persons and entities.\n\u2022Embargoes and sanctions laws are changing rapidly for certain geographies, including with respect to Iran, Russia, and Venezuela. These embargoes and sanctions laws may affect our ability to continue to market and/or sell our products and services into these geographies and in turn adversely impact our revenue from such geographies.\n\u2022Additional international trade restraints may be promulgated at any time and may require changes to our operations and increase our risk of noncompliance.\n\u2022Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can result in significant fines and penalties and related material adverse effects on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur acquisitions and other strategic transactions may not produce anticipated results.\n\u2022In addition to the Merger, we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions or enter into other strategic transactions to strengthen our business and grow our Company. Such transactions present significant challenges and risks.\n\u2022The market for acquisition targets and other strategic transactions is highly competitive, especially in light of industry consolidation, which may affect our ability to complete such transactions.\n\u2022If we are unsuccessful in completing such transactions or if such opportunities for expansion do not arise, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\n\u2022If such transactions are completed, the anticipated growth and other strategic objectives of such transactions may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected, and a variety of factors may adversely affect any anticipated benefits from such transactions. For instance, the process of integration may require more resources than anticipated, we may assume unintended liabilities, there may be unexpected regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures, we may fail to retain key personnel of the acquired business and such transactions may divert management\u2019s focus from other business operations.\n\u2022The failure of acquisitions and other strategic transactions to perform as expected could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may become subject to liability based on the use of our products by our clients.\n\u2022Some of our products support the investment processes and other activities of our clients, which, in the aggregate, manage trillions of dollars of assets. Use of our products as part of such activities, including the investment process creates the risk that clients, or the parties whose assets are managed by our clients, may pursue claims against us for\nvery significant dollar amounts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\u2022The products we develop or license, and the proprietary methodologies, models and processes on which these products rely, may contain undetected errors or defects, despite testing and/or other quality assurance practices. Such errors may exist during any part of a product\u2019s life cycle and may persist notwithstanding testing and/or other quality assurance practices. Deploying products containing such errors may damage our reputation, and the costs associated with remediating such errors may have an impact on our profitability.\n\u2022Any claim relating to our products, even if the outcome were to be ultimately favorable to us, would involve a significant commitment of our management, personnel, financial and other resources and could have a negative impact on our reputation. In addition, such claims and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIncreased competition could result in a loss of market share or revenue.\n\u2022The markets for credit ratings, financial research, market data, index-based products, and commodities price assessments and related news and information about these markets are intensely competitive. Ratings, Market Intelligence, Platts and Indices compete domestically and internationally on the basis of a number of factors, including the quality of their offerings, client service, reputation, price, geographic scope, range of products and technological innovation.\n\u2022While our businesses face competition from traditional content and analytics providers (including exchanges), we also face competition from non-traditional providers, such as asset managers, investment banks and technology-led companies that are adding content and analytics capabilities to their core businesses.\n\u2022In addition, in some of the countries in which Ratings competes, governments may provide financial or other support to locally-based rating agencies and may from time to time establish official credit rating agencies, credit ratings criteria or procedures for evaluating local issuers.\n\u2022Sustained downward pressure on oil and other commodities prices and trading activity in those markets could have a material adverse effect on the rate of growth of Platts\u2019 revenue, including subscription and licensing fees.\nIntroduction of new or enhanced products and services could impact our profitability.\n\u2022We operate in highly competitive markets that continue to change to adapt to customer needs.\n\u2022In order to maintain a competitive position, we must continue to invest in new offerings and enhancements, including new ways to deliver our products and services.\n\u2022These new or enhanced offerings resulting from our investments may not achieve market acceptance, may not be profitable or may be less profitable than what we have experienced historically.\n\u2022We could experience threats to our existing businesses from the rise of new competitors due to the rapidly changing environment in which we operate.\nOur ability to develop, adapt, or implement new and improved processes and technology may adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\u2022The rapid change of technology is a key feature of all of the markets in which we operate. To succeed in the future, we will need to deploy improved processes and technology to innovate, design, develop, assemble, test, market, and support new products and enhancements to our existing products in a timely and cost-effective manner.\n\u2022Innovation and constant development in support of new products and enhancements to existing products calls for the implementation of new and improved processes and technologies that require related change management efforts. While we employ a certain level of internal and external resources to mitigate the risks associated with implementing process and technology improvements, we may face unexpected challenges in execution that may require more management attention than expected, thus diverting management time and energy from other businesses. The foregoing and other unforeseen factors could also result in business being disrupted for a period of time as well as additional commitments of financial resources.\nA significant increase in operating costs and expenses could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.\n\u2022Our major expenditures include employee compensation and capital investments.\n\u2022We offer competitive salary and benefit packages in order to attract and retain the quality employees required to grow and expand our businesses. Compensation costs are influenced by general economic factors, including those affecting the cost of health insurance and postretirement benefits, and any trends specific to the employee skill sets we require.\n\u2022We make significant investments in information technology data centers and other technology initiatives and we cannot provide assurances that such investments will result in increased revenues.\n\u2022Although we believe we are prudent in our investment strategies and execution of our implementation plans, there is no assurance as to the ultimate recoverability of these investments.\nIncreased availability of free or relatively inexpensive information sources may reduce demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\u2022In recent years, more public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information have become available, particularly through the Internet, and advances in public cloud computing and open source software may continue.\n\u2022Public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information can reduce demand for our products and services. Demand could also be reduced as a result of cost-cutting initiatives at certain companies and organizations. Although we believe our products are enhanced by our analysis, tools and applications, our financial results may be adversely affected if our customers choose to use these public sources as a substitute for our products or services.\nConsolidation of customers as well as staffing levels across our customer base could impact our available markets and revenue growth.\n\u2022Our businesses have a customer base which is largely comprised of members from the corporate, financial services and commodities industries. The consolidation of customers resulting from mergers and acquisitions across these industries can result in reductions in the number of firms and workforce which can impact the size of our customer base.\n\u2022Our customers that strive to reduce their operating costs may seek to reduce their spending on our products and services. If a large number of smaller customers or a critical number of larger customers reduce their spending with us, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n\u2022Alternatively, customers may use other strategies to reduce their overall spending on financial and commodity market products and services by consolidating their spending with fewer vendors, including by selecting other vendors with lower-cost offerings, or by self-sourcing their need for financial and commodity market products and services. If customers elect to consolidate their spending on financial and commodity market products and services with other vendors and not us, if we lose business to lower priced competitors, or if customers elect to self-source their product and service needs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n\u2022A material portion of our revenues in our Indices business is concentrated in some of our largest customers, who have significant assets under management in index funds and exchange-traded funds. A loss of a substantial portion of revenue from our largest customers could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we lose key outside suppliers of data and products or if the data or products of these suppliers have errors or are delayed, we may not be able to provide our clients with the information and products they desire.\n\u2022Our ability to produce our products and develop new products is dependent upon the products of other suppliers, including certain data, software and service suppliers. Some of our products and their related value are dependent upon updates from our data suppliers and most of our information and data products are dependent upon continuing access to historical and current data.\n\u2022We utilize certain data provided by third-party data sources in a variety of ways, including large volumes of data from certain stock exchanges around the world.\n\u2022If the data from our suppliers has errors, is delayed, has design defects, is unavailable on acceptable terms or is not available at all, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\u2022Some of our agreements with data suppliers allow them to cancel on short notice. Termination of one or more of our significant data agreements or exclusion from, or restricted use of, or litigation in connection with, a data provider\u2019s information could decrease the available information for us to use (and offer our clients) and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur ability to protect our intellectual property rights could impact our competitive position.\n\u2022We consider many of our products and services to be proprietary. Failure to protect our intellectual property adequately could harm the value of and revenue generated by such assets as well as our reputation and affect our ability to compete effectively. Businesses we acquire may also have intellectual property portfolios which increase the complexity of managing our intellectual property portfolio and protecting our competitive position.\n\u2022Our products contain intellectual property delivered through a variety of digital and other media. Our ability to achieve anticipated results depends in part on our ability to defend our intellectual property rights against infringement and\nmisappropriation. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by inadequate or changing legal and technological protections for intellectual property and proprietary rights in some jurisdictions and markets. For example, we do business in a number of countries included on the Priority Watch List maintained by the Office of the United States Trade Representative and which are currently thought to afford less protection to intellectual property rights generally than some other jurisdictions. The lack of strong patent and other intellectual property protection in such jurisdictions referenced above may significantly increase our vulnerability as regards unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property and undermine our competitive position.\n\u2022Our products also contain intellectual property of third party sources. Any violation by us of the intellectual property rights of such third parties could result in termination of the relevant source agreement, litigation and reputational damage which could materially and adversely affects our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFuture legislation, regulatory reform or policy changes, especially abrupt changes, could have a material effect on our business and results of operations.\n\u2022Future legislation, regulatory reform or policy changes, such as financial services regulatory reform, U.S. oil regulation, government-sponsored enterprise reform and increased infrastructure spending and significant changes in trade policy (including sanctions), could impact our business. Changes in legislation, regulation or policy increase the likelihood that we will fail to appropriately adapt to changes in our compliance obligations, particularly when such changes happen abruptly, such as following a change in government. Any of the forgoing changes could impact our results of operations and cash flows directly; such changes may also impact our business by creating increased volatility and uncertainty in the financial and commodities markets. At this time, we cannot predict the scope or nature of these changes or assess what the overall effect of such potential changes could be on our results of operations or cash flows.\nRegulatory changes and economic conditions leading up to and following the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the EU could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\u2022Voters in the United Kingdom (\"UK\") approved an exit from the EU via a referendum in 2016 and in 2017, the UK invoked Article 50 of the Treaty on the EU, commencing the process to leave the EU (\u201cBrexit\u201d) and on January 31, 2020, the UK formally exited the EU. The EU and the UK concluded the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement on December 24, 2020, which took effect provisionally on January 1, 2021 following the end of the formal transition period.\n\u2022Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations between the UK and the EU as the UK determines which EU laws to replace or replicate and the EU determines how to treat regulated activities (e.g., the activities of credit rating agencies) originating in the UK. Our businesses are subject to increasing regulation of the financial services and commodities industries in Europe. Potential changes in EU regulation, divergent interpretations by the UK of any replicated EU laws and/or additional regulation in the UK could cause additional operating obligations and increased costs for our businesses. In particular, our Ratings business, for the first time, is subject to regulation by the Financial Conduct Authority effective January 1, 2021.\n\u2022Changes to UK immigration policy as a result of Brexit could adversely affect our ability to retain talent for our European operations.\n\u2022Any of these effects of Brexit, and others we cannot anticipate, could adversely affect our business, business opportunities, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The lack of certainty creates the risk that notwithstanding that we have devoted valuable resources to a thorough preparation for the impact of Brexit on our European operations, we may not be adequately prepared for an unforeseen outcome.\nOur inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability.\n\u2022In addition to the COVID Risks outlined above, should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem, such as an earthquake, hurricane, flood, terrorist attack, another outbreak of pandemic or contagious diseases, security breach, cyber attack, power loss, telecommunications failure or other natural or man-made disaster, our ability to continue to operate will depend, in part, on the availability of our personnel, our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer, telecommunication and other related systems and operations. In such an event, we could experience operational challenges with regard to particular areas of our operations, such as key executive officers or personnel, that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\u2022We regularly assess and take steps to improve our existing business continuity plans and key management succession. However, a disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions, or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem, could\nmaterially interrupt our business operations and result in material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, damaged client relationships or legal liability.\nOutsourcing certain aspects of our business could result in disruption and increased costs.\n\u2022We have outsourced certain functions to third-party service providers to leverage leading specialized capabilities and achieve cost efficiencies. Outsourcing these functions involves the risk that the third-party service providers may not perform to our standards or legal requirements, may not produce reliable results, may not perform in a timely manner, may not maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information, or may fail to perform at all. Failure of these third parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, confidentiality, or other obligations to us could result in material financial loss, higher costs, regulatory actions and reputational harm.\n\u2022Outsourcing these functions also involves the risk that the third-party service providers may not maintain adequate physical, technical and administrative safeguards to protect the security of our confidential information and data. Failure of these third parties to maintain these safeguards could result in unauthorized access to our systems or a system or network disruption that could lead to improper disclosure of confidential information or data, regulatory penalties and remedial costs.\n\u2022We also rely on the business infrastructure and systems of third parties with whom we do business and to whom we outsource the maintenance and development of operational and technological functionality, including third-party cloud infrastructure. Our cloud infrastructure providers, or other service providers, could experience system breakdowns or failures, outages, downtime, cyber attacks, adverse changes to financial condition, bankruptcy or other adverse conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation. Thus, our plans to increase the amount of our infrastructure that we outsource to \u201cthe cloud\u201d or to other third parties may increase our risk exposure.\nWe rely heavily on network systems and the Internet and any failures or disruptions may adversely affect our ability to serve our customers.\n\u2022Many of our products and services are delivered electronically, and our customers rely on our ability to process transactions rapidly and deliver substantial quantities of data on computer-based networks. Our customers also depend on the continued capacity, reliability and security of our electronic delivery systems, our websites and the Internet.\n\u2022Our ability to deliver our products and services electronically may be impaired due to infrastructure or network failures, malicious or defective software, human error, natural disasters, service outages at third-party Internet providers or increased government regulation.\n\u2022Delays in our ability to deliver our products and services electronically may harm our reputation and result in the loss of customers. In addition, a number of our customers entrust us with storing and securing their data and information on our servers.\n\u2022Although we have disaster recovery plans that include backup facilities for our primary data centers, our systems are not always fully redundant, and our disaster planning may not always be sufficient or effective. As such, these disruptions may affect our ability to store, handle and secure such data and information.\nOur operations and infrastructure may malfunction or fail, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\u2022Our ability to conduct business may be materially and adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which we are located, including New York City, the location of our headquarters, and major cities worldwide in which we have offices.\n\u2022This may include a disruption involving physical or technological infrastructure used by us or third parties with or through whom we conduct business, whether due to human error, natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, acts of terrorism, political unrest, war or otherwise. Our efforts to secure and plan for potential disruptions of our major operating systems may not be successful.\n\u2022We rely on our information technology environment and certain critical databases, systems and applications to support key product and service offerings. We believe we have appropriate policies, processes and internal controls to ensure the stability of our information technology, provide security from unauthorized access to our systems and maintain business continuity, but our business could be subject to significant disruption and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by unanticipated system failures, data corruption or unauthorized access to our systems.\n\u2022We also do not have fully redundant systems for most of our smaller office locations and low-risk systems, and our disaster recovery plan does not include restoration of non-essential services. If a disruption occurs in one of our locations or systems and our personnel in those locations or those who rely on such systems are unable to utilize other\nsystems or communicate with or travel to other locations, such persons\u2019 ability to service and interact with our clients and customers may suffer.\n\u2022We cannot predict with certainty all of the adverse effects that could result from our failure, or the failure of a third party, to efficiently address and resolve these delays and interruptions. A disruption to our operations or infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nInability to attract and retain key qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\u2022The development, maintenance and support of our products and services are dependent upon the knowledge, experience and ability of our highly skilled, educated and trained employees. Accordingly, our business is dependent on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees. If the Company is less successful in its recruiting efforts, or if it is unable to retain key employees, its ability to develop and deliver successful products and services or achieve strategic goals may be adversely affected.\nOur reputation, credibility, and brand are key assets and competitive advantages of our Company and our business may be affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace.\n\u2022Our reputation, credibility, and the strength of our brand are key competitive strengths.\n\u2022Given our role in the financial and commodities markets, our ability to attract and retain customers is uniquely affected by external perceptions of our reputation, credibility, and brand.\n\u2022Negative perceptions or publicity could damage our reputation with customers, prospects, regulators, and the public generally, which could negatively impact, among other things, our ability to attract and retain customers, employees and suppliers, as well as suitable candidates for acquisition or other combinations.\n\u2022Damage to our reputation, credibility, and brand could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur expansion into and investments in new markets may not be successful.\n\u2022We believe there remains significant opportunity to expand our business into major geographic and product markets (including China and ESG, respectively), and we are in the process of such expansion efforts. Expansion into new markets requires significant levels of investment and attention from management. There can be no assurance that these markets will develop as anticipated or that we will have success in these markets, and if we do not, we may be unable to recover our investment spent to expand our business into these markets and may forgo opportunities in more lucrative markets, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to multiple risks associated with the global nature of our operations.\n\u2022The geographic breadth of our activities subjects us to significant legal, economic, operational, market, compliance and reputational risks. These include, among others, risks relating to:\n\u25aaeconomic and political conditions around the world,\n\u25aainflation,\n\u25aafluctuation in interest rates and currency exchange rates,\n\u25aalimitations that foreign governments may impose on the conversion of currency or the payment of dividends or other remittances to us from our non-U.S. subsidiaries,\n\u25aadiffering accounting principles and standards,\n\u25aaincreases in taxes or changes in U.S. or foreign tax laws, including the possible increase in the U.S. corporate income tax rate and other changes in tax policy proposed by the Biden administration,\n\u25aapotential costs and difficulties in complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations (including tax systems) administered by foreign government agencies, some of which may conflict with U.S. or other sources of law,\n\u25aachanges in applicable laws and regulatory requirements,\n\u25aathe possibility of nationalization, expropriation, price controls and other restrictive governmental actions,\n\u25aacompetition with local rating agencies that have greater familiarity, longer operating histories and/or support from local governments or other institutions, and\n\u25aacivil unrest, protests, terrorism, unstable governments and legal systems, and other factors.\nAdverse developments in any of these areas could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\u2022Additionally, we are subject to complex U.S., European and other local laws and regulations that are applicable to our operations abroad, including trade sanctions laws, anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act 2010, anti-money laundering laws, and other financial crimes laws. Our internal controls, policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs related to these topics may not be effective in preventing employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies and violating applicable laws and regulations. A determination that we have violated such laws could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\u2022Compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases the cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. Violations of such laws and regulations may result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, administrative remedies, or restrictions on business conduct and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\u2022Embargoes and sanctions laws are changing rapidly for certain geographies, including with respect to Russia, Iran, and Venezuela. These embargoes and sanctions laws may affect our ability to continue to market and/or sell our products and services into these geographies. In addition, while we have a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of import and export laws and sanctions, violations of these laws or sanctions could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 17478, "SIC": 7323, "TIC": "SPGI"}
