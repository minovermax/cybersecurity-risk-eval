{"cik": "1425565", "company": "Real Goods Solar, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nWe wish to caution you that there are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those indicated by forward looking statements that we make from time to time in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, news releases, reports, proxy statements, registration statements and other written communications, as well as oral forward looking statements made from time to time by our representatives. These risks and uncertainties include those risks described below of which we are presently aware. Historical results are not necessarily an indication of the future results. Cautionary statements below discuss important factors that could cause our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows to be materially adversely affected.\nRisk Factors Related to our Business and Industry\nWe have a history of operating losses, and it is uncertain when, or if, we may be able to achieve or sustain future profitability. If we do not become profitable on an ongoing basis, we may be unable to continue our operations.\nWe have incurred net losses and have an accumulated deficit of $183 million as of December 31, 2016. If we cannot improve our operating results and ultimately generate net income, we may be unable to continue our operations in the future.\nWe need to increase our sales, installations and revenue in order to achieve our goal of initially operating at break-even, and profitability thereafter.\nOur current levels of sales, installations and revenue are insufficient for profitable operations. We have developed plans, to be implemented during 2017, to increase sales and installation revenue. We believe that the recently obtained additional financial resources allow us to begin to implement our plans. If we are unsuccessful in executing these plans, we will be unable to increase sales, installations and resulting revenue and will not achieve our goal of operating at break-even, and profitability thereafter.\nWe need to grow our backlog or we will be unable to increase revenue.\nWe did not have access to financial capital to implement our revenue growth strategy until the fourth quarter of 2016. As a result, our backlog and sales headcount each decreased during 2016. To grow our backlog, we need to hire and train new salespersons, and bid upon and be awarded new customer sales. While we implement our revenue growth strategy, and until we build a larger backlog, our installation revenue will fluctuate by quarter. If we are unsuccessful in building a larger backlog, we will be unable to increase sales, installations and resulting revenue and we will not achieve our goal of operating at break-even and achieving profitability thereafter.\nWe have a history of negative cash flows from operations, and it is uncertain when, or if, in the future we will be able to achieve or sustain positive cash flow from operations.\nThere can be no assurance in the future that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, future financings or other sources to fund operations or other liquidity needs which could have important adverse consequences to us, such as:\n\u00b7 limiting our ability to obtain additional financing;\n\u00b7 making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to future indebtedness;\n\u00b7 limiting our ability to respond to changing business, industry and economic conditions and to withstand competitive pressures, which may affect our financial condition;\n\u00b7 limiting our ability to make investments, dispose of assets, pay cash dividends or repurchase stock;\n\u00b7 increasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business, our industry or the general economy and restricting us from making improvements or acquisitions or exploring business opportunities; and\n\u00b7 placing us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors with greater resources\nOur future operating performance and our ability to service indebtedness will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nOur future indebtedness may impose restrictive covenants on us.\nWe currently are not party to any loan agreement providing for a revolving credit facility or term loan, but have been in the recent past. However, if we in the future enter into a loan agreement, our future indebtedness may impose various customary covenants on us and our subsidiaries. The restrictions imposed under these debt instruments may include, among other obligations, limitations on our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to:\n\u00b7 sell assets;\n\u00b7 change our business, management or ownership;\n\u00b7 engage in any merger, acquisition or consolidation transactions;\n\u00b7 incur additional debt or sell additional securities;\n\u00b7 make dividends or distributions and repurchase stock;\n\u00b7 make investments;\n\u00b7 enter into certain transactions with affiliates; and\n\u00b7 make payments on or amend any subordinated obligations\nOur ability to comply with the covenants imposed by the terms of future indebtedness may be affected by general economic conditions, industry conditions, and other events beyond our control. As a result, we cannot assure you that we would be able to comply with these covenants. Our failure to comply with such covenants, including failure to comply as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.\nIf there were an event of default under future indebtedness, the holders of the defaulted debt would likely be able to cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable, subject to applicable grace periods. We cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to repay borrowings under applicable indebtedness if accelerated upon an event of default, or that we would be able to repay, refinance or restructure the payments on such indebtedness.\nExisting rules, regulations and policies pertaining to electricity pricing and technical interconnection of customer-owned electricity generation and changes to these regulations and policies may deter the purchase and use of solar energy systems and negatively impact development of the solar energy industry.\nThe market for solar energy systems is heavily influenced by foreign, federal, state and local government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry, as well as policies adopted by electric utilities. These regulations and policies often relate to electricity pricing and technical interconnection of customer-owned electricity generation. For example, the vast majority of states have a regulatory policy known as net energy metering, or \u201cnet metering\u201d, which allows our customers to interconnect their on-site solar energy systems to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchases by receiving a bill credit at the utility\u2019s retail rate for energy generated by their solar energy system that is exported to the grid and not consumed on-site. In this way, the customer pays for the net energy used or receives a credit at the retail rate if more electricity is produced than consumed. In some states, net metering is being replaced with lower credits for the excess electricity sent onto the grid from solar energy systems, and utilities are imposing minimum or fixed monthly charges on owners of solar energy systems. For example, in October, 2015, the Hawaiian Electric Companies, the primary utility in Hawaii, announced that it was replacing its net metering program with a new \u201cgrid supply\u201d program that credits excess electricity sent onto the grid by a solar energy system at a fixed rate of between 15 cents per kilowatt-hour and 27 cents per kilowatt hour, rather than at the higher retail rates available under the prior net-metering program and also imposes a minimum monthly bill of $25 dollars for owners of solar energy systems that remain connected to the utility grid. Many jurisdictions also impose caps which limit the aggregate amount of power that may be sold by solar power generators into the electric grid. Some utilities also restrict the amount of consumer-owned electricity generation that can be placed on a circuit and may require special studies or equipment before such generation can be connected to the utility grid. These regulations and policies have been modified in the past and may be modified in the future in ways that can restrict the interconnection of solar energy systems and deter purchases of solar energy systems by customers. In addition, electricity generated by solar energy systems competes most favorably in markets with tiered rate structures or peak hour pricing that increase the price of electricity when more is consumed. Modifications to these rate structures by utilities, such as reducing peak hour or tiered pricing or adopting flat rate pricing, could require the price of solar energy systems to be reduced in order to compete with the price of utility generated electricity.\nThe reduction, elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for solar energy systems could reduce the demand for our products and services.\nU.S. federal, state and local government bodies and utilities provide incentives to end-users, distributors, system integrators and manufacturers of solar energy systems to promote solar electricity in the form of rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives such as system performance payments and payments for renewable energy credits associated with renewable energy generation. These incentives enable us to lower the price we charge our customers for solar energy systems. However, these incentives may expire on a particular date, end when the allocated funding is exhausted, or be reduced or terminated as solar energy adoption rates increase. These reductions or terminations often occur without warning. In addition, applicable authorities may adjust or decrease incentives from time to time or include provisions for minimum domestic content requirements or other requirements to qualify for these incentives. The reduction, elimination or expiration of such incentives or delays or interruptions in the implementation of favorable federal or state laws could substantially increase the cost of our systems to our customers, resulting in a significant reduction in demand for our solar energy systems, which would negatively impact our business. For example, The Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources recently announced that the total capacity available under its current SREC program (SREC-II) for projects over 25 kW had been exceeded in early 2016, however it was announced on January 31, 2017 by the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources that their new program, SMART, is targeted to start in January 2018 and that the SREC II program would be extended in order to bridge between the two programs. Massachusetts accounted for a significant amount of our sales in 2016, and had the program not been extended, our sales in Massachusetts would have likely declined significantly.\nWe prepare and submit paperwork on behalf of our customers and financing partners to obtain payment for solar energy systems that we sell and applicable incentives. The failure to complete this paperwork accurately or submit it on a timely basis may reduce our revenue and profit on projects and expose us to liquidated damages and other penalties.\nWe typically prepare and submit the necessary paperwork on behalf of our customers and financing companies to obtain payment for solar energy systems that we sell and applicable incentive payments. The processing of such paperwork is generally subject to rigid and formal compliance procedures. In addition, such processing may be time consuming and add significant cost and administrative burden. We may price our products assuming that we will obtain payments that depend on the timely and accurate processing of such paperwork. There can be no assurance that we will be able to process necessary paperwork in a timely and accurate manner and successfully obtain all payments available to us or to our customers. If we are unsuccessful in doing so, our revenue and profit margin will be negatively impacted and we may have to pay financial penalties or liquidated damages.\nOur business prospects could be harmed if solar energy is not widely adopted or sufficient demand for solar energy systems does not develop or takes longer to develop than we anticipate.\nThe solar energy market is at a relatively early stage of development. The extent to which solar energy will be widely adopted and the extent to which demand for solar energy systems will increase are uncertain. If solar energy does not achieve widespread adoption or demand for solar energy systems fails to develop sufficiently, we may be unable to achieve our revenue and profit targets. In addition, demand for solar energy systems in our targeted markets may not develop or may develop to a lesser extent or more slowly than we anticipate. Many factors may affect the demand for solar energy systems, including the following:\n\u00b7 availability of government and utility company subsidies and incentives to support the development of the solar energy industry;\n\u00b7 government and utility policies regarding the interconnection of solar energy systems to the utility grid;\n\u00b7 fluctuations in economic and market conditions that affect the viability of conventional and non-solar renewable energy sources, such as changes in the price of natural gas and other fossil fuels;\n\u00b7 cost-effectiveness (including the cost of solar panels), performance and reliability of solar energy systems compared with conventional and other non-solar renewable energy sources and products;\n\u00b7 success of other renewable energy generation technologies, such as hydroelectric, wind, geothermal, solar thermal, concentrated solar and biomass;\n\u00b7 availability of financing with economically attractive terms;\n\u00b7 fluctuations in expenditures by purchasers of solar energy systems, which tend to decrease in slower economic environments and periods of rising interest rates and tighter credit; and\n\u00b7 deregulation of the electric power industry and the broader energy industry.\nA drop in the retail price of conventional electricity or non-solar renewable energy sources may negatively impact our business.\nThe demand for our solar energy systems depends in part on the price of conventional electricity, which affects return on investment resulting from the purchase of solar energy systems. Fluctuations in economic and market conditions that impact the prices of conventional and non-solar renewable energy sources could cause the demand for solar energy systems to decline, which would have a negative impact on our business.\nExisting regulations, and changes to such regulations, may present technical, regulatory and economic barriers to the installation of solar energy systems, which may significantly reduce demand for our solar energy systems.\nThe installation of solar energy systems is subject to oversight and regulation under local ordinances; building, zoning and fire codes; environmental protection regulation; utility interconnection requirements for metering; and other rules and regulations. We attempt to keep up-to-date on these requirements on a national, state and local level and must design and install our solar energy systems to comply with varying standards. Certain jurisdictions may have ordinances that prevent or increase the cost of installation of our solar energy systems. In addition, new government regulations or utility policies pertaining to the installation of solar energy systems are unpredictable and may result in significant additional expenses or delays, which could cause a significant reduction in demand for solar energy systems.\nFor installation projects where we recognize revenue on a percentage-of-completion basis or payments are due upon the achievement of contractual milestones, any delay or cancellation of a project could adversely affect our business.\nFor projects where we recognize revenue on a percentage-of-completion basis our revenue from these installations is determined by the performance of our contractual obligations. The time it takes to execute our contractual obligations may impact the amount of revenue recognized in a particular period. Timelines can be adversely impacted by weather, governmental agencies, utilities and customer requirements. In addition, certain customer contracts may include payment milestones due at specified points during a project. Although we generally have payment terms that provide for positive cash flow, delays in project execution or customer payments can adversely affect our business and cash flows.\nOur sales and installations are subject to seasonality of customer demand and weather conditions which are outside of our control.\nOur sales are subject to the seasonality of when customers buy solar energy systems. We experience spikes in orders during the spring and summer months which, due to lead time, result in installations and revenue increasing during the summer and fall. Tax incentives can generate additional backlog prior to the end of the year, depending upon the incentives available and whether customers are looking to take advantage of such incentives before the end of the year.\nOur ability to construct systems outdoors may be impacted by inclement weather, which can be most prominent in our geographic installation regions during the first and fourth quarters of the year. As a result of these factors, our first quarter is generally our slowest quarter of the year. If unexpected natural events occur and we are unable to manage our cash flow through these seasonal factors, there could be a negative impact on our financial position, liquidity, results of operations and cash flow.\nOur inability to respond to changing technologies and issues presented by new technologies could harm our business.\nThe solar energy industry is subject to technological change. If we rely on products and technologies that cease to be attractive to customers, or if we are unable to respond appropriately to changing technologies and changes in product function or quality, we may not be successful in capturing or retaining significant market share. In addition, any new technologies utilized in our solar energy systems may not perform as expected or as desired, in which event our adoption of such products or technologies may harm our business.\nWe derive the majority of the revenue from the sale of solar energy systems in east coast states, Hawaii and California.\nWe currently derive the vast majority of our revenue from the sale of solar energy systems in east coast states, California and Hawaii. This geographic concentration exposes us to increased risks associated with the growth rates, government regulations, economic conditions, weather and other factors that may be specific to those states to which we would be less subject if we were more geographically diversified. The growth of our business will require us to expand our operations in existing markets and to commence operations in other states. Any geographic expansion efforts that we may make may not be successful, which would limit our growth opportunities.\nOur operations are largely dependent on the skill and experience of our management and key personnel. The loss of management and other key personnel or our inability to hire additional personnel could significantly harm our business and our ability to expand, and we may not be able to effectively replace members of management who have left the company.\nOur continued success and our ability to maintain our competitive position is largely dependent upon, among other things, the efforts and skills of our senior executives and management team. We cannot guarantee that these individuals will remain with us. We do not carry key man life insurance on our executives. If we lose the services of any members of our management team or other key personnel, our business may be significantly impaired. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our existing senior executive and management personnel or attract additional qualified senior executive and management personnel.\nWe may incur fines and other penalties if we do not conduct our business in accordance with licenses required for our operations and if any such license is suspended or lost, we may be unable to sell or install solar energy systems in the jurisdiction in question and our sales and revenue from that jurisdiction would be adversely affected.\nAs a construction company we are required to hold general or specialty contractors\u2019 licenses in some of the jurisdictions in which we operate, although in other jurisdictions we are permitted to utilize the licenses of subcontractors. Some jurisdictions also require licenses to sell home improvement products or services, or to issue consumer credit. If we violate the rules of these licensing authorities, we may incur fines or other penalties or have our licenses suspended or cancelled. Some licenses require us to employ personnel with specific qualifications. If we lose those personnel, we may lose our ability to conduct business in that jurisdiction until we can hire a qualified replacement.\nThe loss of personnel or failure to hire additional personnel could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and our ability to expand.\nThe expansion of our business could significantly strain our managerial, financial and personnel resources. To reach our goals, we must successfully recruit, train, motivate and retain additional employees, including management and technical personnel, integrate new employees into our overall operations and enhance our financial and accounting systems, controls and reporting systems. While we believe we have personnel sufficient for the current requirements of our business, expansion of our business could require us to employ additional personnel. The loss of personnel or our failure to hire additional personnel could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and our ability to expand.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to litigation which, if adversely determined, could cause us to incur substantial losses.\nFrom time to time during the normal course of operating our businesses, we are subject to various litigation claims and legal disputes. As a result, we might also be required to incur significant legal fees, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position. In addition, because we cannot accurately predict the outcome of any action, it is possible that, as a result of current and/or future litigation, we will be subject to adverse judgments or settlements that could significantly reduce our earnings or result in losses.\nWe may be subject to unexpected warranty expenses or service claims that could reduce our profits.\nAs a result of the length of the warranty periods we provide both in workmanship and, in certain cases, in energy production, we bear the risk of warranty claims long after we have completed the installation of a solar energy system. Our current standard warranty for our installation services includes a warranty period of up to 10 years for defects in material and workmanship. In addition, most manufacturers of solar photovoltaic modules offer a 25-year warranty period for declines in power performance. Although we maintain an estimated liability for potential warranty or service claims, claims in excess of our recorded liability could adversely affect our operating results. Our failure to predict accurately future warranty claims could result in unexpected volatility in our financial results.\nWe have a dispute with a customer of our former Commercial segment, the ultimate resolution of which could have a material impact upon our results of operations and financial position.\nAs previously disclosed, and as discussed in Item 3 of Part I, we have a dispute with a customer of our former Commercial segment wherein the customer alleges that we have not completed agreed-upon remedial work to remedy alleged deficiencies, and has notified us that the customer intends to perform such work at our expense using a third-party contractor. In addition, the customer demanded an aggregate of approximately $400,000 as liquidated damages under the terms of the project contract. We estimate that the range of loss related to this warranty claim is from approximately $200,000 to a maximum of approximately $1 million. If we have to compensate the customer for its remedial work or pay the customer liquidated damages, it would negatively impact our results of operations and result in a significant use of cash.\nThe ultimate resolution of our dispute with our insurance carrier could result in the significant outlay of cash.\nAs previously disclosed, we have incurred legal expenses of $1.5 million in connection with a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into our July 2014 private placement. The investigation was ultimately closed without action by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and we and our legal advisors believe the legal expenses incurred in connection with the investigation should be fully paid by our insurance carrier. Our insurance carrier has paid these legal expenses but informed us that if it concludes that such expenses do not constitute a \u201cclaim\u201d covered by the policy, they would seek to recoup all amounts advanced. As such, we have recorded the advanced funds as a deferred liability. If our insurance carrier were to pursue reimbursement and prevailed in recouping the amounts advanced, it would not affect results of operations but would result in a significant use of cash.\nWe rely heavily on a limited number of suppliers, installers and other vendors, and if these companies were unable to deliver critical components and services, it would adversely affect our ability to operate and our financial results.\nWe rely on a limited number of third-party suppliers to provide the components used in our solar energy systems. We also rely on key vendors to provide internal and external services which are critical to our operations, including installation of solar energy systems, accounting and customer relationship management software, facilities and communications. The failure of our suppliers and vendors to supply us with products and services in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms could result in lost orders, delay our project schedules, limit our ability to operate and harm our financial results. If any of our suppliers or vendors were to fail to supply our needs on a timely basis or to cease providing us key components or services we use, we would be required to secure alternative sources of supply. We may have difficulty securing alternative sources of supply. If this were to occur, our business would be harmed.\nAlthough currently there is no shortage of supplies for solar energy systems, from time to time in the past, shortages have occurred and have impacted solar companies such as us. Shortages in the supply of silicon and inverters or supply chain issues could adversely affect the availability and cost of the solar photovoltaic modules used in our solar energy systems.\nShortages of silicon and inverters or supply chain issues could adversely affect the availability and cost of our solar energy systems. Manufacturers of photovoltaic modules depend upon the availability and pricing of silicon, one of the primary materials used in photovoltaic modules. The worldwide market for silicon from time to time experiences a shortage of supply, which can cause the prices for photovoltaic modules to increase and supplies to become difficult to obtain. While we have been able to obtain sufficient supplies of solar photovoltaic modules to satisfy our needs to date, this may not be the case in the future. Future increases in the price of silicon or other materials and components could result in an increase in costs to us, price increases to our customers or reduced margins.\nA significant percentage of photovoltaic modules used in the United States are imported from China or utilize solar cells made in Taiwan. In 2014 the U.S. Department of Commerce imposed tariffs on these products. Although most of the solar photovoltaic modules we used in 2015 were sourced from North American manufacturers, we have experienced price increases and occasional problems with availability as a result of these tariffs. Other international trade conditions such as work slowdowns and labor strikes at port facilities or major weather events can also adversely impact the availability and price of solar photovoltaic modules.\nWe install solar energy systems, and many factors can prevent us from completing installations on time or on budget.\nFactors that may prevent us from completing installations on time or on budget include:\n\u00b7 shortages of materials;\n\u00b7 shortages of skilled labor;\n\u00b7 unforeseen installation scheduling, engineering, excavation, environmental or geological problems;\n\u00b7 job site issues that were not apparent during site inspection\n\u00b7 natural disasters, hurricanes, weather interference, fires, earthquakes or other casualty losses or delays;\n\u00b7 delays in obtaining or inability to obtain or maintain necessary licenses or permits;\n\u00b7 changes to plans or specifications;\n\u00b7 performance by subcontractors;\n\u00b7 disputes with subcontractors; and\n\u00b7 unanticipated cost increases in materials, labor or other elements of our projects beyond budgets and allowances for contingencies.\nOur installation projects expose us to risks of cost overruns due to typical uncertainties associated with any project or changes in the designs, plans or concepts of such projects. For these and other reasons, installation costs may exceed the estimated cost of completions.\nBecause the solar energy system installation market is highly competitive and has low barriers to entry, we may face the loss of business or reduced margins.\nThe solar energy system installation market is highly competitive with low barriers to entry. We currently compete with significantly larger companies as well as a large number of relatively small installers and developers. Larger companies may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources and greater name recognition than we do. Smaller companies may lack adequate systems and capital, but can benefit from operating efficiencies or from having lower overhead, which enables them to offer lower prices.\nWe believe that our ability to compete depends in part on a number of factors outside of our control, including the following:\n\u00b7 the availability of solar financing solutions;\n\u00b7 the price at which competitors offer comparable products;\n\u00b7 marketing efforts undertaken by our competitors;\n\u00b7 the extent of our competitors\u2019 responsiveness to customer needs; and\n\u00b7 access to materials, labor and installation services.\nCompetition in the solar energy system installation market may increase in the future as a result of low barriers to entry. Increased industry competition could result in reductions in price, margins, and market share and in greater competition for qualified personnel. Our business and operating results would be adversely affected if we are unable to compete effectively.\nThe installation and ongoing operation of solar energy systems involves significant safety risks.\nSolar energy systems generate electricity, which is inherently dangerous. Installation of these systems also involves the risk of falling from rooftops, personal injuries occurring at the job site and other risks typical of construction projects. Although we take many steps to assure the safe installation and operation of our solar energy systems, and maintain insurance against such liabilities, we may nevertheless be exposed to significant losses arising from personal injuries or property damage arising from our projects.\nAvailability and cost of financing for solar energy systems could reduce demand for our services and products.\nMany of our customers depend on loan or lease financing to fund the purchase price of our solar energy systems. The interest rate for this financing varies with market conditions. Third-party financing sources may also charge significant fees for their financing products. If our financing sources increase their fees or interest rates, our customers\u2019 cost of purchasing our solar energy systems will increase and we may experience decreased demand for our products and services, resulting in reduced revenue. In the alternative, if we elect to absorb any financing price increase by lowering the price of our products and services to keep the total cost to our customers constant, our revenue will decrease and we will experience lower profit margins. However, we continue to rely on third parties to finance most of our sales of solar energy systems.\nAn increase in interest rates or tight credit markets could make it difficult for customers to finance the cost of solar energy systems and could reduce demand for our services and products.\nSome of our prospective customers may depend on debt financing, such as home equity loans or leasing, to fund the purchase of a solar energy system. Third-party financing sources, specifically for solar energy systems, are currently limited. The lack of financing sources, limitations on available credit, or an increase in interest rates could make it difficult or more costly for our potential customers to secure the financing necessary to purchase a solar energy system on favorable terms, or at all, thus lowering demand for our services and products and negatively impacting our business.\nOur failure to meet customer expectations in the performance of our services, and the risks and liabilities associated with placing our employees and technicians in our customers\u2019 homes and businesses, could give rise to claims against us.\nOur failure or inability to meet customer expectations in the performance of our services could damage our reputation or result in claims against us. In addition, we are subject to various risks and liabilities associated with our employees and technicians providing installation services in the homes and businesses of our customers, including possible claims of errors and omissions, harassment, theft of customer property, criminal activity and other claims.\nProduct liability claims against us could result in adverse publicity and potentially significant monetary damages.\nAs a seller of consumer products, we may face product liability claims in the event that use of our solar energy systems results in injuries. Because solar energy systems produce electricity, it is possible that our products could result in injury, whether by product malfunctions, defects, improper installation or other causes. If such injuries or claims of injuries were to occur, we could incur monetary damages and our business could be adversely affected by any resulting negative publicity. The successful assertion of product liability claims against us also could result in potentially significant monetary damages and, if our insurance protection is inadequate to cover these claims, could require us to make significant payments from our own resources.\nWe rely on technology, computer systems, third-party service providers, and our website for obtaining and storing certain information.\nOur business requires us to receive, retain and transmit personally identifiable information and other information about our customers, suppliers and employees, some of which is entrusted to third-party service providers and other businesses we interact with. Our security measures have been breached in an immaterial manner in the past and may be breached in the future due to a cyber-attack, computer malware or viruses, employee error, malfeasance, fraudulent inducement (including so-called \u201csocial engineering\u201d attacks and \u201cphishing\u201d scams) or other acts. Costs associated with our past security breach have not been significant. Unauthorized parties have previously obtained and may in the future obtain access to our data or the data of our customers, suppliers or employees or may otherwise cause damage or interfere with our technology, computer systems or website. We develop and update processes and maintain systems in an effort to try to prevent this from occurring and seek assurances from businesses we interact with that they will do the same, but the development and maintenance of these processes and systems are costly and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change, privacy and information security regulations change, and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. We have taken, and continue to undertake significant steps to protect such information and seek assurances from businesses we interact with that they will do the same, but there can be no assurance that our data security systems or those of businesses we interact with will not be compromised, and such compromise could result in such information being obtained by unauthorized persons, adverse operational effects or interruptions, substantial additional costs or being subject to legal or regulatory proceedings, any of which could damage our reputation in the marketplace or materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nIn the event the make-up of our board of directors or audit committee were not, or are not in the future, in compliance with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Nasdaq Capital Market independence requirements, we face a number of risks that could materially and adversely affect our shareholders and our business.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission rules and the Nasdaq Capital Market\u2019s continued listing requirements require, among other things, that a majority of the members of our board of directors are independent and that our audit committee consists entirely of independent directors. In the event that we do not remain in compliance with these requirements, our executive officers could establish policies and enter into transactions without the requisite independent review and approval. This could present the potential for a conflict of interest between us and our shareholders generally and our executive officers, shareholders, or directors.\nFurther, our failure to comply with these requirements may limit the quality of the decisions that are made by our board of directors and audit committee, increasing the risk of material misstatements or omissions caused by errors or fraud with respect to our financial statements or other disclosures that may occur and not be detected in a timely manner or at all, or the payment of inappropriate levels of compensation to our executive officers. In the event that there are deficiencies or weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we may misreport our financial results or lose significant amounts due to misstatements caused by errors or fraud. Finally, if the composition of our board of directors or audit committee fails to meet Nasdaq\u2019s independence requirements in the future, our Class A common stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nRisk Factors Related to Our Securities\nThe market price of our Class A common stock has been volatile, and future volatility could result in substantial losses for investors.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock has been volatile in the past and could fluctuate widely in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated changes in our operating results;\n\u00b7 regulatory, legislative or other developments affecting us or the solar energy industry generally;\n\u00b7 changes in expectations relating to our services and products, plans and strategic position or those of our competitors or customers;\n\u00b7 market conditions and trends within the solar energy industry;\n\u00b7 acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or by our competitors;\n\u00b7 litigation involving us, our industry or both;\n\u00b7 introductions of new technological innovations, services, products or pricing policies by us or by our competitors;\n\u00b7 recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u00b7 our ability to execute our business plan;\n\u00b7 volume and timing of customer orders;\n\u00b7 price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n\u00b7 changes in investor perception;\n\u00b7 the level and quality of any research analyst coverage of our Class A common stock;\n\u00b7 changes in earnings estimates or investment recommendations by analysts;\n\u00b7 the financial guidance we may provide to the public, any changes in such guidance or its failure to meet such guidance;\n\u00b7 the trading volume of our Class A common stock;\n\u00b7 our issuance of additional Class A common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for Class A common stock; and\n\u00b7 economic and other external factors that impact purchasing decisions of our potential customers.\nFuture volatility of the market price of our Class A common stock could result in substantial losses for investors.\nFuture issuances of our stock, options, warrants or other securities will cause substantial dilution and may negatively affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nOwnership of our securities may be diluted by future issuances of securities or the conversion or exercise of outstanding or to be issued options, warrants, convertible notes, convertible stock or other securities.\nAs of March 6, 2017, there were an aggregate of approximately 6.5 million shares of our Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding warrants. The exercise price under certain of our outstanding warrants is subject to reset in the future. For example, the exercise price of our Series I warrants is subject to a reset. If the exercise price in effect on April 1, 2017 is higher than the lowest daily volume weighted average price (as defined in our Series I warrants) of our Class A common stock on any trading day during the month of March 2017, the exercise price is reset to such lower price, but in no event lower than $0.10. Further, the exercise price of our Series H warrants is subject to reset at the earlier to occur of (a) the repayment in full of our Senior Secured Convertible Notes due April 1, 2019 (the \u201cNotes\u201d), and (b) the maturity date of the Notes. If on such date the exercise price of our Series H warrants exceeds 85% of the lowest volume weighted average price of our Class A common stock for the five trading days ending on, but including, the adjustment date, the exercise price will be reset to such lower price.\nDerivative securities, such as convertible debt, options and warrants, currently outstanding or issued in the future may contain anti-dilution protection provisions, which, if triggered, could require us to issue a larger number of the security underlying such derivative security than the face amount. For example, the warrants we issued in the June 3, 2013 private placement provide that among other things, if we issue or sell, or are deemed to have issued and sold, shares of Class A common stock for a consideration per share less than a price equal to the exercise price of the warrants, the exercise price of the warrants will be reduced and the number of shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants will be increased, based on the formula and on the terms set forth in the warrants.\nWe cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales or issuance of shares of our Class A common stock into the market, or the availability of shares of our Class A common stock for future sale, will have on the market price of our Class A common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock (including shares issued upon exercise of options and warrants or conversion of convertible related party debt), or the perception that such sales could occur, may materially affect prevailing market prices for our Class A common stock.\nWe do not expect to pay any cash dividends on our Class A common stock for the foreseeable future.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our Class A common stock for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, investors in our securities would have to sell some or all of their stock in order to generate cash flow from their investment. Any determination to pay dividends in the future on our Class A common stock will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our results of operations, financial conditions, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law, capital requirements and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant.\nOur business is subject to reporting requirements that continue to evolve and change, which could continue to require significant compliance effort and resources.\nBecause our Class A common stock is publicly traded, we are subject to certain rules and regulations of federal, state and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded. These entities, including the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Nasdaq Stock Market, periodically issue new requirements and regulations and legislative bodies also review and revise applicable laws such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. As interpretation and implementation of these laws and rules and promulgation of new regulations continues, we will continue to be required to commit significant financial and managerial resources and incur additional expenses.\nProvisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or change in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nOur articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our Class A common stock by discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control of our company or changes in our management that our shareholders may believe advantageous. These provisions include:\n\u00b7 Our board of directors may consist of any number of directors, which may be fixed from time to time by our board of directors. Newly created directorships resulting from any increase in our authorized number of directors may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office or by an election at an annual meeting or special meeting of shareholders called for that purpose, and any vacancies on its board of directors resulting from death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office or other cause may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining board of directors, even if less than a quorum is remaining in office.\n\u00b7 A shareholder must provide advance notice of any proposal to be brought before an annual meeting of shareholders by a shareholder, including any nomination for election of directors by any shareholder entitled to vote for the election of directors at the meeting.\n\u00b7 No shareholder proposal may be considered at a meeting of our shareholders unless the proposal relates to a matter on which a shareholder vote is required by our articles of incorporation, bylaws or by applicable law.\n\u00b7 Our board of directors has the power to issue preferred stock with designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights determined by our board of directors without any vote or action by shareholders. The issuance of preferred stock or of rights to purchase preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire our company, or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire our company.\n\u00b7 Our board of directors may amend, supplement or repeal our bylaws or adopt new bylaws, subject to repeal or change by action of our shareholders.\nThe terms of our outstanding warrants to purchase Class A common stock and securities purchase agreement entered into with investors participating in our past offerings could impede our ability to enter into certain transactions or obtain additional financing.\nThe terms of our Notes and some of our outstanding series of warrants to purchase Class A common stock prohibit us from entering into a \u201cfundamental transaction\u201d (as defined in the Notes and such warrants) (including generally, a merger, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or permitting a purchase tender or exchange offering resulting in a person or group of persons owning at least 50% of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock) unless the successor resulting from the fundamental transaction assumes all of our obligations under the Notes and the warrants and the associated transaction documents, and, if a successor is publicly-traded, at a holder\u2019s request, such successor issues substantially similar substitute securities.\nIn addition, the securities purchase agreements we entered into in connection with our offering of Class A common stock and warrants closed February 6, 2017 and February 9, 2017 prohibit us from offering, selling, granting any option to purchase or otherwise dispose of, or being part of any solicitations, negotiations or discussions with regard to, any of our or our subsidiaries\u2019 equity securities or equity equivalent securities until May 7, 2017 and May 10, 2017, respectively. These covenants will restrict our ability to enter into certain fundamental transactions or obtain additional financing in the future without a waiver.\nThe terms of our outstanding warrants to purchase Class A common stock could result in our paying premiums or penalties to the holders of or outstanding warrants.\nOur outstanding warrants require us to deliver the number of shares of our Class A common stock issuable upon exercise within a specified time period. If we are unable to deliver the shares of Class A common stock within the timeframe required, we may be obligated to reimburse the holder for the cost of purchasing the shares of our Class A common stock in the open market or pay them the profit they would have realized upon the conversion or exercise and sale of such shares. The payments we may be obligated to make to the holders of our outstanding warrants may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe must meet The Nasdaq Capital Market continued listing requirements or we risk delisting, which may decrease the per share price of our Class A common stock and make it harder for our shareholders to trade our stock.\nOur Class A common stock is currently listed for trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market. We must continue to satisfy Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing requirements or risk delisting of our securities.\nAs previously disclosed, we are currently subject to a \u201cPanel Monitor\u201d through January 15, 2018. We have failed to comply with the Nasdaq Capital Market continued listing requirements in the past and there can be no assurance that we will continue to satisfy Nasdaq\u2019s minimum shareholders\u2019 equity requirement or any other applicable listing requirement during the monitoring period or thereafter.\nIf our Class A common stock is delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market, it may trade on the over-the-counter market, which may be a less liquid market. In such case, our shareholders\u2019 ability to trade, or obtain quotations of the market value of, shares of our Class A common stock would be severely limited because of lower trading volumes and transaction delays. These factors could contribute to lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for our securities.\nIn addition to the foregoing, if our Class A common stock is delisted from Nasdaq and it trades on the over-the-counter market, the application of the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock and increase the transaction costs to sell those shares. The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted regulations which generally define a \u201cpenny stock\u201d as an equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to specific exemptions. The last reported trade of our Company Stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market was at a price below $5.00 per share. If our Class A common stock is delisted from Nasdaq and it trades on the over-the-counter market at a price of less than $5.00 per share, our Class A common stock would be considered a penny stock. The Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, before a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer must also provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and the salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer\u2019s account. In addition, the penny stock rules generally require that before a transaction in a penny stock occurs, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s agreement to the transaction. If applicable in the future, these rules may restrict the ability of brokers-dealers to sell our Class A common stock and may affect the ability of investors to sell their shares, until our Class A common stock no longer is considered a penny stock.", "PERMNO": 92687, "SIC": 3690, "TIC": "RGSEQ"}
