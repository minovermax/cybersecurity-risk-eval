{"cik": "1747009", "company": "Equitrans Midstream Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered in evaluating the Company's business and future prospects. The following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important for understanding any statement in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or elsewhere. The following information should be read in conjunction with \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation\" and the financial statements and accompanying notes included in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" Note that additional risks not presently known to us or that are currently considered immaterial may also have a negative impact on our business and operations. If any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs, the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to pay dividends could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other variables affecting the Company's results of operations, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nRisks Related to an Investment in Us\nOur only cash-generating assets are our ownership interests in EQM, and our cash flow is therefore completely dependent upon the ability of EQM to make quarterly cash distributions to its partners, including us.\nThe amount of cash we have available for dividends depends primarily on EQM's cash flow and not solely on EQM's profitability, which is affected by non-cash items. As a result, EQM may make cash distributions during periods when EQM records a loss for financial reporting purposes and may not make cash distributions during periods when EQM records net earnings for financial reporting purposes.\nThe amount of cash that EQM can distribute each quarter to its partners, including us, principally depends upon the amount of cash EQM generates from its operations, which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe rates EQM charges for EQM's gathering, transmission, storage and water services;\n\u2022\nthe level of firm gathering, transmission and storage capacity sold and volumes of natural gas EQM gathers, transports and stores for its customers;\n\u2022\nthe volume of water delivered to its customers and the cost of water;\n\u2022\nregional, domestic and foreign supply and perceptions of supply of natural gas; the level of demand and perceptions of demand in EQM's end-use markets; and actual and anticipated future prices of natural gas and other commodities (and the volatility thereof), which may affect EQM's ability to renew and replace firm gathering, transmission and storage agreements;\n\u2022\nthe effect of seasonal variations in temperature on the amount of natural gas that EQM gathers, transports and stores;\n\u2022\nthe level of competition from other midstream energy companies in EQM's geographic markets;\n\u2022\nthe creditworthiness of EQM's customers;\n\u2022\nrestrictions contained in EQM's joint venture agreements;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of distributions received by EQM under its joint venture agreements;\n\u2022\nthe level of EQM's operating, maintenance and general and administrative costs;\n\u2022\ncosts of alternative fuel sources;\n\u2022\nregulatory action affecting the supply of, or demand for, natural gas, the rates EQM can charge on its assets, how EQM contracts for services, EQM's existing contracts, EQM's operating costs and EQM's operating flexibility; and\n\u2022\nprevailing market conditions.\nIn addition, the actual amount of cash EQM will have available for distribution will depend on other factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe level and timing of capital expenditures and capital contributions EQM makes;\n\u2022\nthe level of EQM's operating and maintenance and general and administrative expenses;\n\u2022\nthe ability of EQM to successfully identify and consummate joint ventures and other transactions, including strategic acquisitions, if any, and to successfully integrate those acquisitions into EQM's business;\n\u2022\nEQM's debt service requirements and other liabilities;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in EQM's working capital needs;\n\u2022\nEQM's ability to borrow funds and access capital markets on satisfactory terms;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on distributions contained in EQM's debt agreements;\n\u2022\nthe amount of EQM's cash reserves; and\n\u2022\nother business risks affecting EQM's cash levels.\nBecause of these factors, EQM may not have sufficient available cash (as defined in EQM's partnership agreement) each quarter to pay quarterly distributions at its most recently announced fourth quarter 2018 distribution amount of $1.13 per unit or any other amount. The amount of cash that EQM has available for distribution depends primarily upon its cash flow, including cash flow from operations and working capital borrowings, and is not solely a function of profitability, which will be affected by non-cash items. As a result, EQM may be able to make cash distributions when it records losses for financial accounting purposes and may not be able to make cash distributions during periods when it records net income for financial accounting purposes. Please read \"Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to EQM's Business\" for a discussion on risks affecting EQM's ability to generate cash flow.\nThe tax treatment of EQM depends on its status as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as well as it not being subject to a material amount of entity-level taxation by individual states. If the IRS were to treat EQM as a corporation or if EQM becomes subject to additional amounts of entity-level taxation for state or foreign tax purposes, it would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to us.\nWe own, directly or indirectly, a 1.2% general partner interest, all of the IDRs and a 30.6% limited partner interest in EQM. Following the completion of the EQM IDR Transaction, we expect to own, directly or indirectly, a 59.9% limited partner interest in EQM, which we expect will consist of 117,245,455 EQM common units and 7 million Class B units. Accordingly, the value of our investment in EQM, as well as the anticipated after-tax economic benefit of an investment in our shares, depends largely on EQM being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, which requires that 90% or more of EQM's gross income for every taxable year consist of qualifying income, as defined in Section 7704 of the Code.\nDespite the fact that EQM is a limited partnership under Delaware law and has not elected to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, it is possible, under certain circumstances, for EQM to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes. A change in EQM's business could cause EQM to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject EQM to federal income taxation as an entity. For example, EQM would be treated as a corporation if less than 90% of EQM's gross income for any taxable year consists of \"qualifying income\" within the meaning of Section 7704 of the Code.\nIf EQM was treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, EQM would pay federal income tax on its taxable income at the corporate tax rate, which is currently 21% and would likely pay state income taxes at varying rates. Distributions to EQM's partners (including us) would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions, and no income, gains, losses or deductions would flow through to EQM's partners. Because a tax would be imposed upon EQM as a corporation, its cash available for distribution would be substantially reduced. Therefore, treatment of EQM as a corporation would result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after-tax return to us, likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of our shares.\nCurrent law may change, causing EQM to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or otherwise subjecting EQM to entity-level taxation. In addition, several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity-level taxation through the imposition of state income, franchise and other forms of taxation. Imposition of any entity-level taxes on EQM will reduce its cash available for distribution to its partners.\nEQM's partnership agreement provides that if a law is enacted or existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that subjects EQM to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects EQM to entity-level taxation for federal income tax purposes, EQM's minimum quarterly distribution and target distribution amounts will be adjusted to reflect the impact of that law on EQM. If this were to happen, the amount of distributions we receive from EQM and our resulting cash flows could be reduced substantially, which would adversely affect our ability to pay dividends.\nThe tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships such as EQM could be subject to potential legislative, judicial, or administrative changes and differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis.\nThe present U.S. federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships, including EQM, may be modified by legislative, judicial, or administrative changes, or interpretations of applicable law at any time. Any modifications to the U.S. federal income tax laws that may be applied retroactively or prospectively could make it more difficult or impossible to meet the expectation of future cash distributions or reduce the cash available for dividends to our shareholders. For example, from time to time, members of the U.S. Congress propose and consider such substantive changes to the existing federal income tax laws that affect publicly traded partnerships. If enacted, the proposals could eliminate the qualifying income exception to the treatment of all publicly traded partnerships as corporations upon which EQM relies for its treatment as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We are unable to predict whether any of these changes or other proposals will ultimately be enacted, but it is possible that a change in law could affect EQM and may, if enacted, be applied retroactively. Any such changes could negatively impact the value of our direct or indirect investments in EQM, and therefore our shares.\nIf the IRS makes audit adjustments to EQM's income tax returns for tax years beginning after 2017, the IRS (and some states) may assess and collect any resulting taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) directly from EQM, in which case EQM may require its unitholders (including us) and potentially former unitholders to reimburse EQM for such payment or, if EQM is required to bear such payment, EQM's cash available for distribution to its unitholders (including us) might be substantially reduced.\nPursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, if the IRS makes audit adjustments to EQM's income tax return for tax years beginning after 2017, the IRS (and some states) may assess and collect any resulting taxes (including any applicable interest and penalties) directly from EQM. EQM will have a limited ability to shift any such tax liability to its general partner and\nunitholders, including us, in accordance with their interests in EQM during the year under audit, but there can be no assurance that EQM will be able to (or will choose to) do so under all circumstances, or that EQM will be able to (or choose to) effect corresponding shifts in state income or similar tax liability resulting from the IRS adjustment in states in which EQM does business in the year under audit or in the adjustment year. If EQM makes payments of taxes, penalties and interest resulting from audit adjustments, EQM may require its unitholders, including us, and potentially former unitholders to reimburse it for such payment or, if EQM is required to bear such payment, EQM's cash available for distribution to its unitholders, including us, might be substantially reduced. Additionally, EQM may be required to allocate an adjustment disproportionately among its unitholders, causing its publicly traded units to have different capital accounts, which could negatively impact the value of our investment in EQM, unless the IRS issues further guidance.\nIn the event the IRS makes an audit adjustment to EQM's income tax returns and EQM does not or cannot shift the liability to its unitholders in accordance with their interests in EQM during the year under audit, EQM will generally have the ability to request that the IRS reduce the determined underpayment by reducing the suspended passive loss carryovers of EQM's unitholders (without any compensation from EQM to such unitholders), to the extent such underpayment is attributable to a net decrease in passive activity losses allocable to certain partners. Such reduction, if approved by the IRS, will be binding on any affected unitholders.\nIf in the future we cease to manage and control EQM, we may be deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940.\nIf we cease to manage and control EQM, and as a result we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the Investment Company Act), we will either have to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, obtain exemptive relief from the SEC or modify our organizational structure or our contractual rights to fall outside the definition of an investment company. Registering as an investment company could, among other things, materially limit our ability to engage in transactions with affiliates, including the purchase and sale of certain securities or other property to or from our affiliates, restrict our ability to borrow funds or engage in other transactions involving leverage, require us to add additional directors who are independent of us and our affiliates, and adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nEQM may issue additional limited partner interests or other equity securities, which may increase the risk that EQM will not have sufficient available cash to maintain or increase its cash distribution level.\nEQM has wide latitude to issue additional limited partner interests on the terms and conditions established by its general partner. The value of our stock price has a correlation to the value of the EQM limited partner interests that we hold. Additional EQM limited partner interest issuances will have a dilutive effect on EQM's earnings per unit, which could adversely affect the market price of EQM's common unit price. If EQM were to issue additional limited partnership interests it would have a dilutive effect on our economic interests in EQM.\nThe credit and risk profile of EQM could adversely affect our credit ratings and risk profile, which could increase our borrowing costs or hinder our ability to raise capital.\nThe credit and business risk profiles of EQM may be factors considered in credit evaluations of us. This is because our only cash-generating assets are our ownership interests in EQM, and our cash flow is therefore completely dependent upon the ability of EQM to make quarterly cash distributions to its partners, including us. Due to our relationship with EQM, our ability to access the capital markets, or the pricing or other terms of any capital markets transactions, may be adversely affected by any impairments to EQM's financial condition, including the degree of its financial leverage or adverse changes in its credit ratings. Any material limitations on our ability to access capital as a result of adverse changes at EQM could limit our ability to obtain future financing under favorable terms, or at all, or could result in increased financing costs in the future. Similarly, material adverse changes at EQM could negatively impact our share price, limiting our ability to raise capital through equity issuances or debt financing, could negatively affect our ability to engage in, expand or pursue our business activities, and could also prevent us from engaging in certain transactions that might otherwise be considered beneficial to us.\nIf EQM's unitholders remove the EQM General Partner, we would lose our general partner interest and our ability to manage EQM.\nWe currently manage EQM through the EQM General Partner, our wholly-owned subsidiary and the general partner of EQM. EQM's partnership agreement, however, gives unitholders of EQM the right to remove the EQM General Partner upon the affirmative vote of holders of 66 2\u20443% of EQM's outstanding units. If the EQM General Partner were to be removed as general partner of EQM, we would lose our ability to manage EQM. If we lose our ability to manage EQM, the successor general partner of EQM may change EQM's operations in a manner that could have a material impact on EQM's financial condition, liquidity and results of operations and may also reduce distributions to EQM's unitholders, all of which could have a material\nimpact on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. A reduction in EQM's distributions will adversely affect the amount of cash distributions we receive and our ability to declare dividends to our shareholders.\nOur ability to sell our partnership interests in EQM may be limited by securities law restrictions and liquidity constraints.\nWe beneficially own 37,245,455 EQM common units, representing a 30.6% limited partner interest in EQM, all of which are unregistered and restricted securities, within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act). Unless we exercise our registration rights with respect to these common units, we will be limited in our ability to sell our EQM common units in the public market.\nOur stock price may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of our common stock may decline or fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our or EQM's operating results;\n\u2022\nflat or slow growth in the production of natural gas in EQM's areas of operation;\n\u2022\ndeclining operating revenues derived from EQM's core business;\n\u2022\nany further delays to the MVP in-service date or further MVP cost increases;\n\u2022\nthe gain or loss of significant customers;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nthe operating and stock price performance of companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u2022\nchanges in the regulatory and legal environment under which we operate;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions in the oil-and-gas industry and domestic and worldwide economy as a whole;\n\u2022\nchanges in recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nnews reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the energy, gas and water industries;\n\u2022\nnew technology used, or services offered, by competitors;\n\u2022\nperceptions in the marketplace regarding us, our competitors, and/or our customers;\n\u2022\nsignificant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nfailure to identify or integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions, business combinations, strategic partnerships or joint ventures;\n\u2022\nchanges in our, EQM's or EQT's credit ratings;\n\u2022\nadditional investments from third parties; and\n\u2022\nissuance of additional shares of our common stock.\nGeneral market fluctuations, industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events, such as economic slowdowns or recessions, could also cause our stock price to decrease regardless of operating results.\nOur stock price may be adversely affected by dispositions of our common stock by significant shareholders, including EQT.\nFollowing the Distribution, EQT retained 19.9% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. EQT publicly disclosed that it currently plans to dispose of all of our common stock that it retained after the Distribution, which may include dispositions through one or more subsequent exchanges for debt or a sale of such shares for cash as soon as practical following the Distribution consistent with the business reasons for the retention of those shares, but in no event later than five years after the Distribution. We agreed that, upon the request of EQT, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to effect a registration under applicable U.S. federal and state securities laws of any shares of our common stock retained by EQT. See \"Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions and Director Independence.\" Any disposition by EQT, or any\nsignificant shareholder, of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such dispositions could occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nOur ability to meet our financial needs may be adversely affected by our lack of operational assets.\nOur only cash-generating assets are partnership interests in EQM, and we currently have no independent operations separate from those of EQM. A reduction in EQM's distributions will affect the amount of cash distributions we receive and the amount of cash we will be able to distribute to our shareholders. Given that our only cash-generating assets are partnership interests in EQM, we may not have enough cash to meet our needs if any of the following events occur:\n\u2022\nan increase in our operating expenses;\n\u2022\nan increase in our general and administrative expenses;\n\u2022\nan increase in our working capital requirements; or\n\u2022\nan increase in the cash needs of EQM or its subsidiaries that reduces EQM's distributions.\nAdditionally, we may over time reduce our partnership interests in EQM, which would have the effect of reducing EQM's cash distributions to us.\nOur indebtedness, and restrictions under the agreements governing our indebtedness, could adversely affect our operating flexibility, business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nOur level of debt could have important consequences to us, including the following:\n\u2022\nOur ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired, or such financing may not be available on favorable terms;\n\u2022\nOur funds available for operations, future business opportunities and dividends to shareholders will be reduced by that portion of our cash flow required to service our debt;\n\u2022\nWe may be more vulnerable to competitive pressures or a downturn in our business or the economy generally; and\n\u2022\nOur flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions may be limited.\nOur ability to service our debt will depend principally on receiving distributions from EQM which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond our or EQM's control. See \"- Risks Related to EQM's Business.\"\nIn addition, our debt agreements contain, and future debt agreements may contain, various covenants and restrictive provisions that could limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional debt;\n\u2022\nmake distributions on or redeem or repurchase common stock;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments;\n\u2022\nincur or permit liens on assets;\n\u2022\nenter into certain types of transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nenter into certain mergers or acquisitions; and\n\u2022\ndispose of certain of our assets.\nOur $100 million revolving credit facility and our $600 million term loan credit facility each contain a covenant (that is suspended during the continuance of either the Company or the term loans under the term loan facility obtaining and maintaining an investment grade rating from two of Moody's Investors Service (Moody's), Standard & Poor's Ratings Service (S&P) and Fitch Ratings Service (Fitch), in each case with a stable or better outlook) requiring us to maintain a debt service coverage ratio of not more than 1.10 to 1.00. Our $100 million revolving credit facility contains a covenant requiring us to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of not more than 3.50 to 1.00. Our $600 million term loan credit facility contains a covenant (that is suspended during the continuance of either the Company or the term loans under the term loan facility\nobtaining and maintaining an investment grade rating from two of Moody's, S&P and Fitch, in each case with a stable or better outlook) requiring us to make quarterly prepayments based on a variable percentage of excess cash flow, ranging from 50% to 0% depending on the Company's consolidated net leverage ratio. None of these covenants are currently suspended. Our ability to comply with restrictions and covenants may be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot assure our shareholders that we will comply with these covenants. In addition, our $100 million revolving credit facility and our $600 million term loan credit facility contain events of defaults customary for such facilities, including the occurrence of a change of control.\nThe provisions of our debt agreements may affect our ability to obtain future financing and pursue attractive business opportunities and our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in business conditions. In addition, a failure to comply with the provisions of our debt agreements could result in an event of default, which could enable our lenders to, subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable agreement, declare any outstanding principal of such debt, together with accrued and unpaid interest, to be immediately due and payable. Our debt agreements also contain a cross default provision that applies to any other indebtedness we may have exceeding an aggregate principal amount of $25 million. Our only cash-generating assets are our ownership interests in EQM and if the payment of our debt is accelerated, our assets may be insufficient to repay such debt in full, and our shareholders could experience a partial or total loss of their investments.\nIn addition, our indebtedness or our subsidiaries' indebtedness may be viewed negatively by credit rating agencies, which could result in increased costs for us to access the capital markets. Any future downgrade of the debt issued by us or our subsidiaries could significantly increase our capital costs or adversely affect our ability to raise capital in the future.\nWe cannot guarantee the timing, amount or payment of dividends on our common stock.\nAlthough we expect to pay regular cash dividends, the timing, declaration, amount and payment of future dividends to shareholders will fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors (the Board). The Board's decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors, such as our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, any debt service obligations and covenants associated with such debt service obligations, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors that the Board deems relevant. Because our only source of operating cash flow consists of cash distributions from EQM, the amount of dividends we are able to pay to our shareholders may fluctuate based on the level of distributions EQM makes to its partners, including us. We cannot assure you that EQM will continue to make quarterly cash distributions at its most recently announced fourth quarter 2018 distribution amount of $1.13 per unit or any other amount or increase its quarterly distributions in the future. In addition, while we would expect to increase or decrease dividends to our shareholders if EQM were to increase or decrease distributions to unitholders, the timing and amount of such changes in dividends, if any, would not necessarily be comparable to the timing and amount of any changes in distributions made by EQM to us. Various factors, such as reserves established by the Board of Directors of the EQM General Partner, may affect the distributions EQM makes to its unitholders, including us. In addition, prior to making any distributions to its unitholders, EQM will reimburse the EQM General Partner and its affiliates for all direct and indirect expenses incurred by us and certain of our affiliates on its behalf. The EQM General Partner will determine the amount of these reimbursed expenses. The reimbursement of these expenses could adversely affect the amount of distributions EQM makes to its unitholders, including us.\nYour percentage of ownership in us may be diluted in the future.\nYour percentage ownership in us may be diluted because of equity awards that we grant to our directors, officers and employees or otherwise as a result of equity issuances for acquisitions or capital market transactions. Our Management Development and Compensation Committee has authority to grant share-based awards to our employees under our employee benefit plans. Such awards will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. From time to time, we will issue share-based awards to our employees under our employee benefits plans.\nIn addition, our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation authorize us to issue, without the approval of our shareholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock that have such designations, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our Board generally may determine.\nThe terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. As discussed under \"- The Board has adopted a shareholder rights agreement, which could delay or discourage a merger, tender offer, or assumption of control of the Company not approved by the Board,\" on November 13, 2018, our Board declared a dividend of one Right (as defined below) for each outstanding share of our common stock and adopted the Rights Plan (as defined below). If issued, the Preferred Stock (as defined below) issuable upon the exercise of the Rights will have a dilutive effect on the voting power and could reduce the value of our common stock.\nSimilarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws, as well as provisions of Pennsylvania law, could impair an attempt to acquire us.\nOur Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of us deemed undesirable by our Board. These include provisions:\n\u2022\nrequiring the vote of the holders of not less than 80% of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock for the approval of certain transactions;\n\u2022\nrequiring the vote of the holders of not less than 80% of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock to amend our articles of incorporation and bylaws, under certain circumstances;\n\u2022\nauthorizing blank check preferred stock, which we could issue with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to those of our common stock;\n\u2022\nlimiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;\n\u2022\nspecifying that our shareholders may take action only at a duly called annual or special meeting of shareholders and otherwise in accordance with our bylaws and prohibiting our shareholders from calling special meetings;\n\u2022\nrequiring advance notice of proposals by our shareholders for business to be conducted at shareholder meetings and for nominations of candidates for election to our Board; and\n\u2022\ncontrolling the procedures for conduct of our Board and shareholder meetings and election, appointment and removal of our directors.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could deter or delay hostile takeovers, proxy contests and changes in control or management of us. As a Pennsylvania corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Pennsylvania law, including certain provisions of Chapter 25 of the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law (PBCL), which prevents some shareholders from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock.\nAny provision of our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation or Amended and Restated Bylaws or Pennsylvania law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control of us could limit the opportunity for our shareholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and also could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nThe Board has adopted a shareholder rights agreement, which could delay or discourage a merger, tender offer, or assumption of control of the Company not approved by the Board.\nOn November 13, 2018, the Board declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (Right) for each outstanding share of Equitrans Midstream common stock and adopted a shareholder rights plan as set forth in the rights agreement (the Rights Agreement), dated as of November 13, 2018, by and between Equitrans Midstream and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, as rights agent. The dividend was paid on November 23, 2018 to Equitrans Midstream shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 23, 2018.\nThe Rights Agreement was adopted to assist the Board in managing the period immediately following the Separation and Distribution, by protecting against creeping accumulations or other share acquisition activity that the Board believes would not be in the best interest of shareholders. The Rights Agreement imposes a significant penalty upon any person or group that acquires 10% (or 15% in the case of a 13G Investor, as defined in the Rights Agreement, or 20% in the case of EQT and a single permitted transferee of the Retained Interest) or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock without the approval of the Board. The Rights Agreement should not interfere with any merger or other business combination approved by the Board. The Rights Agreement will expire on March 31, 2019, unless earlier redeemed by us.\nUpon certain triggering events, each Right would entitle the holder to purchase from us one one-hundredth (subject to adjustment) of one share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, without par value (Preferred Stock), of the Company at an exercise price of $100 (the Exercise Price) per one one-hundredth of a share of Preferred Stock. The following are the potential consequences of a person or group becoming an Acquiring Person, as defined in the Rights Agreement:\n\u2022\nFlip In. If a person or group becomes an Acquiring Person, all holders of Rights, except the Acquiring Person, may, for the Exercise Price, purchase shares of our common stock with a market value of $200, based on the market price of our common stock prior to such acquisition.\n\u2022\nExchange. After a person or group becomes an Acquiring Person, but before an Acquiring Person owns 50% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock, the Board may extinguish the Rights by exchanging one share of our common stock, or an equivalent security, for each Right other than the Rights held by the Acquiring Person.\n\u2022\nFlip Over. If the Company is later acquired in a merger or similar transaction after the date that the Rights become exercisable, all holders of Rights, except the Acquiring Person may, for the Exercise Price, purchase shares of the acquiring corporation with a market value of $200 based on the market price of the acquiring corporation's stock prior to such transaction.\nThe Rights Plan could render more difficult or discourage a merger, tender offer or assumption of control of the Company that is not approved by the Board.\nOur Amended and Restated Bylaws designate the state and federal courts sitting in the judicial district of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania embracing the county in which our registered office is located as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders, which could discourage lawsuits against us and our directors and officers.\nOur Amended and Restated Bylaws provide that, unless our Board otherwise determines, the state and federal courts sitting in the judicial district of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania embracing the county in which our registered office is located will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of us, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director or officer or other employee of ours to us or our shareholders, any action asserting a claim against us or any director or officer or other employee of us arising pursuant to any provision of the PBCL or our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation or Amended and Restated Bylaws or any action asserting a claim against us or any director or officer or other employee of ours governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our shareholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such shareholders find favorable for disputes with us or our directors or officers, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors and officers. Alternatively, if a court outside of Pennsylvania were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to execute our strategic, operational and financial plans.\nOur operations are dependent upon key management and technical personnel, and one or more of these individuals could leave our employment. The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on us. In addition, the success of our operations will depend, in part, on our ability to identify, attract, develop and retain experienced personnel. There is competition within our industry for experienced technical personnel and certain other professionals, which could increase the costs associated with identifying, attracting and retaining such personnel. If we cannot identify, attract, develop and retain our technical and professional personnel or attract additional experienced technical and professional personnel, our ability to compete could be harmed.\nCyber incidents may adversely impact our operations.\nOur business has become increasingly dependent upon digital technologies, including information systems, infrastructure and cloud applications, to operate our businesses, and the maintenance of our financial and other records has long been dependent upon such technologies. The U.S. government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of cyber security threats. Deliberate attacks on, or unintentional events affecting, our systems or infrastructure, the systems or infrastructure of third parties or the cloud could lead to corruption or loss of our proprietary data and potentially sensitive data, delays of delivery of natural gas and NGLs, difficulty in completing and settling transactions, challenges in maintaining our books and records, communication interruptions, environmental damage, personal injury, property damage and other operational disruptions, as well as damage to our reputation, financial condition and cash flows. Further, as cyber incidents continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance protective\nmeasures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents. In addition, new U.S. laws and regulations governing data privacy and the unauthorized disclosure of personal information may potentially elevate our compliance costs. Any failure by us to comply with these laws and regulations, including as a result of a cyber incident, could result in significant penalties and liability to us. Additionally, if we acquire a company that has violated or is not in compliance with applicable data protection laws, we may incur significant liabilities and penalties as a result.\nThe EQM General Partner owes duties to EQM's unitholders that may conflict with our interests, including in connection with the terms of contractual agreements, the determination of cash distributions to be made by EQM, and the determination of whether EQM should make acquisitions and on what terms, and the duties of our officers and directors may conflict with their duties as officers and/or directors of the EQM General Partner.\nConflicts of interest exist and may arise in the future as a result of the relationships between us and our affiliates, including the EQM General Partner, on the one hand, and EQM, on the other hand. For example, conflicts of interest may arise in connection with the following:\n\u2022\nthe terms and conditions of any contractual agreements between us and our affiliates, on the one hand, and EQM, on the other hand;\n\u2022\nthe determination of the amount of cash to be distributed to EQM's partners, including us, and the amount of cash to be reserved for the future conduct of EQM's business;\n\u2022\nthe determination of whether EQM should make acquisitions and on what terms;\n\u2022\nthe determination of whether EQM should use cash on hand, borrow or issue equity to raise cash to finance acquisitions, other strategic transactions or expansion capital projects, repay indebtedness, meet working capital needs, pay distributions or otherwise;\n\u2022\nany decision we make in the future to engage in business activities independent of EQM; and\n\u2022\nthe allocation of shared overhead expenses between EQM and us.\nThe directors and officers of the EQM General Partner have duties to manage EQM in a manner that is beneficial to us as the EQM General Partner's indirect owner. At the same time, the EQM General Partner, as the general partner of EQM, has a duty to manage EQM in a manner beneficial to EQM and its limited partners.\nAdditionally, our officers and directors have duties to manage our business in a manner beneficial to us and our shareholders. However, two of our directors are also directors of the EQM General Partner, and five of our officers are also officers and/or directors of the EQM General Partner, each of whom has duties to manage the businesses of EQM in a manner beneficial to EQM, and its unitholders. Consequently, these directors and officers may encounter situations in which their obligations to EQM and/or the EQM General Partner, as applicable, on the one hand, and us, on the other hand, are in conflict.\nThe Board of Directors of the EQM General Partner or its conflicts committee may resolve conflicts and has broad latitude to consider the interests of all parties to the conflict. The resolution of conflicts may not always be in our best interest or that of our shareholders.\nRisks Related to the Separation\nWe have only operated as an independent company since November 12, 2018, and our historical and pro forma financial information is not necessarily representative of the results that we would have achieved or will achieve as a separate, publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results.\nThe historical and pro forma financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for period prior to November 12, 2018, refers to our business as operated by and integrated with EQT, which was derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of EQT. Accordingly, the historical and pro forma financial information for dates prior to November 12, 2018 do not necessarily reflect the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows that we would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded company during the periods presented, or those that we will achieve in the future, primarily as a result of the factors described below:\n\u2022\nPrior to the Separation, our business was operated by EQT as part of its broader corporate organization, rather than as an independent company. EQT or one of its affiliates performed certain corporate functions for us. Our historical and pro forma financial results prior to the Separation reflect allocations of corporate expenses from EQT for such functions that are likely to be less than the expenses we will incur as a separate publicly traded company.\n\u2022\nIn the past, our working capital requirements and capital for our general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures and acquisitions, were generally satisfied as part of the corporate-wide cash management policies of EQT. As a separate company, we are responsible for obtaining our own sources of financing, which may be obtained from banks, through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities, strategic relationships or other arrangements, which may or may not be available and may be more costly.\n\u2022\nHistorically, our business was integrated with other businesses of EQT and we shared economies of scope and scale in costs, employees, vendor relationships and customer relationships with other businesses of EQT. While we have made arrangements to attempt to retain and capture the benefits that we enjoyed as a result of such integration with EQT, there is no guarantee these arrangements will continue to retain or fully capture the benefits we previously enjoyed, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\u2022\nOur cost of capital may be higher than EQT's cost of capital prior to the Separation.\n\u2022\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act) and are required to prepare our financial statements according to the rules and regulations required by the SEC. Complying with these requirements could result in significant costs to us and require us to divert substantial resources, including management time, from other activities.\nOther significant changes may occur in our cost structure, management, financing and business operations as a result of operating as a company separate from EQT. For additional information about the past financial performance of our business, see \"Item 6. Selected Financial Data\" and \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" as well as the financial statements and accompanying notes included in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nIf the Separation and Distribution, together with certain related transactions, does not continue to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we, EQT, and our respective shareholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities and, in certain circumstances, we could be required to indemnify EQT for material taxes and other related amounts pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement.\nIt was a condition to the Distribution that (i) a private letter ruling from the IRS regarding the qualification of the Distribution, together with certain related transactions, as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code and certain other U.S. federal income tax matters relating to the Separation and Distribution shall not have been revoked or modified in any material respect and (ii) EQT received an opinion from Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, in form and substance acceptable to EQT, with respect to certain tax matters relating to the qualification of the Distribution, together with certain related transactions, as a transaction described in Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code. The IRS private letter ruling is based on and relies upon and the opinion of counsel is based upon and relies on, among other things, various facts and assumptions, as well as certain representations, statements and undertakings of EQT and us, including those relating to the past and future conduct of EQT and us. If any of these representations, statements or undertakings is, or becomes, inaccurate or incomplete, or if any representations or covenants\ncontained in any of the Separation-related agreements and documents or in any documents relating to any IRS private letter ruling or opinion of counsel are breached, such IRS private letter ruling and/or opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized.\nNotwithstanding receipt of the IRS private letter ruling and opinion of counsel, the IRS could determine that the Distribution and/or certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions for U.S. federal income tax purposes if it determines that any of the representations, assumptions or undertakings upon which such IRS private letter ruling or the opinion of counsel was based are false or have been violated. In addition, the IRS private letter ruling does not address all of the issues that are relevant to determining whether the Distribution, together with certain related transactions, continues to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and the opinion of counsel represented the judgment of such counsel and is not binding on the IRS or any court and the IRS or a court may disagree with the conclusions in any opinion of counsel. Accordingly, notwithstanding receipt of an IRS private letter ruling or opinion of counsel, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not assert that the Distribution and/or certain related transactions do not qualify for the intended tax treatment or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. In the event the IRS were to prevail with such challenge we, EQT, and our respective shareholders could be subject to material U.S. federal income tax liability.\nEven if the Distribution otherwise qualifies as generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 355 and Section 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, it would result in a material U.S. federal income tax liability to EQT (but not to its shareholders) under Section 355(e) of the Code if one or more persons acquire, directly or indirectly, a 50-percent or greater interest (measured by either vote or value) in EQT's stock or in the stock of us as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the Distribution, and we may be required to indemnify EQT for any such liability under the tax matters agreement entered into by EQT and us in connection with the Distribution. Any acquisition of EQT's stock or our stock (or any predecessor or successor corporation) within two years before or after the Distribution generally would be presumed to be part of a plan that includes the Distribution, although such presumptions may be rebutted under certain circumstances. The process for determining whether an acquisition is part of a plan under these rules is complex, inherently factual in nature and subject to a comprehensive analysis of the facts and circumstances of the particular case. Notwithstanding the IRS private letter ruling and opinion of counsel described above, a sufficient change in ownership of EQT or the Company stock may occur which could result in a material tax liability to EQT.\nUnder the tax matters agreement that EQT entered into with us, we may be required to indemnify EQT against any additional taxes and related amounts resulting from (i) an acquisition of all or a portion of our equity securities or assets, whether by merger or otherwise (and regardless of whether we participated in or otherwise facilitated the acquisition), (ii) other actions or failures to act by us or (iii) any of our representations, covenants or undertakings contained in any of the Separation-related agreements and documents or in any documents relating to the IRS private letter ruling or the opinion of counsel being incorrect or violated. Any such indemnity obligations could be material. For a more detailed discussion, see \"Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions and Director Independence.\"\nWe and EQM may determine to forgo or be required to forgo certain transactions in order to avoid the risk of incurring material tax-related liabilities or indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement.\nAs a result of requirements of Section 355 of the Code and/or other applicable tax laws, we may determine to forgo certain transactions that would otherwise be advantageous. In particular, we may determine to continue to operate certain business operations for the foreseeable future even if a sale or discontinuance of such business would otherwise be advantageous. Moreover, in light of the requirements of Section 355(e) of the Code, we may determine to forgo certain transactions, including share repurchases, stock issuances, certain asset dispositions and other strategic transactions, for some period of time following the Distribution. To preserve the tax-free treatment of the Separation and the Distribution, and in addition to our indemnity obligations described above, the tax matters agreement restricts us, for the two-year period following the Distribution, except in specific circumstances, from: (i) entering into any transaction pursuant to which all or a portion of our stock would be acquired, whether by merger or otherwise, (ii) issuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds, (iii) repurchasing shares of our stock other than in certain open-market transactions, (iv) ceasing to actively conduct certain of our businesses, including, for example, ceasing to hold at least a 35% interest in each of the profit, loss and capital in EQM or (v) taking or failing to take any other action that prevents the Distribution and certain related transactions from qualifying as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code. These restrictions may limit our ability to pursue certain equity issuances, strategic transactions or other transactions that may maximize the value of our business. For more information, see \"Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions and Director Independence.\"\nCertain contingent liabilities allocated to us following the Separation may mature, resulting in material adverse impacts to our business.\nThere are several significant areas where the liabilities of EQT may become our obligations. For example, under the Code and the related rules and regulations, each corporation that was a member of the EQT consolidated U.S. federal income tax return group during a taxable period or portion of a taxable period ending on or before the effective date of the Distribution is jointly and severally liable for the U.S. federal income tax liability of the EQT consolidated U.S. federal income tax return group for that taxable period. Consequently, if EQT is unable to pay the consolidated U.S. federal income tax liability for a pre-Separation period, we could be required to pay the amount of such tax, which could be substantial and in excess of the amount allocated to us under the tax matters agreement. For a discussion of the tax matters agreement, see \"Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions and Director Independence.\" Other provisions of federal law establish similar liability for other matters, including laws governing tax-qualified pension plans, as well as other contingent liabilities.\nWe may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the Separation, and failure to realize such benefits may materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe may be unable to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the Separation, or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all. The Separation and Distribution were expected to provide the following benefits, among others:\n\u2022\nallow us to more effectively pursue and implement our own distinct operating priorities and strategies and improve board of director and management fit and focus, enabling us to pursue unique opportunities for long-term growth and profitability;\n\u2022\nallow our equity to be used as a focused acquisition currency, and as such, provide us with greater opportunities to pursue strategic investments and merger and acquisition opportunities;\n\u2022\nafford us direct access to capital markets, facilitating our ability to pursue our specific growth objectives;\n\u2022\nallow us the flexibility to develop a growth strategy that capitalizes on our distinct strengths and consequently enable us to be well-positioned to capitalize on the available opportunity set in our specific market;\n\u2022\npermit us to concentrate our financial resources solely on our own operations, providing us with greater flexibility to invest capital in our business at a time and in a manner appropriate for our distinct strategy and business needs;\n\u2022\nfacilitate a more efficient allocation of capital based on our profitability, cash flow and growth opportunities and allow us to pursue an optimal mix of return of capital to shareholders, reinvestment in leading-edge technology and value-enhancing investments and merger and acquisition and joint venture opportunities;\n\u2022\nfacilitate our access to equity capital markets by making us eligible for inclusion in certain stock indices and to debt capital markets by allowing ratings agencies to evaluate our creditworthiness on a standalone basis;\n\u2022\nfacilitate deeper understanding by investors of our business, allowing investors to more transparently value our merits, strategy, performance and future prospects, further facilitating our access to capital markets;\n\u2022\nfacilitate EQM's ability to contract with customers and suppliers, especially those that currently prefer to enter into certain commercial arrangements with pure-play midstream business rather than integrated midstream and upstream companies, thereby allowing EQM to expand and diversify its customer and supplier bases; and\n\u2022\nfacilitate incentive compensation arrangements for employees that are more directly tied to the performance of our businesses. An improved equity currency will enhance employee hiring and retention by, among other things, improving the alignment of management and employee incentives with performance and growth objectives.\nWe may not achieve these or other anticipated benefits for a variety of reasons, including, among others: (i) matters relating to the Separation continue to require significant amounts of management time and effort, which may divert management attention from operating and growing our business; (ii) as an independent company, following the Separation, we may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than if we were still a part of EQT; and (iii) following the Separation, our business is now less diversified than EQT's business prior to the Separation. If we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits expected to result from the Separation, or if such benefits are delayed, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are still incurring costs with respect to the Separation which, if significantly higher than we currently anticipate, may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe process of completing the Separation was time-consuming and involved significant costs and expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recorded approximately $73 million in non-recurring costs associated with the Separation and Distribution. These costs were related primarily to third-party consulting, legal, contractor or other fees directly associated with the Separation process. Of the total amount, the Company recorded approximately $21 million in capital expenditures related to the relocation or augmentation of corporate facilities and creation of new IT systems and approximately $52 million in expenses, including a $15 million charitable contribution to the Equitrans Midstream Foundation, a charitable organization established to continue EQT's legacy of charitable giving. Future contributions to the Equitrans Midstream Foundation, if any, will be evaluated from time to time. We may incur costs related to the Separation and Distribution after the year ended December 31, 2018 that are significantly higher than the estimated $10 million in capital expenditures and $5 million in expenses that we currently anticipate and may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For more information on the Separation, see section \"The Separation\" in \"Item 1. Business.\"\nWe or EQT may fail to perform under various transaction agreements that were executed as part of the Separation, or we may fail to have necessary systems and services in place when certain of the transaction agreements expire.\nIn connection with the Separation, we and EQT entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement as well as various other agreements, including a transition services agreement, a tax matters agreement, an employee matters agreement and a shareholder and registration rights agreement with respect to EQT's continuing ownership of our common stock. The Separation and Distribution Agreement, the tax matters agreement and the employee matters agreement determined the allocation of assets and liabilities between the companies following the Separation for those respective areas and include indemnification related to liabilities and obligations. The transition services agreement provides for the performance of select services by each company for the benefit of the other, in each case for a limited period of time after the Separation. With respect to services to be performed by EQT for the benefit of us, we are relying on EQT to satisfy its performance obligations under these agreements. If EQT is unable or unwilling to satisfy its obligations under these agreements, including its indemnification obligations, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. If we do not have in place our own systems and services, or if we do not have agreements with other providers of these services, once transaction agreements with EQT expire or terminate, we may not be able to operate our business effectively and our profitability may decline. We are in the process of creating our own, or engaging third parties to provide, systems and services to replace many of the systems and services that EQT provided to us. However, we may not be successful in implementing these systems and services, we may incur additional costs in connection with or following the implementation of these systems and services, and we may not be successful in transitioning data from EQT's systems to ours. For a description of these agreements with EQT, see \"Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions and Director Independence.\"\nCertain members of our management and directors hold stock in both EQT and us, and as a result may face actual or potential conflicts of interest.\nAlthough none of our management or directors serve at both EQT and the Company, certain of our management and directors may own both shares of common stock in EQT (EQT common stock) and our common stock. This ownership overlap could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when our management and directors and EQT management and directors face decisions that could have different implications for us and EQT. For example, potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute between us and EQT regarding the terms of the agreements governing the Distribution and our relationship with EQT following the Distribution. These agreements include the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the tax matters agreement, the employee matters agreement, the transition services agreement and any other agreements between the parties or their respective affiliates. Potential conflicts of interest may also arise out of any commercial arrangements between us or EQM, on the one hand, and EQT, on the other hand.\nFailure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could materially and adversely affect us.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act and are required to prepare our financial statements according to the rules and regulations required by the SEC. In addition, the Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports. Our failure to prepare and disclose this information in a timely manner or to otherwise comply with applicable law could subject us to penalties under federal securities laws, expose us to lawsuits and restrict our ability to access financing.\nIn addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that, among other things, we establish and maintain effective internal controls and procedures for financial reporting and disclosure purposes. To comply with this statute, beginning with the year ending\nDecember 31, 2019, we will be required to document and test our internal control procedures, our management will be required to assess and issue a report concerning our internal control over financial reporting, and our independent auditors will be required to issue an opinion on their audit of our internal control over financial reporting. Our management report on our internal controls over financial reporting and our auditors' report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting are not contained in this report due to a transition period established under SEC rules for newly public companies as discussed in \"Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.\" Internal control over financial reporting is complex and may be revised over time to adapt to changes in our business or changes in applicable accounting rules. We cannot assure you that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in the future or that a material weakness will not be discovered with respect to a prior period for which we had previously believed that internal controls were effective. If we are not able to maintain or document effective internal control over financial reporting, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be able to certify as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nMatters affecting our internal controls may cause us to be unable to report our financial information on a timely basis, or may cause us to restate previously issued financial information, and thereby subject us to adverse regulatory consequences, including sanctions or investigations by the SEC, or violations of applicable stock exchange listing rules. There could also be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in us and the reliability of our financial statements. Confidence in the reliability of our financial statements is also likely to suffer if we or our independent registered public accounting firm reports a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. This could have a material and adverse effect on us by, for example, leading to a decline in our share price or impairing our ability to raise additional capital.\nEQT may retain a significant ownership stake in us for a period of time.\nWe expect that EQT will ultimately dispose of its remaining ownership interest in us, representing 19.9% of our outstanding common stock, as soon as practicable consistent with the business reasons for the retention of such common stock, but in no event later than five years after the Distribution. There can be no assurance regarding the method by which EQT will dispose of its interest in us, as we expect it to seek to maximize overall value to its shareholders. Alternatives include one or more subsequent exchanges of such common stock for debt and a sale of such common stock for cash.\nThe disposition by EQT of its remaining ownership interest in us may be subject to various conditions, including receipt of any necessary regulatory and other approvals, the existence of satisfactory market conditions, and the confirmation of credit and financial strength ratings. These conditions may not be satisfied or EQT may decide for any other reason not to consummate the disposition and instead retain a significant ownership interest in us for a period of time, not exceeding five years. Satisfying the conditions relating to such disposition may require actions that EQT has not anticipated. Any delay by EQT in completing the disposition could have a material adverse effect on the market price for our common stock.\nPotential indemnification liabilities to EQT pursuant to agreements relating to the Separation and Distribution could materially and adversely affect us.\nThe Separation and Distribution Agreement with EQT provides for, among other things, provisions governing the relationship between us and EQT with respect to and resulting from the Separation. For a description of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, see \"Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions and Director Independence.\" Among other things, the Separation and Distribution Agreement provides for indemnification obligations designed to make us financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may exist relating to our business activities, whether incurred prior to or after the Separation, as well as those obligations of EQT assumed by us pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement. If we are required to indemnify EQT under the circumstances set forth in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, we may be subject to substantial liabilities.\nIn addition, under the tax matters agreement that we entered into with EQT, we may be required to indemnify EQT against any additional taxes and related amounts resulting from (i) an acquisition of all or a portion of our equity securities or assets, whether by merger or otherwise (and regardless of whether we participated in or otherwise facilitated the acquisition), (ii) other actions or failures to act by us or (iii) any of our representations, covenants or undertakings contained in any of the Separation-related agreements and documents or in any documents relating to the IRS private letter ruling or the opinion of counsel being incorrect or violated. Any such indemnity obligations could be material. For a more detailed discussion, see \"Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions and Director Independence.\"\nRisks Related to EQM's Business\nEQM depends on EQT for a substantial majority of its revenues and future growth. For example, EQM's water service business is directly associated with EQT's well completion activities and water needs, which are partially driven by horizontal lateral lengths and the number of completion stages per well. Therefore, EQM is subject to the business risks of EQT, and any further decrease in EQT's drilling or completion activity could adversely affect EQM's business and operating results. EQM has no control over EQT's business decisions and operations, and EQT is under no obligation to adopt a business strategy that favors EQM.\nHistorically, EQM has provided a substantial percentage of its natural gas gathering, transmission and storage and water services to EQT. EQT accounted for approximately 74% of EQM's revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018. We expect EQM to derive a substantial majority of its revenues from EQT for the foreseeable future. For example, EQM's ability to maintain water service revenues is substantially dependent on continued completion activity by EQT and other customers over time, including the volume of fresh water it distributes and produced water it handles for customers. EQM's fresh water distribution services, which make up a substantial portion of its water service revenues, will be in greatest demand in connection with completion activities. To the extent that EQT or other fresh water distribution customers complete fewer wells, or wells with shorter lateral lengths, the demand for EQM's fresh water distribution services would be reduced from that needed for more wells and longer lateral lengths. In addition, EQM's fresh water distribution business is dependent upon active development in EQM's areas of operation. In order to maintain or increase throughput levels on EQM's fresh water distribution systems, EQM must service new wells. If reductions in development activity result in EQM's inability to maintain the current levels of throughput on EQM's water services, or if reductions in lateral lengths result in a decrease in demand for EQM's water services on a per well basis, those reductions could adversely affect EQM's business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nTherefore, any event, whether in EQM's areas of operations or otherwise, that adversely affects EQT's production, financial condition, leverage, results of operations or cash flows may adversely affect us. Accordingly, we are subject to the business risks of EQT, including the following:\n\u2022\nprevailing and projected natural gas, NGLs and oil prices;\n\u2022\nthe proximity, capacity, cost and availability of gathering and transportation facilities, and other factors that result in differentials to benchmark prices;\n\u2022\nnatural gas price volatility or a sustained period of lower commodity prices may have an adverse effect on EQT's drilling operations, revenue, profitability, future rate of growth, credit worthiness and liquidity;\n\u2022\na further reduction in or slowing of EQT's anticipated drilling and production schedule, which would directly and adversely impact demand for EQM's services;\n\u2022\nthe costs of producing natural gas and the availability and costs of drilling rigs and crews and other equipment;\n\u2022\ninfrastructure capacity constraints and interruptions;\n\u2022\ngeologic considerations;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with the operation of EQT's wells and facilities, including potential environmental liabilities;\n\u2022\nthe availability and cost of capital on a satisfactory economic basis to fund EQT's operations;\n\u2022\nEQT's ability to identify exploration, development and production opportunities based on market conditions;\n\u2022\nuncertainties inherent in projecting future rates of production, levels of reserves, and demand for natural gas, NGLs and oil;\n\u2022\nEQT's ability to develop additional reserves that are economically recoverable, to optimize existing well production and to sustain production;\n\u2022\nadverse effects of governmental and environmental regulation, including the availability of drilling permits, the regulation of hydraulic fracturing, the potential removal of certain federal income tax deductions with respect to natural gas and oil exploration and development or additional state taxes on natural gas extraction, changes in tax laws and negative public perception regarding EQT's operations;\n\u2022\nthe loss of key personnel; and\n\u2022\nrisk associated with cyber security threats.\nOn January 22, 2019, EQT publicly announced a 2019 capital expenditure forecast of $1.9 billion to $2.0 billion, compared to 2018 capital expenditures of $2.4 billion. EQT may further reduce its capital spending in the future based on commodity prices or other factors. Unless EQM is successful in attracting significant new customers, its ability to maintain or increase the capacity subscribed and volumes transported under service arrangements on its gathering, transmission and storage and water systems will be dependent on receiving consistent or increasing commitments from EQT. While EQT has dedicated certain acreage to, and executed long-term firm gathering and transmission contracts on, EQM's systems, it may determine in the future that drilling in areas outside of EQM's current areas of operations is strategically more attractive to it and it is under no contractual obligation to maintain its production dedicated to EQM. Moreover, in connection with the Separation, EQT previously disclosed publicly that EQT's strategy was transitioning from one focused on volume growth to one focused on capital efficiency and free cash flow generation and that EQT was evaluating the long-term pace of development of its Upstream Business in order to achieve the optimal balance between free cash flow generation and volume growth. Based on this evaluation and as EQT publicly disclosed, EQT is currently targeting mid-single digit annual production growth over the next five years. A reduction in the capacity subscribed or volumes transported or gathered on EQM's systems by EQT could have a material adverse effect on EQM's business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nEQT may also elect to reduce its drilling activity if commodity prices decrease. Fluctuations in energy prices can also greatly affect the development of reserves. In general terms, the prices of natural gas, oil and other hydrocarbon products fluctuate in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond EQM's control. These factors include worldwide economic conditions, weather conditions and seasonal trends, the levels of domestic production and consumer demand, the levels of imported and exported natural gas, oil and LNG, the availability of transportation systems with adequate capacity, the volatility and uncertainty of regional pricing differentials, the price and availability of alternative fuels, the effect of energy conservation measures, the nature and extent of governmental regulation and taxation, and the anticipated future prices of natural gas, oil, LNG and other commodities. Declines in commodity prices could have a negative impact on EQT's development and production activity, and if sustained, could lead to a material decrease in such activity. Sustained reductions in development or production activity in EQM's areas of operation could lead to reduced utilization of EQM's services, which could adversely affect EQM's business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nDue to these and other factors, even if reserves are known to exist in areas serviced by EQM's assets, producers have chosen, and may choose in the future, not to develop those reserves.\nThe demand for the services provided by EQM's water distribution business could decline as a result of several factors.\nEQM's water service business includes fresh water distribution for use in EQM's customers' natural gas, NGLs and oil exploration and production activities. Water is an essential component of natural gas, NGLs and oil production during the drilling, and in particular, the hydraulic fracturing process. As a result, the demand for EQM's fresh water distribution and produced water handling services is tied to the level of drilling and completion activity of EQM's customers, including EQT, which is currently and anticipated to continue to be EQM's primary customer for such services. More specifically, the demand for EQM's water distribution and produced water handling services could be adversely affected by any further reduction in or slowing of EQT's or other customers' well completions, any reduction in produced water attributable to completion activity, or the extent to which EQT or other customers complete wells with shorter lateral lengths, which would lessen the volume of fresh water required for completion activity. In addition, increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in natural gas, NGLs and oil production by EQM's water service customers, which could reduce the number of wells for which EQM provides water services.\nThe availability of our water supply may be limited due to reasons including, but not limited to, prolonged drought or regulatory delays associated with infrastructure development. Restrictions on the ability to obtain water or changes in wastewater disposal requirements may incentivize water recycling efforts by oil and natural gas producers, which could decrease the demand for EQM's fresh water distribution services.\nEQM's natural gas gathering, transmission and storage services are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local regulatory authorities. Changes or additional regulatory measures adopted by such authorities could have a material adverse effect on EQM's business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make distributions.\nEQM's interstate natural gas transmission and storage operations are regulated by the FERC under the NGA, the NGPA and the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Certain portions of EQM's gathering operations are also rate-regulated by the FERC in connection with its interstate transmission operations. EQM's FERC-regulated systems operate under tariffs approved by the FERC that establish rates, cost recovery mechanisms and terms and conditions of service to its customers. Generally, the FERC's authority extends to:\n\u2022\nrates and charges for EQM's natural gas transmission and storage and FERC-regulated gathering services;\n\u2022\ncertification and construction of new interstate transmission and storage facilities;\n\u2022\nabandonment of interstate transmission and storage services and facilities;\n\u2022\nmaintenance of accounts and records;\n\u2022\nrelationships between pipelines and certain affiliates;\n\u2022\nterms and conditions of services and service contracts with customers;\n\u2022\ndepreciation and amortization policies;\n\u2022\nacquisitions and dispositions of interstate transmission and storage facilities; and\n\u2022\ninitiation and discontinuation of interstate transmission and storage services.\nInterstate pipelines may not charge rates or impose terms and conditions of service that, upon review by the FERC, are found to be unjust and unreasonable or unduly discriminatory. The recourse rate that may be charged by EQM's interstate pipeline for its transmission and storage services is established through the FERC's ratemaking process. The maximum applicable recourse rate and terms and conditions for service are set forth in EQM's FERC-approved tariffs.\nPursuant to the NGA, existing interstate transmission and storage rates and terms and conditions of service may be challenged by complaint and are subject to prospective change by the FERC. Additionally, rate increases and changes to terms and conditions of service proposed by a regulated interstate pipeline may be protested and such increases or changes can be delayed and may ultimately be rejected by the FERC. EQM currently holds authority from the FERC to charge and collect (i) \"recourse rates,\" which are the maximum rates an interstate pipeline may charge for its services under its tariff, (ii) \"discount rates,\" which are rates below the \"recourse rates\" and above a minimum level, (iii) \"negotiated rates,\" which involve rates above or below the \"recourse rates,\" provided that the affected customers are willing to agree to such rates and that the FERC has approved the negotiated rate agreement, and (iv) market-based rates for some of EQM's storage services from which EQM derives a small portion of its revenues. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 86% of the contracted firm transmission capacity on EQM's system was committed under such \"negotiated rate'' contracts, rather than recourse, discount or market rate contracts. There can be no guarantee that EQM will be allowed to continue to operate under such rate structures for the remainder of those assets' operating lives. Any successful challenge against rates charged for EQM's transmission and storage services could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nWhile the FERC does not generally regulate the rates and terms of service over facilities determined to be performing a natural gas gathering function, the FERC has traditionally regulated rates charged by interstate pipelines for gathering services performed on the pipeline's own gathering facilities when those gathering services are performed in connection with jurisdictional interstate transmission facilities. EQM maintains rates and terms of service in its tariff for unbundled gathering services performed on a portion of its gathering facilities that are connected to its transmission and storage system. Just as with rates and terms of service for transmission and storage services, EQM's rates and terms of services for its FERC-regulated gathering services may be challenged by complaint and are subject to prospective change by the FERC. Rate increases and changes to terms and conditions of service which EQM proposes for its FERC-regulated gathering services may be protested, and such increases or changes can be delayed and may ultimately be rejected by the FERC.\nThe FERC's jurisdiction extends to the certification and construction of interstate transmission and storage facilities, including, but not limited to, acquisitions, facility maintenance, expansions, and abandonment of facilities and services. While the FERC exercises jurisdiction over the rates and terms of service for EQM's FERC-regulated gathering services, these gathering facilities are not subject to the FERC's certification and construction authority. Prior to commencing construction of\nnew or existing interstate transmission and storage facilities, an interstate pipeline must obtain a certificate authorizing the construction, or file to amend its existing certificate, from the FERC. On April 19, 2018, the FERC issued a Notice of Inquiry seeking information regarding whether, and if so how, it should revise its approach under its currently effective policy statement on the certification of new natural gas transportation facilities. The formal comment period in this proceeding closed on July 25, 2018. We cannot currently predict when the FERC will issue an order in the Notice of Inquiry proceeding or what action the FERC may take in any such order. If the FERC changes its existing certificate policy, it could impact EQM's ability to construct interstate pipeline facilities. Further, typically a significant expansion project requires review by a number of governmental agencies, including state and local agencies, whose cooperation is important in completing the regulatory process on schedule. Any agency's delay in the issuance of, or refusal to issue, authorizations or permits for one or more of these projects may mean that EQM will not be able to pursue these projects or that they will be constructed in a manner or with capital requirements that EQM did not anticipate. Such delays, refusals or resulting modifications to projects could materially and negatively impact the revenues and costs expected from these projects or cause EQM to abandon planned projects.\nFERC regulations also extend to the terms and conditions set forth in agreements for transmission and storage services executed between interstate pipelines and their customers. These service agreements are required to conform, in all material respects, with the forms of service agreements set forth in the pipeline's FERC-approved tariff. Non-conforming agreements must be filed with, and accepted by, the FERC. In the event that the FERC finds that an agreement is materially non-conforming, in whole or in part, it could reject the agreement or require EQM to seek modification, or alternatively require EQM to modify its tariff so that the non-conforming provisions are generally available to all customers.\nOn March 15, 2018, the FERC issued an order prohibiting master limited partnership (MLP)-owned pipelines from including an allowance for investor income tax liability in their cost-of-service based rates. Under its prior policy, the FERC had permitted all interstate pipelines to include an income tax allowance in the cost-of-service used as the basis for calculating their regulated rates. On July 18, 2018, the FERC issued an order affirming the principal finding in the March order regarding income tax recovery and also clarifying the treatment of ADIT in light of the prohibition on MLP income tax allowances. Challenges to these orders are currently pending in a consolidated proceeding before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. On October 17, 2018, an intervenor filed a motion to hold the proceeding in abeyance. On October 24, 2018, the FERC filed a motion to dismiss the proceeding. The court has not acted on either motion at this time. We cannot currently predict when the court will act on these motions or the broader proceeding, or what actions the court may take. Also, on July 18, 2018, the FERC issued Order No. 849, adopting regulations requiring that natural gas pipelines must make a one-time report, Form 501-G, due in the fourth quarter of 2018. For MLP-owned pipelines, the Form 501-G report must calculate an earned rate of return on equity that addresses any potential over-recovery of their cost of service arising from the prohibition of the income tax allowance and the ADIT clarification. On December 28, 2018, Equitrans, L.P. filed its Form 501-G with the FERC. The FERC will evaluate these Form 501-G filings on a case-by-case basis and may open a limited or a general rate case, open an investigation, or take no further action. The FERC has initiated rate cases against at least four pipelines as a result of their respective Form 501-G filings. EQM cannot determine whether the FERC or any customer will initiate a rate case against Equitrans, L.P. as a result of its Form 501-G filing or for any other reason. Rehearing of Order No. 849 has been requested and is currently pending before the FERC. We cannot currently predict when the FERC will issue an order on rehearing in this proceeding or what action the FERC may take in any such order. This recent action by the FERC could adversely affect EQM's business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to unitholders, including us.\nThe FERC may not continue to pursue its approach of pro-competitive policies as it considers matters such as interstate pipeline rates and rules and policies that may affect rights of access to natural gas transmission capacity and transmission and storage facilities.\nSection 1(b) of the NGA exempts certain natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by the FERC under the NGA. EQM believes that its high-pressure natural gas gathering pipelines meet the traditional tests the FERC has used to establish a pipeline's status as an exempt gatherer not subject to regulation as a natural gas company, although the FERC has not made a formal determination with respect to the jurisdictional status of those facilities. However, the distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services is often the subject of litigation within the industry, so the classification and regulation of EQM's high-pressure gathering systems are subject to change based on future determinations by the FERC, the courts or the U.S. Congress.\nFailure to comply with applicable provisions of the NGA, the NGPA, federal pipeline safety laws and certain other laws, as well as with the regulations, rules, orders, restrictions and conditions associated with these laws, could result in the imposition of administrative and criminal remedies and civil penalties. For example, the FERC is authorized to impose civil penalties of up to approximately $1.2 million per violation, per day for violations of the NGA, the NGPA or the rules, regulations, restrictions, conditions and orders promulgated under those statutes. This maximum penalty authority established by statute\nwill continue to be adjusted periodically for inflation.\nIn addition, future federal, state or local legislation or regulations under which EQM will operate its natural gas gathering, transmission and storage businesses may have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nAny significant decrease in production of natural gas in EQM's areas of operation could adversely affect its business and operating results and reduce its cash available to make distributions.\nEQM's business is dependent on the continued availability of natural gas production and reserves in its areas of operation. A sustained low-price environment for natural gas or regulatory limitations could adversely affect development of additional reserves and production that is accessible by EQM's pipeline and storage assets and fresh water sources. Production from natural gas wells will naturally decline over time. The amount of natural gas reserves underlying these wells may also be less than anticipated, and the rate at which production from these reserves declines may be greater than anticipated. Additionally, producers may determine in the future that drilling activities in areas outside of EQM's current areas of operations are strategically more attractive to them due to the price environment for natural gas or other reasons. A reduction in the natural gas volumes supplied by producers could result in reduced throughput on EQM's systems and adversely impact its ability to grow its operations and increase quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us. Accordingly, to maintain or increase the contracted capacity or the volume of natural gas gathered, transported and stored on EQM's systems and cash flows associated therewith, EQM's customers must continually access additional reserves of natural gas.\nThe primary factors affecting EQM's ability to obtain non-dedicated sources of natural gas include the level of successful drilling activity near EQM's systems and EQM's ability to compete for volumes from successful new wells. While EQT has dedicated production from certain of its leased properties to EQM, EQM has no control over the level of drilling activity in its areas of operation, the amount of reserves associated with wells connected to EQM's gathering systems or the rate at which production from a well declines. In addition, EQM has no control over EQT or other producers or their drilling or production decisions, which are affected by, among other things, the availability and cost of capital, prevailing and projected energy prices, demand for hydrocarbons, levels of reserves, the producer's contractual obligations to EQM and other midstream companies, geological considerations, environmental or other governmental regulations, the availability of drilling permits, the availability of drilling rigs and crews, and other production and development costs.\nFluctuations in energy prices can also greatly affect the development of new natural gas reserves. In general terms, the prices of natural gas, oil and other hydrocarbon products fluctuate in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond EQM's control. For example, the daily spot prices for NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas ranged from a high of $7.13 per MMBtu to a low of $2.44 per MMBtu from January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2018. Factors affecting natural gas prices include worldwide economic conditions; weather conditions and seasonal trends; the levels of domestic production and consumer demand; new exploratory finds of natural gas; the availability of imported, and the ability to export, natural gas and LNG; the availability of transportation systems with adequate capacity; the volatility and uncertainty of regional basis differentials and premiums; the price and availability of alternative fuels; the effects of energy conservation measures; the nature and extent of governmental regulation and taxation; and the anticipated future prices of natural gas, oil, LNG and other commodities. Low natural gas prices, particularly in the Appalachian Basin, have had a negative impact on exploration, development and production activity and, if sustained, could lead to a material decrease in such activity. Sustained reductions in exploration or production activity in EQM's areas of operation would lead to reduced utilization of EQM's systems. Because of these factors, even if new natural gas reserves are known to exist in areas served by EQM's assets, producers may choose not to develop those reserves. Moreover, EQT may not develop the acreage it has dedicated to EQM. If reductions in drilling activity result in EQM's inability to maintain levels of contracted capacity and throughput, it could reduce EQM's revenue and impair its ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nEQM does not obtain independent evaluations of natural gas reserves connected to its systems. Accordingly, EQM does not have independent estimates of total reserves connected to its systems or the anticipated life of such reserves. If the total reserves or estimated life of the reserves connected to EQM's systems are less than EQM anticipates, or the timeline for the development of reserves is longer than EQM anticipates, and EQM is unable to secure additional sources of natural gas, there could be a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nIf new supplies of natural gas are not obtained to replace the natural decline in volumes from existing supply basins in EQM's area of operation, or if natural gas supplies are diverted to serve other markets, the overall volume of natural gas gathered, transported and stored on EQM's systems would decline, which could have a material adverse effect on EQM's business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including\nus. Additionally, see \"- EQM depends on EQT for a substantial majority of its revenues and future growth. For example, EQM's water service business is directly associated with EQT's well completion activities and water needs, which are partially driven by horizontal lateral lengths and the number of completion stages per well. Therefore, EQM is subject to the business risks of EQT, and any further decrease in EQT's drilling or completion activity could adversely affect EQM's business and operating results. EQM has no control over EQT's business decisions and operations, and EQT is under no obligation to adopt a business strategy that favors EQM.\"\nThe lack of diversification of EQM's assets and geographic locations could adversely affect its ability to make distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nEQM relies exclusively on revenues generated from its gathering, transmission and storage and water systems, which are primarily located in the Appalachian Basin in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio. Due to EQM's lack of diversification in assets and geographic location, an adverse development in these businesses or EQM's areas of operations, including adverse developments due to catastrophic events, weather, regulatory action and decreases in demand for natural gas, could have a more significant impact on EQM's results of operations and distributable cash flow to its unitholders, including us, than if EQM maintained more diverse assets and locations.\nEQM may not be able to increase its customer throughput and resulting revenue due to competition and other factors, which could limit its ability to grow.\nPart of EQM's growth strategy includes diversifying its customer base by identifying opportunities to offer services to parties other than EQT. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, EQT accounted for approximately 80%, 88% and 96%, respectively, of EQM's gathering revenues and approximately 54%, 54% and 51%, respectively, of EQM's transmission and storage revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2018 and for the period from November 13, 2017 through December 31, 2017, EQT accounted for approximately 93% and 99% of EQM's water service revenues, respectively. EQT accounted for approximately 74%, 74% and 75% of EQM's total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. EQM's ability to increase its customer-subscribed capacity and throughput and resulting revenue is subject to numerous factors beyond its control, including competition from third-party producers' existing contractual obligations to competitors and the extent to which EQM has available capacity when shippers require it. To the extent that EQM lacks available capacity on its systems for volumes, it may not be able to compete effectively with third-party systems for additional natural gas production in its areas of operation.\nEQM has historically provided gathering, transmission, storage and water services to parties other than EQT on only a limited basis and may not be able to attract material service opportunities. EQM's efforts to attract new customers may be adversely affected by EQM's desire to provide services pursuant to long-term firm contracts. EQM's potential customers may prefer to obtain services under other forms of contractual arrangements under which EQM would be required to assume direct commodity exposure. In addition, EQM must continue to improve our reputation among its potential customer base for providing high quality service to successfully attract new customers.\nThe regulatory approval process for the construction of new midstream assets is challenging, and recent decisions by regulatory and judicial authorities in pending proceedings could impact EQM's or the MVP Joint Venture's ability to obtain all approvals and authorizations necessary to complete certain projects on the projected time frame or at all or EQM's ability to achieve the expected investment return on the project.\nCertain of EQM's internal growth projects may require regulatory approval from federal, state and local authorities prior to construction, including any extensions from or additions to its transmission and storage system. The approval process for storage and transportation projects has become increasingly challenging, due in part to state and local concerns related to exploration and production, transmission and gathering activities in new production areas, including the Marcellus, Utica and Upper Devonian Shales, and negative public perception regarding the oil and gas industry, including major pipeline projects like the MVP. Such authorization may not be granted or, if granted, such authorization may include burdensome or expensive conditions.\nIn addition, any significant delays in the regulatory approval process for the MVP project could increase costs and negatively impact the scheduled in-service date of fourth quarter 2019, which in turn could adversely affect the ability for the MVP Joint Venture and its owners, including EQM, to achieve the expected investment return. The MVP project is subject to several challenges that must be resolved before the MVP project can be completed, as described in more detail in \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\"\nAlthough the MVP Joint Venture is actively defending the relevant agency actions and judicial challenges to the project, and is in active dialogue with all of the affected agencies to resolve these issues and restore the affected permits, there is no guarantee as to how long the agency proceedings and judicial challenges will take to resolve, or whether the MVP Joint\nVenture will ultimately succeed in restoring the permits in their present form or within the MVP Joint Venture's targeted time frame for placing the project in service. This and other similar litigation could adversely affect EQM's business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nEQM is exposed to the credit risk of its counterparties in the ordinary course of its business.\nEQM is exposed to the risk of loss resulting from the nonpayment and/or nonperformance of its customers, suppliers, joint venture partners and other counterparties. EQM extends credit to its customers, including EQT as its largest customer, as a normal part of EQM's business. While EQM has established credit policies, including assessing the creditworthiness of its customers as permitted by its FERC-approved natural gas tariffs, and requiring appropriate terms or credit support from them based on the results of such assessments, EQM may not have adequately assessed the creditworthiness of its existing or future customers. We cannot predict the extent to which the businesses of EQM's counterparties, including EQT, would be impacted if commodity prices decline, commodity prices are depressed for a sustained period of time, or other conditions in the energy industry were to deteriorate, nor can we estimate the impact such conditions would have on the abilities of EQM's counterparties to perform under their gathering, transmission and storage and water service agreements with EQM. The low commodity price environment has negatively impacted natural gas producers causing some producers in the industry significant economic stress including, in certain cases, to file for bankruptcy protection or to renegotiate contracts. To the extent one or more of EQM's customers is in financial distress or commences bankruptcy proceedings, contracts with these customers may be subject to renegotiation or rejection under applicable provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code. Any resulting nonpayment and/or nonperformance by EQM's counterparties could have a material adverse effect on EQM's business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nIncreased competition from other companies that provide gathering, transmission and storage, and water services, or from alternative fuel sources, could have a negative impact on the demand for EQM's services, which could adversely affect its financial results.\nEQM's ability to renew or replace existing contracts at rates sufficient to maintain current revenues and cash flows could be adversely affected by the activities of its competitors. EQM's systems compete primarily with other interstate and intrastate pipelines and storage facilities in the gathering, transmission and storage of natural gas. Some of EQM's competitors have greater financial resources and may now, or in the future, have access to greater supplies of natural gas or water than EQM does. Some of these competitors may expand or construct gathering systems, transmission and storage systems and water systems that would create additional competition for the services EQM provides to its customers. In addition, EQM's customers may develop their own gathering, transmission or storage, or water services instead of using EQM's. Moreover, we are not limited in our ability to compete with EQM.\nThe policies of the FERC promoting competition in natural gas markets are having the effect of increasing the natural gas transmission and storage options for EQM's traditional customer base. As a result, EQM could experience some \"turnback\" of firm capacity as existing agreements expire. If EQM is unable to remarket this capacity or can remarket it only at substantially discounted rates compared to previous contracts, EQM may have to bear the costs associated with the turned back capacity. Increased competition could reduce the volumes of natural gas transported or stored on EQM's system or, in cases where EQM does not have long-term firm contracts, could force EQM to lower its transmission or storage rates. Increased competition could also adversely affect demand for EQM's water services.\nFurther, natural gas as a fuel competes with other forms of energy available to end-users, including coal, liquid fuels and renewable and alternative energy. Increased demand for such forms of energy at the expense of natural gas could lead to a reduction in demand for natural gas gathering, transmission and storage, and water services.\nAll of these competitive pressures could make it more difficult for EQM to retain its existing customers and/or attract new customers as EQM seeks to expand its business, which could have a material adverse effect on EQM's business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us. In addition, competition could intensify the negative impact of factors that decrease demand for natural gas in the markets served by EQM's systems, such as adverse economic conditions, weather, higher fuel costs and taxes or other governmental or regulatory actions that directly or indirectly increase the cost or limit the use of natural gas.\nIf third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to EQM's pipelines and facilities become unavailable to transport or process natural gas, EQM's revenues and cash available to make distributions to its unitholders could be adversely affected.\nEQM depends on third-party pipelines and other facilities that provide receipt and delivery options to and from EQM's transmission and storage system. For example, EQM's transmission and storage system interconnects with the following\ninterstate pipelines: Texas Eastern, Dominion Transmission, Columbia Gas Transmission, Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company, Rockies Express Pipeline LLC, National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation and ET Rover Pipeline, LLC, as well as multiple distribution companies. Similarly, EQM's gathering systems have multiple delivery interconnects to multiple interstate pipelines. In the event that EQM's access to such systems was impaired, the amount of natural gas that EQM's gathering systems can gather and transport would be adversely affected, which could reduce revenues from EQM's gathering activities. Because EQM does not own these third-party pipelines or facilities, their continuing operation is not within EQM's control. If these or any other pipeline connections or facilities were to become unavailable for current or future volumes of natural gas due to repairs, damage to the facility, lack of capacity or any other reason, EQM's ability to operate efficiently and continue shipping natural gas to end markets could be restricted. Any temporary or permanent interruption at any key pipeline interconnect or facility could have a material adverse effect on EQM's business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nCertain of the services EQM provides on its transmission and storage system are subject to long-term, fixed-price \"negotiated rate\" contracts that are not subject to adjustment, even if EQM's cost to perform such services exceeds the revenues received from such contracts, and, as a result, EQM's costs could exceed its revenues received under such contracts.\nIt is possible that costs to perform services under \"negotiated rate\" contracts will exceed the negotiated rates EQM has agreed to provide to its customers. If this occurs, it could decrease the cash flow realized by EQM's systems and, therefore, the cash EQM has available for distribution to its unitholders, including us. Under FERC policy, a regulated service provider and a customer may mutually agree to a \"negotiated rate,\" and that contract must be filed with and accepted by the FERC. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 86% of the contracted firm transmission capacity on EQM's system was subscribed under such \"negotiated rate'' contracts. Unless the parties to these \"negotiated rate\" contracts agree otherwise, the contracts generally may not be adjusted to account for increased costs that could be caused by inflation or other factors relating to the specific facilities being used to perform the services.\nEQM may not be able to renew or replace expiring contracts at favorable rates or on a long-term basis.\nEQM's primary exposure to market risk occurs at the time its existing contracts expire and are subject to renegotiation and renewal. Based on total projected contractual revenues, including projected contractual revenues from future capacity expected from expansion projects that are not yet fully constructed for which EQM has executed firm contracts, EQM's firm gathering contracts and firm transmission and storage contracts had weighted average remaining terms of approximately 11 years and 15 years, respectively, as of December 31, 2018. The extension or replacement of existing contracts, including EQM's contracts with EQT, depends on a number of factors beyond EQM's control, including:\n\u2022\nthe level of existing and new competition to provide services to EQM's markets;\n\u2022\nthe macroeconomic factors affecting natural gas economics for EQM's current and potential customers;\n\u2022\nthe balance of supply and demand, on a short-term, seasonal and long-term basis, in EQM's markets;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which the customers in EQM's markets are willing to contract on a long-term basis; and\n\u2022\nthe effects of federal, state or local regulations on the contracting practices of EQM's customers.\nAny failure to extend or replace a significant portion of EQM's existing contracts, or extending or replacing them at unfavorable or lower rates, could have a material adverse effect on EQM's business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nIf the tariffs governing the services EQM provides are successfully challenged, EQM could be required to reduce its tariff rates, which could have a material adverse effect on EQM's business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nRate payers, the FERC or other interested stakeholders, such as state regulatory agencies, may challenge EQM's rates offered to individual customers or the terms and conditions of service included in EQM's tariffs. EQM does not have an agreement in place that would prohibit customers, including EQT or its affiliates, from challenging EQM's tariffs. If any challenge were successful, among other things, the rates that EQM charges on its systems could be reduced. Successful challenges could have a material adverse effect on EQM's business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us. See \"- EQM's natural gas gathering, transmission and storage services are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local regulatory authorities. Changes or additional regulatory measures adopted by such authorities could have a material adverse effect on EQM's business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make distributions.\"\nIf EQM does not complete expansion projects, its future growth may be limited.\nA significant component of EQM's growth strategy is to continue to grow the cash distributions on its units by expanding its business. EQM's ability to grow depends, in part, upon its ability to complete expansion projects, including, without limitation, the MVP, MVP Southgate and Hammerhead projects, that result in an increase in the cash EQM generates. EQM may be unable to complete successful, accretive expansion projects for many reasons, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nan inability to identify attractive expansion projects;\n\u2022\nan inability to obtain necessary rights-of-way, real estate rights or permits or other government approvals, including approvals by regulatory agencies, whether as a result of further government shutdowns or otherwise;\n\u2022\nan inability to successfully integrate the infrastructure EQM builds;\n\u2022\nan inability to raise financing for expansion projects on economically acceptable terms;\n\u2022\nincorrect assumptions about volumes, revenues and costs, including potential growth; or\n\u2022\nan inability to secure adequate customer commitments to use the newly expanded facilities.\nIn addition, EQM's ability to secure required permits and rights-of-way or otherwise proceed with construction of its expansion projects could encounter opposition from political activists, who may attempt to delay pipeline construction through protests and other means, as has recently occurred to the MVP.\nExpanding EQM's business by constructing new midstream assets subjects EQM to risks.\nOrganic and greenfield growth projects are a significant component of EQM's growth strategy. The development and construction of pipelines and storage facilities involves numerous regulatory, environmental, political and legal uncertainties beyond EQM's control and will require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital. The development and construction of pipeline infrastructure and storage facilities expose EQM to construction risks such as the failure to meet customer contractual requirements, delays caused by landowners or advocacy groups opposed to the natural gas industry, environmental hazards, adverse weather conditions, the performance of third-party contractors, the lack of available skilled labor, equipment and materials and the inability to obtain necessary rights-of-way or approvals and permits from regulatory agencies on a timely basis or at all (and maintain such rights-of-way, approvals and permits once obtained). These types of projects may not be completed on schedule, at the budgeted cost or at all. Moreover, EQM's revenues may not increase for some time after completion of a particular project. For instance, EQM will be required to pay construction costs generally as they are incurred but construction will typically occur over an extended period of time, and EQM will not receive revenues or material increases in revenues until the project is placed into service. Moreover, EQM may construct facilities to capture anticipated future growth in production and/or demand in a region in which such growth does not materialize. As a result, new facilities may not be able to attract enough throughput to achieve EQM's expected investment return, which could adversely affect EQM's business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nEQM may face opposition to the development or operation of its pipelines and facilities from various groups.\nEQM may face opposition to the development or operation of its pipelines and facilities from environmental groups, landowners, local groups and other advocates. Such opposition could take many forms, including organized protests, attempts to block or sabotage EQM's operations, intervention in regulatory or administrative proceedings involving its assets, or lawsuits or other actions designed to prevent, disrupt or delay the development or operation of its assets and business. For example, repairing EQM's pipelines often involves securing consent from individual landowners to access their property; one or more landowners may resist EQM's efforts to make needed repairs, which could lead to an interruption in the operation of the affected pipeline or other facility for a period of time that is significantly longer than would have otherwise been the case. In addition, acts of sabotage or eco-terrorism could cause significant damage or injury to people, property or the environment or lead to extended interruptions of EQM's operations. Any such event that interrupts the revenues generated by EQM's operations, or which causes it to make significant expenditures not covered by insurance, could reduce its cash available for paying distributions to its unitholders, including us, and, accordingly, adversely affect our financial condition and the market price of our securities.\nRecently, activists concerned about the potential effects of climate change have directed their attention towards sources of funding for fossil-fuel energy companies, which has resulted in certain financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital restricting or eliminating their investment in energy-related activities. Ultimately, this could make it more difficult to secure\nfunding for exploration and production activities or energy infrastructure related projects, and consequently could both indirectly affect demand for EQM's services and directly affect its ability to fund construction or other capital projects.\nAcquisitions EQM may make could reduce, rather than increase, its cash generated from operations on a per unit basis.\nIf EQM does make acquisitions that it believes will be accretive, these acquisitions may nevertheless result in a decrease in the cash generated from operations on a per unit basis. Any acquisition involves potential risks, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nmistaken assumptions about volumes, revenues and costs, including synergies and potential growth;\n\u2022\nan inability to secure adequate customer commitments to use the acquired systems or facilities;\n\u2022\nan inability to integrate successfully the assets or businesses EQM acquires;\n\u2022\nthe assumption of unknown liabilities for which EQM is not indemnified or for which EQM's indemnity is inadequate;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management's and employees' attention from other business concerns; and\n\u2022\nunforeseen difficulties operating in new geographic areas or business lines.\nIf any acquisition fails to be accretive to EQM's distributable cash flow per unit, it could have a material adverse effect on EQM's business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nReview of our goodwill has resulted in and could result in future significant impairment charges.\nGAAP requires us to perform an assessment of goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.\nWe may perform either a qualitative or quantitative assessment of potential impairment. Our qualitative assessment of potential impairment may result in the determination that a quantitative impairment analysis is not necessary. Under this elective process, we assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads us to determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, then performing a quantitative analysis is not required. However, if we conclude otherwise, then we perform a quantitative impairment analysis. If we choose not to perform a qualitative assessment, or if we choose to perform a qualitative assessment but are unable to qualitatively conclude that no impairment has occurred, then we will perform a quantitative evaluation. In the case of a quantitative assessment, we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit with which the goodwill is associated and compare it to the carrying value. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the reporting unit's carrying value over its fair value.\nAssessing the recoverability of goodwill requires significant judgments and estimates by management. Fair values of goodwill are primarily estimated using discounted cash flows based on forecasts of financial results that incorporate assumptions including, but not limited to, the discount rate, terminal value factor, peer groups, control premiums and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization multiples. All of our goodwill relates to businesses that were acquired and valued by EQT's management in the Rice Merger.\nFollowing the third quarter of 2018 and prior to the Separation, we identified impairment indicators in the form of production curtailments announced by a primary customer of the two reporting units to which our goodwill is recorded that could reduce volumetric-based fee revenues of those reporting units. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we determined that the carrying value of one of those reporting units (the RMP PA Gas Gathering reporting unit, which comprises the Pennsylvania gathering assets acquired in the Rice Merger) was greater than its fair value. As a result, we recognized impairment of goodwill of $261.9 million. If the operations or projected operating results of these businesses decline significantly, we could incur additional goodwill impairment charges. Future impairment charges could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for the period in which the impairment is recorded. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $1,239 million of goodwill, which will be monitored for future impairment. Management will continue to monitor and evaluate the factors underlying the fair market value of acquired businesses over the course of the year to determine if any interim assessments are necessary and will take any additional impairment charges required.\nEQM's failure to successfully combine and integrate the businesses of EQM and RMP may adversely affect the future results of the combined organization and EQM's ability to achieve the intended benefits of the EQM-RMP Mergers.\nThe success of the EQM-RMP Mergers depends, in part, on EQM's ability to realize the anticipated benefits from combining the businesses of EQM and RMP, and integration of the parties gathering systems remains ongoing. To realize these anticipated benefits, the businesses must be successfully combined and integrated. If the combined organization is not able to achieve these objectives, or is not able to achieve these objectives on a timely basis, the anticipated benefits of the EQM-RMP Mergers may not be realized fully or at all. In addition, the ongoing integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, which could reduce the anticipated benefits of the EQM-RMP Mergers. There can be no assurance that EQM's combination with RMP will deliver the strategic, financial and operational benefits anticipated by EQM. EQM's business may be negatively impacted if it is unable to effectively manage its expanded operations, which could have a material adverse effect on EQM's ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nIf EQM is unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms to fund expansions of its asset base or acquisitions, its ability to make quarterly cash distributions may be diminished or its financial leverage could increase. EQM does not have any commitment with the EQM General Partner or us to provide any direct or indirect financial assistance to EQM.\nIn order to expand EQM's asset base and complete announced expansion projects, including the MVP, MVP Southgate and Hammerhead projects, EQM will need to make significant expansion capital expenditures and acquisition capital expenditures. If EQM does not make sufficient or effective capital expenditures, it will be unable to expand its business operations and may be unable to maintain or raise the level of its quarterly cash distributions.\nIn order to fund its expansion capital expenditures and acquisition capital expenditures, EQM will be required to use cash from its operations, incur borrowings or sell additional common units or other partner interests. Using cash from operations will reduce distributable cash flow to EQM's common unitholders, including us. EQM's ability to obtain bank financing or to access the capital markets for future equity or debt offerings may be limited by its financial condition at the time of any such financing or offering, the covenants in EQM's debt agreements, general economic conditions and contingencies and uncertainties that are beyond EQM's control. Furthermore, market demand for equity issued by master limited partnerships has been significantly lower in recent years than it has been historically, which may make it more challenging for EQM to finance its expansion capital expenditures and acquisition capital expenditures with the issuance of equity in the capital markets. Even if EQM is successful in obtaining funds for expansion and acquisition capital expenditures through equity or debt financings, the terms thereof could limit its ability to pay distributions to its common unitholders, including us. In addition, incurring additional debt may significantly increase EQM's interest expense and financial leverage, and issuing additional partner interests may result in significant common unitholder dilution and increase the aggregate amount of cash required to maintain the then-current distribution rates, which could materially decrease EQM's ability to pay distributions at the then-current distribution rates, and our ability to pay dividends. If funding is not available to EQM when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, EQM may be unable to execute its business plans, complete acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on EQM's business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us. There is no commitment from the EQM General Partner or us to provide any direct or indirect financial assistance to EQM.\nEQM is subject to numerous hazards and operational risks.\nEQM's business operations are subject to all of the inherent hazards and risks normally incidental to the gathering, transmission and storage of natural gas and performance of water services. These operating risks include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\ndamage to pipelines, facilities, equipment, environmental controls and surrounding properties caused by hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, abnormal amounts of rainfall, floods, fires, droughts, landslides and other natural disasters and acts of sabotage and terrorism;\n\u2022\ninadvertent damage from construction, vehicles, and farm and utility equipment;\n\u2022\nuncontrolled releases of natural gas and other hydrocarbons;\n\u2022\nleaks, migrations or losses of natural gas as a result of the malfunction of equipment or facilities and, with respect to storage assets, as a result of undefined boundaries, geologic anomalies, natural pressure migration and wellbore migration;\n\u2022\nruptures, fires and explosions;\n\u2022\npipeline freeze offs due to cold weather; and\n\u2022\nother hazards that could also result in personal injury and loss of life, pollution to the environment and suspension of operations.\nThese risks could result in loss of human life, personal injuries, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of EQM's operations, regulatory investigations and penalties and substantial losses to EQM. The location of certain segments of EQM's systems in or near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase the damages resulting from these risks. In spite of any precautions taken, an event such as those described above could cause considerable harm to people, property or the environment and could have a material adverse effect on EQM's business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us. Accidents or other operating risks could further result in loss of service available to EQM's customers. Such circumstances, including those arising from maintenance and repair activities, could result in service interruptions on segments of EQM's systems. Potential customer impacts arising from service interruptions on segments of EQM's systems could include limitations on its ability to satisfy customer requirements, obligations to provide reservation charge credits to customers in times of constrained capacity, and solicitation of EQM's existing customers by others for potential new projects that would compete directly with EQM's existing services. Such circumstances could adversely impact EQM's ability to meet contractual obligations and retain customers, with a resulting negative impact on EQM's business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nNegative public perception regarding EQM, the MVP, MVP Southgate, other EQM projects and/or the midstream industry could have an adverse effect on EQM's operations.\nNegative public perception regarding EQM, the MVP, MVP Southgate, other EQM projects and/or the midstream industry resulting from, among other things, oil spills, the explosion of natural gas transmission and gathering lines, erosion and sedimentation issues, and general concerns raised by advocacy groups about hydraulic fracturing and pipeline projects, has led to, and may in the future lead to, increased regulatory scrutiny, which may, in turn, lead to new local, state and federal safety and environmental laws, regulations, guidelines and enforcement interpretations. See \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\" These actions have caused, and may continue to cause, operational delays or restrictions, increased construction and operating costs, penalties under construction contracts, additional regulatory burdens and increased risk of litigation. As discussed under \"- The regulatory approval process for the construction of new midstream assets is challenging, and recent decisions by regulatory and judicial authorities in pending proceedings could impact EQM's or the MVP Joint Venture's ability to obtain all approvals and authorizations necessary to complete certain projects on the projected time frame or at all or EQM's ability to achieve the expected investment return on the project,\" there are several pending challenges to certain aspects of the MVP project that must be resolved before the MVP project can be completed. Moreover, governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process, including through intervention in the courts. Negative public perception could cause the permits EQM and the MVP Joint Venture need to conduct their operations to be removed, withheld, delayed or burdened by requirements that restrict their ability to profitably conduct business.\nEQM does not insure against all potential losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities.\nEQM is not fully insured against all risks inherent in its business, including environmental accidents that might occur. In addition, EQM does not maintain business interruption insurance of the types and in amounts necessary to cover all possible risks of loss, like project delays caused by governmental action or inaction. The occurrence of any operating risks not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on EQM's business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nWe currently maintain excess liability insurance that covers our and our affiliates', including EQM's, legal and contractual liabilities arising out of bodily injury, personal injury or property damage, including resulting loss of use, to third parties. This excess liability insurance includes coverage for sudden and accidental pollution liability but excludes: release of pollutants subsequent to their disposal; release of substances arising from the combustion of fuels that result in acidic deposition; and testing, monitoring, clean-up, containment, treatment or removal of pollutants from property owned, occupied by, rented to, used by or in the care, custody or control of us and our affiliates, including EQM. We also maintain coverage for us and our affiliates, including EQM, for physical damage to assets and resulting business interruption, including damage caused by terrorist acts.\nAll of our insurance is subject to deductibles or self-insured retentions. If a significant accident or event occurs for which EQM is not fully insured, it could adversely affect EQM's operations and financial condition. We may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance for ourselves and our affiliates, including EQM, of the types and in the amounts we desire at reasonable rates, and we may elect to self-insure a portion of EQM's asset portfolio. The insurance coverage we have obtained or may obtain may contain large deductibles or fail to cover certain hazards or cover all potential losses. In addition, for pre-Distribution losses, we will share insurance coverage with EQT, and we will remain responsible for payment of any deductible or self-insured amounts under those insurance policies. To the extent EQM experiences a pre-Distribution loss that would be covered under EQT's insurance policies, our ability to collect under those policies may be reduced to the extent EQT erodes the limits under those policies.\nTerrorist or cyber security attacks or threats thereof aimed at EQM's pipelines or facilities or surrounding areas and new laws and regulations governing data privacy could adversely affect its business.\nEQM's business has become increasingly dependent upon digital technologies, including information systems, infrastructure and cloud applications, to operate its assets, and the maintenance of EQM's financial and other records has long been dependent upon such technologies. The U.S. government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of cyber security threats. Deliberate attacks on, or unintentional events affecting, EQM's systems or infrastructure, the systems or infrastructure of third parties or the cloud could lead to corruption or loss of EQM's proprietary data and potentially sensitive data, delays in delivery of natural gas and NGLs, difficulty in completing and settling transactions, challenges in maintaining EQM's books and records, communication interruptions, environmental damage, personal injury, property damage and other operational disruptions, as well as damage to our reputation, financial condition and cash flows. Further, as cyber incidents continue to evolve, EQM may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance its protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents. In addition, new U.S. laws and regulations governing data privacy and the unauthorized disclosure of personal information may potentially elevate EQM's compliance costs. Any failure by EQM to comply with these laws and regulations, including as a result of a cyber incident, could result in significant penalties and liability to EQM. Additionally, if EQM acquires a company that has violated or is not in compliance with applicable data protection laws, EQM may incur significant liabilities and penalties as a result.\nEQM is subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations that may expose it to significant costs and liabilities.\nEQM's operations are regulated extensively at the federal, state and local levels. Laws, regulations and other legal requirements have increased the cost to plan, design, install, operate and abandon gathering, transmission and water systems and pipelines. Environmental, health and safety legal requirements govern discharges of substances into the air, water and ground; the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes; the clean-up of contaminated sites; groundwater quality and availability; plant and wildlife protection; locations available for pipeline construction; environmental impact studies and assessments prior to permitting; restoration of properties after construction or operations are completed; pipeline safety (including replacement requirements); and work practices related to employee health and safety. Compliance with the laws, regulations and other legal requirements applicable to EQM's business, including delays in obtaining permits or other government approvals, may increase EQM's cost of doing business, result in delays or restrictions in the performance of operations due to the need to obtain additional or more detailed permits or other governmental approvals or even cause EQM not to pursue a project. For example, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service continues to receive hundreds of petitions to consider listing of additional species as endangered or threatened and is being regularly sued or threatened with lawsuits to address these petitions. Some of these legal actions may result in the listing of species located in areas in which EQM operates. Such designations of previously unprotected species as being endangered or threatened, or the designation of previously unprotected areas as a critical habitat for such species, can result in increased costs, construction delays, restrictions in EQM's operations or abandonment of projects. Listing of aquatic species could potentially affect water supplies or delay related infrastructure development. In addition, compliance with laws, regulations or other legal requirements could subject EQM to claims for personal injuries, property damage and other damages. EQM's failure to comply with the laws, regulations and other legal requirements applicable to its business, even if as a result of factors beyond its control, could result in the suspension or termination of its operations and subject EQM to administrative, civil and criminal penalties and damages.\nLaws, regulations and other legal requirements are constantly changing, and implementation of compliant processes in response to such changes could be costly and time consuming. For example, in October 2015, the EPA revised the NAAQS for ozone from 75 parts per billion for the current 8-hour primary and secondary ozone standards to 70 parts per billion for both standards. The EPA may designate the areas in which EQM operates as nonattainment areas. States that contain any areas designated as nonattainment areas will be required to develop implementation plans demonstrating how the areas will attain the applicable standard within a prescribed period of time. These plans may require the installation of additional equipment to control emissions. In addition, in May 2016, the EPA finalized rules that impose volatile organic compound emissions limits (and collaterally reduce methane emissions) on certain types of compressors and pneumatic pumps, as well as requiring the\ndevelopment and implementation of leak monitoring plans for compressor stations. The EPA finalized amendments to some requirements in these standards in March 2018 and September 2018, including rescission of certain requirements and revisions to other requirements such as fugitive emissions monitoring frequency. Compliance with these or other new regulations could, among other things, require installation of new emission controls on some of EQM's equipment, result in longer permitting timelines, and significantly increase EQM's capital expenditures and operating costs, which could adversely impact EQM's business. In addition to periodic changes to air, water and waste laws, as well as recent EPA initiatives to impose climate change-based air regulations on industry, the U.S. Congress and various states have been evaluating climate-related legislation and other regulatory initiatives that would further restrict emissions of GHGs, including methane (a primary component of natural gas) and carbon dioxide (a byproduct of burning natural gas). Several states are also pursuing similar measures to regulate emissions of GHGs from new and existing sources. If implemented, such GHG restrictions may result in additional compliance obligations with respect to, or taxes on the release, capture and use of GHGs that could have an adverse effect on EQM's operations.\nThere is a risk that EQM may incur costs and liabilities in connection with its operations due to historical industry operations and waste disposal practices, its handling of wastes and potential emissions and discharges related to EQM's operations. Private parties, including the owners of the properties through which EQM's gathering system or its transmission and storage system pass and facilities where its wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal, may have the right to pursue legal actions to require remediation of contamination or enforce compliance with environmental requirements as well as to seek damages for personal injury or property damage. In addition, changes in environmental laws occur frequently, and any such changes that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on EQM's business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us. EQM may not be able to recover all or any of these costs from insurance.\nClimate change and related legislation, regulatory initiatives and litigation could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the natural gas services EQM provides.\nLegislative and regulatory measures to address climate change and GHG emissions are in various phases of discussion or implementation. The EPA regulates GHG emissions from new and modified facilities that are potential major sources of criteria pollutants under the Clean Air Act's Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V programs and has adopted regulations that require, among other things, preconstruction and operating permits for certain large stationary sources and the monitoring and reporting of GHGs from certain onshore oil and natural gas production sources on an annual basis.\nIn addition, the U.S. Congress, along with federal and state agencies, has considered measures to reduce the emissions of GHGs. Legislation or regulation that restricts carbon emissions could increase EQM's cost of environmental compliance by requiring it to install new equipment to reduce emissions from larger facilities and/or, depending on any future legislation, purchase emission allowances. Climate change and GHG legislation or regulation could also delay or otherwise negatively affect efforts to obtain and maintain permits and other regulatory approvals for existing and new facilities, impose additional monitoring and reporting requirements or adversely affect demand for the natural gas EQM gathers, transports and stores. Conversely, legislation or regulation that sets a price on or otherwise restricts carbon emissions could also benefit EQM by increasing demand for natural gas because the combustion of natural gas results in substantially fewer carbon emissions per Btu of heat generated than other fossil fuels such as coal. The effect on EQM of any new legislative or regulatory measures will depend on the particular provisions that are ultimately adopted.\nSignificant portions of EQM's pipeline systems have been in service for several decades. There could be unknown events or conditions, or increased maintenance or repair expenses and downtime associated with its pipelines that could have a material adverse effect on EQM's business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make distributions.\nSignificant portions of EQM's transmission and storage system and FERC-regulated gathering system have been in service for several decades. The age and condition of these systems could result in increased maintenance or repair expenditures, and any downtime associated with increased maintenance and repair activities could materially reduce EQM's revenue. Any significant increase in maintenance and repair expenditures or loss of revenue due to the age or condition of EQM's systems could adversely affect its business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nEQM may incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of increasingly stringent pipeline safety regulation, including pipeline integrity management program testing and related repairs.\nThe DOT, acting through PHMSA, has adopted regulations requiring pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs for transmission pipelines located where a leak or rupture could harm HCAs, including high population areas, unless the operator effectively demonstrates by risk assessment that the pipeline could not affect the area. The regulations require operators, including EQM, to:\n\u2022\nperform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity;\n\u2022\nidentify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact an HCA;\n\u2022\nmaintain processes for data collection, integration and analysis;\n\u2022\nrepair and remediate pipelines as necessary; and\n\u2022\nimplement preventive and mitigating actions.\nChanges to pipeline safety laws and regulations that result in more stringent or costly safety standards could have a significant adverse effect on EQM and similarly situated midstream operators. For example, in April 2016, PHMSA published a notice of proposed rulemaking addressing several integrity management topics and proposing new requirements to address safety issues for natural gas transmission and gathering lines. The proposed rule would strengthen existing integrity management requirements, expand assessment and repair requirements to pipelines in areas with medium population densities and extend regulatory requirements to onshore gas gathering lines that are currently exempt. Further, in June 2016, then-President Obama signed the 2016 Pipeline Safety Act that extended PHMSA's statutory mandate under prior legislation through 2019. In addition, the 2016 Pipeline Safety Act empowered PHMSA to address imminent hazards by imposing emergency restrictions, prohibitions and safety measures on owners and operators of gas or hazardous liquid pipeline facilities without prior notice or an opportunity for a hearing and also required PHMSA to develop new safety standards for natural gas storage facilities by June 2018. Pursuant to those provisions of the 2016 Pipeline Safety Act, in October 2016 and December 2016, PHMSA issued two Interim Final Rules that expanded the agency's authority to impose emergency restrictions, prohibitions and safety measures and strengthened the rules related to underground natural gas storage facilities, including well integrity, wellbore tubing and casing integrity. The December 2016 Interim Final Rule, relating to underground gas storage facilities, went into effect in January 2017, with a compliance deadline in January 2018. PHMSA determined, however, that it will not issue enforcement citations to any operators for violations of provisions of the December 2016 Interim Final Rule that had previously been non-mandatory provisions of American Petroleum Institute Recommended Practices 1170 and 1171 until one year after PHMSA issues a final rule; however, no final rule has been issued. Additionally, in January 2017, PHMSA announced a new final rule regarding hazardous liquid pipelines, which increases the quality and frequency of tests that assess the condition of pipelines, requires operators to annually evaluate the existing protective measures in place for pipeline segments in HCAs, extends certain leak detection requirements for hazardous liquid pipelines not located in HCAs, and expands the list of conditions that require immediate repair. However, it is unclear when or if this rule will go into effect because, on January 20, 2017, the Trump Administration requested that all regulations that had been sent to the Office of the Federal Register, but were not yet published, be immediately withdrawn for further review. Accordingly, this rule has not become effective through publication in the Federal Register. We are monitoring and evaluating the effect of these and other emerging requirements on EQM's operations.\nStates are generally preempted by federal law in the area of pipeline safety, but state agencies may qualify to assume responsibility for enforcing federal regulations over intrastate pipelines. They may also promulgate additive pipeline safety regulations provided that the state standards are at least as stringent as the federal standards. Although many of EQM's natural gas facilities fall within a class that is not subject to integrity management requirements, EQM may incur significant costs and liabilities associated with repair, remediation, preventive or mitigation measures associated with its non-exempt transmission pipelines. The costs, if any, for repair, remediation, preventive or mitigating actions that may be determined to be necessary as a result of the testing program, as well as lost cash flows resulting from shutting down EQM's pipelines during the pendency of such actions, could be material.\nShould EQM fail to comply with DOT regulations adopted under authority granted to PHMSA, it could be subject to penalties and fines. PHMSA has the authority to impose civil penalties for pipeline safety violations up to a maximum of approximately $200,000 per day for each violation and approximately $2 million for a related series of violations. This maximum penalty authority established by statute will continue to be adjusted periodically to account for inflation. In addition, EQM may be required to comply with new safety regulations and make additional maintenance capital expenditures in the future for similar regulatory compliance initiatives that are not reflected in its forecasted maintenance capital expenditures.\nThe adoption of legislation relating to hydraulic fracturing and the enactment of new or increased severance taxes and impact fees on natural gas production could cause EQM's current and potential customers to reduce the number of wells they drill in the Marcellus, Utica and Upper Devonian Shales or curtail production of existing wells. If reductions are significant for those or other reasons, the reductions would have a material adverse effect on EQM's business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nEQM's assets are primarily located in the Marcellus Shale fairway in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia and the Utica Shale fairway in eastern Ohio, and a substantial majority of the production that EQM receives from customers is produced from wells completed using hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and commonly used process in the completion of oil and gas wells, particularly in unconventional resource plays like the Marcellus, Utica and Upper Devonian Shales. Hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions and similar agencies, but several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over aspects of the process, including the EPA, which finalized effluent limit guidelines allowing zero discharge of waste water from shale gas extraction operations to a publicly owned treatment plant in 2016 in addition to existing limits on direct discharges. Additionally, in response to increased public concern regarding the alleged potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuels and published permitting guidance in February 2014 addressing the performance of such activities using diesel fuels. The federal Bureau of Land Management (BLM), has also asserted regulatory authority over aspects of the process, and issued a final rule in March 2015 that established more stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands. The BLM rule was struck down by a federal court in Wyoming in June 2016, but was reinstated on appeal by the Tenth Circuit in September 2017. While this appeal was pending, BLM proposed a rulemaking in July 2017 to rescind these rules in their entirety. BLM published a final rule rescinding the 2015 rules in December 2017. However, other federal or state agencies may look to the BLM rule in developing new regulations that could apply to EQM's operations.\nThe U.S. Congress has from time to time considered the adoption of legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing, while a growing number of states, including those in which EQM operates, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent disclosure and/or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. Some states, such as Pennsylvania, have imposed fees on the drilling of new unconventional oil and gas wells. States could elect to prohibit hydraulic fracturing altogether, as was announced in December 2014 with regard to hydraulic fracturing activities in New York. Also, certain local governments have adopted, and additional local governments may further adopt, ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. Further, several federal governmental agencies are conducting reviews and studies on the environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing, including the EPA. For example, in December 2016, the EPA issued its final report on a study it had conducted over several years regarding the effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water sources. The final report, contrary to several previously published draft reports issued by the EPA, found instances in which impacts to drinking water may occur. However, the report also noted significant data gaps that prevented the EPA from determining the extent or severity of these impacts. The results of such reviews or studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing.\nState and federal regulatory agencies recently have focused on a possible connection between the hydraulic fracturing related activities and the increased occurrence of seismic activity. When caused by human activity, such events are called induced seismicity. In a few instances, operators of injection disposal wells in the vicinity of seismic events have been ordered to reduce injection volumes or suspend operations. Some state regulatory agencies, including those in Colorado, Ohio, Oklahoma and Texas, have modified their regulations to account for induced seismicity. While Pennsylvania is not one of the states where such regulation has been enacted, regulatory agencies at all levels are continuing to study the possible linkage between oil and gas activity and induced seismicity. These developments could result in additional regulation and restrictions on the use of injection disposal wells and hydraulic fracturing. Such regulations and restrictions could cause delays and impose additional costs and restrictions on EQM's customers.\nThe adoption of new laws, regulations or ordinances at the federal, state or local levels imposing more stringent restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could make it more difficult for EQM's customers to complete natural gas wells, increase customers' costs of compliance and doing business, and otherwise adversely affect the hydraulic fracturing services they perform, which could negatively impact demand for EQM's gathering, transmission and storage, or water services.\nFurthermore, the tax laws, rules and regulations that affect EQM's customers are subject to change. For example, Pennsylvania's governor and legislature have continued to discuss the imposition of a state severance tax on the extraction of natural resources, including natural gas produced from the Marcellus, Utica and Upper Devonian Shale formations, either in replacement of or in addition to the existing state impact fee. A consensus on the characteristics, such as the effective tax rate, or enactment of a state severance tax has yet to be reached. Any such increase or change could adversely impact the earnings,\ncash flows and financial position of EQM's customers and cause them to reduce their drilling in the areas in which EQM operates.\nEQM's exposure to direct commodity price risk may increase in the future.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, approximately 54% and 84%, respectively, of EQM's revenues were generated from firm reservation fees under long-term contracts. The decrease from 2017 to 2018 reflects the inclusion of RMP's gathering systems for a full year compared to the period from November 13, 2017 through December 31, 2017, as RMP's gathering systems were not supported by contracts with firm reservation fee components. Rather, all of RMP's gathering revenues were generated under long-term interruptible service contracts. As a result, following the Rice Merger, EQM has greater exposure to short- and medium-term declines in volumes of gas produced and gathered on its systems than it has historically. Although EQM intends to execute long-term firm contracts with new customers in the future, its efforts to obtain such contractual terms may not be successful. EQM's water service agreements are volumetric in nature and therefore may be more sensitive to fluctuations in commodity prices and downturns in production by EQM's customers in the future. In addition, EQM may acquire or develop additional midstream assets in the future that do not provide services primarily based on capacity reservation charges or other fixed fee arrangements and therefore have a greater exposure to fluctuations in commodity price risk than its current operations. Future exposure to the volatility of natural gas prices, including regional basis differentials, as a result of EQM's future contracts could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nEQM does not own all of the land on which its pipelines and facilities are located, which could disrupt its operations.\nEQM does not own all of the land on which its pipelines and facilities have been constructed, and it is therefore subject to the possibility of more onerous terms and/or increased costs to retain necessary land use if it does not have valid rights-of-way, if such rights-of-way lapse or terminate or if its facilities are not properly located within the boundaries of such rights-of-way. Although many of these rights are perpetual in nature, EQM occasionally obtains the rights to construct and operate its pipelines on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time. If EQM were to be unsuccessful in negotiating or renegotiating rights-of-way, it might have to institute condemnation proceedings on its FERC-regulated assets or relocate its facilities for non-regulated assets. A loss of rights-of-way or a relocation could have a material adverse effect on EQM's business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us. Additionally, even when EQM owns an interest in the land on which its pipelines and facilities have been constructed, agreements with correlative rights owners may require EQM to relocate pipelines and facilities, shut in storage facilities to facilitate the development of the correlative rights owners' estate, or pay the correlative rights owners the lost value of their estate if they are not willing to accommodate development.\nAny significant and prolonged change in or stabilization of natural gas prices could have a negative impact on EQM's natural gas storage business.\nHistorically, natural gas prices have been seasonal and volatile, which has enhanced demand for and increased the value of EQM's storage services. The natural gas storage business has benefited from significant short-term price fluctuations and seasonal price sensitivity, which impacts the level of demand for EQM's services and the rates it is able to charge for such services. On a system-wide basis, natural gas is typically injected into storage between April and October when natural gas prices are generally lower and withdrawn during the winter months of November through March when natural gas prices are typically higher. However, the market for natural gas may not continue to experience short-term volatility and seasonal price sensitivity in the future at the levels previously seen. If price volatility and seasonality in the natural gas industry decrease, because of increased production volumes and higher demand for natural gas during the injection season, the demand for EQM's storage services and the prices that EQM will be able to charge for those services may decline.\nIn addition to volatility and seasonality, an extended period of high natural gas prices would increase the cost of acquiring base gas and drilling new storage wells due to higher demand for drilling rigs and likely place upward pressure on the costs of associated storage expansion activities. An extended period of low natural gas prices could adversely impact storage values for some period of time until market conditions adjust. These commodity price impacts could have a negative impact on EQM's business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nEQM has entered into joint ventures, and may in the future enter into additional or modify existing joint ventures, that might restrict its operational and corporate flexibility. In addition, these joint ventures are subject to many of the same operational risks to which EQM is subject.\nEQM has entered into joint ventures to construct the MVP and MVP Southgate projects and may in the future enter into additional joint venture arrangements with third parties. Joint venture arrangements may restrict EQM's operational and corporate flexibility. Because EQM does not control all of the decisions of the MVP Joint Venture, it may be difficult or impossible for EQM to cause the joint venture to take actions that EQM believes would be in EQM's or the joint venture's best interests. For example, EQM cannot unilaterally cause the distribution of cash by the MVP Joint Venture. Moreover, joint venture arrangements involve various risks and uncertainties, such as committing EQM to fund operating and/or capital expenditures, the timing and amount of which EQM may not control, and EQM's joint venture partners may not satisfy their financial obligations to the joint venture.\nIn addition, the operations of the MVP Joint Venture and any joint ventures we or EQM may enter into in the future are subject to many of the same operational risks to which we and EQM are subject to.\nEQM's significant indebtedness, and any future indebtedness, as well as the restrictions under EQM's debt agreements, could adversely affect its operating flexibility, business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nEQM's debt agreements contain various covenants and restrictive provisions that limit EQM's ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional debt;\n\u2022\nmake distributions on or redeem or repurchase units;\n\u2022\nincur or permit liens on assets;\n\u2022\nenter into certain types of transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nenter into certain mergers or acquisitions; and\n\u2022\ndispose of all or substantially all of its assets.\nIn October 2018, EQM amended and restated its credit facility to increase the borrowing capacity from $1 billion to $3 billion and extend the term to October 2023. EQM's credit facility contains a covenant requiring EQM to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of not more than 5.00 to 1.00 (or not more than 5.50 to 1.00 for certain measurement periods following the consummation of certain acquisitions). EQM's ability to meet these covenants can be affected by events beyond its control and EQM cannot assure its unitholders that it will meet these covenants. In addition, EQM's $3 billion credit facility contains events of default customary for such facilities, including the occurrence of a change of control. Furthermore, in June 2018, EQM issued senior unsecured notes in an aggregate principal amount of $2.5 billion, consisting of $1.1 billion in aggregate principal amount of its 4.75% senior notes due 2023, $850 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.50% senior notes due 2028, and $550 million in aggregate principal amount of its 6.50% senior notes due 2048.\nThe provisions of EQM's debt agreements may affect EQM's ability to obtain future financing and pursue attractive business opportunities and its flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in business conditions. In addition, a failure to comply with the provisions of EQM's debt agreements could result in an event of default, which could enable EQM's creditors to, subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable agreement, declare any outstanding principal of that debt, together with accrued and unpaid interest, to be immediately due and payable. If the payment of EQM's debt is accelerated, EQM's assets may be insufficient to repay such debt in full, and its unitholders and our shareholders could experience a partial or total loss of their investments. EQM's credit facility also has cross default provisions that apply to any other indebtedness EQM may have with an aggregate principal amount in excess of $25 million.\nEQM may in the future incur additional debt. EQM's level of debt could have important consequences to EQM, including the following:\n\u2022\nEQM's ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired, or such financing may not be available on favorable terms;\n\u2022\nEQM's funds available for operations, future business opportunities and distributions to unitholders, including us, will be reduced by that portion of its cash flow required to make interest payments on its debt;\n\u2022\nEQM may be more vulnerable to competitive pressures or a downturn in its business or the economy generally; and\n\u2022\nEQM's flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions may be limited.\nEQM's ability to service its debt will depend upon, among other things, its future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond its control. If EQM's operating results are not sufficient to service its current or future indebtedness, EQM will be forced to take actions such as reducing distributions, reducing or delaying its business activities, acquisitions, investments or capital expenditures, selling assets or seeking additional equity capital. EQM may not be able to effect any of these actions on satisfactory terms or at all.\nEQM's substantial indebtedness and the additional debt EQM will incur in the future for, among other things, working capital, capital expenditures, capital contributions to the MVP Joint Venture, acquisitions or operating activities may adversely affect EQM's liquidity and therefore its ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nIn addition, EQM's significant indebtedness may be viewed negatively by credit rating agencies, which could result in increased costs for EQM or us to access the capital markets. Any future downgrade of the debt issued by EQM or its subsidiaries could significantly increase its capital costs or adversely affect EQM's or our ability to raise capital in the future.\nA downgrade of EQM's credit ratings, which are determined by independent third parties, could impact EQM's liquidity, access to capital, and costs of doing business.\nIf any credit rating agency downgrades EQM's credit ratings, EQM's access to credit markets may be limited, EQM's borrowing costs could increase, and EQM may be required to provide additional credit assurances in support of commercial agreements, such as joint venture agreements and construction contracts, the amount of which may be substantial. EQM's credit ratings by Moody's, S&P and Fitch were Ba1, BBB- and BBB-, respectively, as of February 14, 2019. In order to be considered investment grade, EQM must be rated Baa3 or higher by Moody's, BBB- or higher by S&P and BBB- or higher by Fitch. EQM's non-investment grade credit rating by Moody's and any future downgrade of EQM's S&P and/or Fitch credit ratings to non-investment grade may result in greater borrowing costs and collateral requirements than would be available to EQM if all its credit ratings were investment grade. EQM's ability to access capital markets could also be limited by economic, market or other disruptions. An increase in the level of EQM's indebtedness in the future may result in a downgrade in the ratings that are assigned to its debt. Credit rating agencies perform an independent analysis when assigning credit ratings. This analysis includes a number of criteria such as business composition, market and operational risks, as well as various financial tests. Credit rating agencies continue to review the criteria for industry sectors and various debt ratings and may make changes to those criteria from time to time. Credit ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the ratings agencies.\nIncreases in interest rates could adversely impact demand for EQM's storage capacity, its unit price, its ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes and its ability to make quarterly cash distributions at its intended levels.\nThere is a financing cost for EQM's customers to store natural gas in its storage facilities. That financing cost is impacted by the cost of capital or interest rates incurred by the customer in addition to the commodity cost of the natural gas in inventory. Absent other factors, a higher financing cost adversely impacts the economics of storing natural gas for future sale. As a result, a significant increase in interest rates could adversely affect the demand for EQM's storage capacity independent of other market factors. In addition, interest rates on EQM's current credit facility, future credit facilities and debt securities could be higher than current levels, causing EQM's financing costs to increase. As with other yield-oriented securities, EQM's unit price is impacted by the level of its cash distributions and implied distribution yield. The distribution yield is often used by investors to compare and rank yield-oriented securities for investment decision-making purposes. Therefore, changes in interest rates, either positive or negative, may affect the yield requirements of investors who invest in EQM's units, and a rising interest rate environment could have an adverse impact on EQM's unit price, its ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes and its ability to make quarterly cash distributions at its intended levels.", "PERMNO": 18150, "SIC": 4922, "TIC": "ETRN"}
