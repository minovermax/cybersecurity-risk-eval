Risk Factors\nReaders should carefully consider, in connection with other information disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the risks and uncertainties described below. The following discussion sets forth risks that we believe are material to our stockholders and prospective stockholders. The occurrence of any of the following risks might cause our stockholders to lose all or a part of their investment in our Company. We cannot assure you that the risk factors described below or elsewhere in this document are a complete set of all potential risks we may face; additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or not believed by us to be material may also affect our business results, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock. Some statements in this report, including statements in the following risk factors section, constitute forward-looking statements. Please also refer to the section titled \u201cForward Looking Statements\u201d at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur services to Popular account for a significant portion of our revenues, and we expect that our services to Popular will continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future.\nIn 2021, we derived approximately 42% of our revenue from our relationship with Popular and the MSA is our most significant client contract, which has an initial term ending in 2025. The majority of Popular\u2019s business is presented in the Business Solutions segment. If Popular were to terminate or fail to perform under the MSA, or our other material agreements with Popular, our revenues could be materially reduced and our profitability and cash flows could also be materially reduced, all of which would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to maintain our merchant relationships and our alliance with Popular, our business may be materially adversely affected.\nGrowth in our merchant acquiring business is derived primarily from acquiring new merchant relationships, new and enhanced product and service offerings, cross selling products and services into existing relationships, the shift of consumer spending to increased usage of electronic forms of payment, and the strength of our relationship with Banco Popular, a wholly owned subsidiary of Popular. A substantial portion of our business is generated from our Independent Sales Organization Sponsorship and Services Agreement (the \u201cISO Agreement\u201d) with Banco Popular, which has an initial term ending in 2025.\nBanco Popular acts as a merchant referral source and provides sponsorship into the ATH, Visa, Discover and MasterCard networks for merchants, as well as card association sponsorship, clearing and settlement services. We provide transaction-processing and related functions. Both we and Popular, as alliance partners, may provide management, sales, marketing, and other administrative services to merchants. We rely on the continuing growth of our merchant relationships, which in turn is dependent upon our alliance with Banco Popular and other distribution channels. There can be no guarantee that this growth will continue and the loss or deterioration of these relationships, whether due to the termination of the ISO Agreement or otherwise, could negatively impact our business and result in a material reduction of our revenue and income.\nIf we are unable to renew or negotiate extensions for our MSA with Popular, our ISO Agreement with Banco Popular and our ATH Network Participation Agreement and ATH Support Agreement with Banco Popular (the \u201cBPPR ATH Agreements\"), or if we are required to provide significant concessions to Popular or Banco Popular to secure extensions or otherwise, our ability to renegotiate our debt, results of operations, financial condition and trading price of our common stock may be materially adversely affected.\nWe regularly discuss with Popular the terms of the MSA and the services we provide to Popular thereunder. We cannot be certain that we will be able to negotiate an extension to the MSA upon its expiration on its terms. Even if we are able to negotiate an extension of the MSA, any new master services agreement may be materially different from the existing MSA. Further, Popular may require significant concessions from us with respect to pricing, services, and other key terms, both in respect of the current term and any future extension of the MSA. Any such events may materially and negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and trading price of our common stock, as well as potentially limit our ability to renegotiate our debt.\nPursuant to our ISO Agreement with Banco Popular, Banco Popular sponsors us as an independent sales organization with respect to certain credit card associations and is required to exclusively refer to us any merchant that inquires about, requests or otherwise evidences interest in merchant and other services. If the ISO Agreement is not renewed, we will have to seek other card association sponsors, we will not benefit from Banco Popular referral of merchants and we may experience the loss of\nsome merchants if Banco Popular itself enters the merchant acquiring business or agrees to sponsor another independent sales organization. Any of these events may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe BPPR ATH Agreements also have initial terms ending in 2025. Under such agreements, among other things, we provide Banco Popular certain ATM and POS services in connection with our ATH network; we grant a license to use the ATH logo, word mark and associated trademarks; and Banco Popular agrees to support, promote, and market the ATH network and brand and to issue debit cards bearing the symbol of the ATH network. If one or both of the BPPR ATH Agreements are not extended, our ATH brand and network could be negatively impacted, and our financial condition and results of operations materially adversely affected.\nThe inability to renew or maintain client contracts on favorable terms or at all may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur contracts with private clients generally run for a period of one to five years. Our government contracts generally run for one year and do not include automatic renewal periods due to government procurement rules and related fiscal funding requirements. Our standard merchant contract has an initial term of up to three years, with automatic one-year renewal periods. At the end of the relevant contract term, clients can renew or renegotiate their contracts with us, but may also decide to engage one of our competitors to provide products and services. If we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates and/or contract terms that are favorable to us, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe also depend on our payment processing clients to comply with their contractual obligations, applicable laws, regulatory requirements and credit card associations rules or standards. A client's failure to comply with any such laws or requirements could force us to declare a breach of contract and terminate the client relationship. The termination of such contracts or relationships, as well as any inability to collect any damages caused, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Additionally, any such failure by clients to comply could also result in fines, penalties or obligations imputed to EVERTEC, which could also have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on our systems, employees and certain suppliers and counterparties, and certain failures could materially adversely affect our operations.\nMany of our services are based on sophisticated software, technology, and computing systems, and we may encounter delays when developing new technology solutions and services. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience actual and attempted cyber-attacks of our IT networks, such as through phishing scams and ransomware. The technology solutions underlying our services have occasionally contained, and may in the future contain, undetected errors or defects when first introduced or when new versions are released. We may experience difficulties in installing or integrating our technologies on platforms used by our customers.\nOur businesses are dependent on our ability to reliably process, record and monitor a large number of transactions. We settle funds on behalf of financial institutions, other businesses and consumers and process funds transactions from clients, card issuers, payment networks and consumers on a daily basis for a variety of transaction types. Transactions facilitated by us include debit card, credit card, electronic bill payment transactions, ACH payments, electronic benefits transfer (\"EBT\") transactions and check clearing that supports consumers, financial institutions, and other businesses. These payment activities rely upon the technology infrastructure that facilitates the verification of activity with counterparties, the facilitation of the payment and, in some cases, the detection or prevention of fraudulent payments. If any of our financial, accounting, or other data processing systems or applications fail or experience other significant shortcomings, our ability to serve our clients and accordingly our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Such failures or shortcomings could be the result of events that are beyond our control, which may include, for example, computer viruses, fires, electrical or telecommunications outages, natural disasters, disease pandemics, terrorist acts or other unanticipated damage to property or physical assets. Any such shortcoming could also damage our reputation, require us to expend significant resources to correct the defect, and may result in liability to third parties, especially since some of our contractual agreements with financial institutions require the crediting of certain fees if our systems do not meet certain specified service levels.\nThere is also a risk that we may lose critical data or experience system failures. We perform the vast majority of disaster recovery operations ourselves, though we utilize select third parties for some aspects of recovery. To the extent we outsource our disaster recovery, we are at risk of the vendor\u2019s unresponsiveness in the event of breakdowns in our systems. Our property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses or failures that may occur.\nWe are similarly dependent on our employees. Our operations could be materially adversely affected if one or more employees cause a significant operational breakdown or failure, either intentionally or as a result of human error. Suppliers and third\nparties with which we do business could also be sources of operational risk to us, including relating to breakdowns or failures of such parties\u2019 own systems or employees. Any of these occurrences could diminish our ability to operate one or more of our businesses, or result in potential liability to clients, reputational damage and regulatory intervention or fines, any of which could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on the global economy and may have a negative impact on our business, operations, and results.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, and measures taken to contain and/or mitigate it, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place or total lock-down orders and business limitations and shutdowns, have had dramatic adverse consequences for the global economy. The effects of COVID-19 on our business and our financial condition could include but are not limited to the following: (i) payment processing risks associated with disruptions to merchant activity and business failures including chargeback risk; (ii) adverse effects on revenue streams for certain lines of business in the Business Solutions segment (including core banking, network services, IT consulting, cash and item processing); (iii) reduced transactional revenue in our Payment Services - Latin America segment; (iv) additional regulatory requirements; (v) changes to normal operations; (vi) impairments in our ability to timely deliver key projects; (vii) negative effects of general macroeconomic conditions on consumer confidence; (viii) significant reductions or volatility in demand for one or more of our products and (ix) reduced demand from consumers, stemming from the concern of the risk of contracting COVID-19, resulting in loss of profits.\nThese factors may prevail for a significant period of time and may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition even after the COVID-19 outbreak has subsided, including any economic downturn or recession that has occurred or may occur in the future. If these effects are sustained, they could have accounting consequences such as impairments of tangible and intangible long-lived assets and could affect our ability to operate effective internal control over financial reporting and execute expansion plans or invest in product development. Further, to the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, results of operations or financial condition, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nWe are subject to security breaches or other confidential data theft from our systems, which can adversely affect our reputation and business.\nAs part of our business, we electronically receive, process, store and transmit a wide range of confidential information, including sensitive customer information and personal consumer data, such as names and addresses, social security numbers, driver\u2019s license numbers, cardholder data and payment history records. We also operate payment, cash access and electronic card systems. Attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency, complexity and sophistication, a trend we expect will continue. The objectives of these attacks include, among other things, gaining unauthorized access to systems to facilitate financial fraud, disrupt operations, cause denial of service events, corrupt data, and steal non-public information. Such attacks have become a point of focus for individuals, businesses, and governmental entities.\nUnauthorized access to our computer systems or databases could result in the theft or publication of confidential information, the deletion or modification of records or could otherwise cause interruptions in the successful operations of our businesses. These risks are increased when we transmit information over the Internet as our visibility in the global payments industry attracts hackers to conduct attacks on our systems. Our security measures may also be breached due to the mishandling or misuse of information; for example, if such information were erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, either by employees acting contrary to our policies or as a result of a fault in our systems.\nActual or perceived vulnerabilities or data breaches may lead to claims against us, which may require us to spend significant additional resources to remediate by addressing problems caused by breaches and further protect against security or privacy breaches. Additionally, while we maintain insurance policies specifically for cyber-attacks, our current insurance policies may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches, and we may not be able to collect fully, if at all, under these insurance policies. A significant security breach, such as loss of credit card numbers and related information, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and could result in a loss of customers throughout the years. Some of our systems have experienced in the past and may experience in the future security breaches and, although they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results or reputation, there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future. We cannot assure you that our security measures will prevent security breaches or that failure to prevent them will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and reputation. Any breaches of network or data security at our customers, partners or vendors could have similar negative effects.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, we transitioned a significant subset of our employee population to a remote working environment, which may exacerbate various cybersecurity risks to our business, including an increased demand for information\ntechnology resources, an increased risk of phishing and other cybersecurity attacks, and an increased risk of unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information.\nWe are subject to the credit risk that our merchants will be unable to satisfy obligations for which we may also be liable.\nWe are subject to the credit risk of our merchants being unable to satisfy obligations for which we also may be liable. For example, as the merchant acquirer, we are contingently liable for transactions originally acquired by us that are disputed by the cardholder and charged back to the merchants. For certain merchants, if we are unable to collect amounts paid to cardholders in the form of refunds or chargebacks from the merchant, we bear the loss for those amounts. A default on payment obligations by one or more of our merchants could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe ability to adopt technology to changing industry and customer needs or trends may affect our competitiveness or demand for our products, which may adversely affect our operating results.\nChanges in technology may limit the competitiveness of and demand for our services. Our businesses operate in industries that are subject to technological advancements, developing industry standards and changing customer needs and preferences. Also, our customers continue to adopt new technology for business and personal uses. We must anticipate and respond to these industry and customer changes in order to remain competitive within our relative markets. Our inability to respond to new competitors and technological advancements could impact all of our businesses. For example, the ability to adopt technological advancements surrounding POS technology available to merchants could have a material and adverse impact on our merchant acquiring business.\nConsolidations in the banking and financial services industry could adversely affect our revenues by eliminating existing or potential clients and making us more dependent on a more limited number of clients.\nIn recent years, there have been a number of mergers and consolidations in the banking and financial services industry. Mergers and consolidations of financial institutions reduce the number of our clients and potential clients, which could adversely affect our revenues. Further, if our clients fail or merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our clients, or that use fewer of our services, they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services. It is also possible that the larger banks or financial institutions resulting from mergers or consolidations would have greater leverage to negotiate terms less favorable to us or could decide to perform in-house some or all of the services which we currently provide or could provide. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThere may be a change in the use of cards as a payment mechanism or adverse developments with respect to card industry in general.\nIf the number of electronic and digital payment transactions of the type we process does not continue to grow or if businesses or consumers do not continue to adopt our services, it could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our business, financial position, and results of operations. We believe future growth in the use of credit, debit and other electronic and digital payments will be driven by the cost, ease-to-use, and quality of products and services offered to customers and businesses. In order to consistently increase and maintain our profitability, businesses and consumers must continue to use electronic and digital payment methods that we process, including credit and debit cards.\nChanges in credit card association or other network rules or standards could adversely affect our business.\nIn order to provide our transaction-processing services, several of our subsidiaries are registered with or certified by Visa, Discover and MasterCard and other networks as members or as service providers for member institutions. As such, we and many of our customers are subject to card association and network rules that could subject us or our customers to a variety of fines or penalties that may be levied by the card associations or networks for certain acts or omissions by us, acquirer customers, processing customers and merchants. Visa, Discover, MasterCard and other networks, some of which are our competitors, set the standards with which we must comply. The termination of Banco Popular\u2019s or our subsidiaries\u2019 member registration or our subsidiaries\u2019 status as a certified service provider, or any changes in card association or other network rules or standards, including interpretation and implementation of the rules or standards, that increase the cost of doing business or limit our ability to provide transaction-processing services to or through our customers, could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nChanges in interchange fees charged by credit card associations and debit networks could increase our costs or otherwise materially adversely affect our business.\nFrom time to time, card associations and debit networks change interchange, processing, and other fees, which could impact our merchant acquiring and payment services businesses. Competitive pressures could result in our merchant acquiring and payment services businesses absorbing a portion of such increases in the future, which would increase our operating costs, reduce our profit margin, and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation and oversight. Failure to comply with existing and future rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate could materially adversely affect the operations of one or more of our businesses in those jurisdictions.\nOur business is subject to the laws, rules, regulations, and policies in the countries in which we operate, as well as the legal interpretation of such regulations by administrative bodies and the judiciary of those countries. The expansion of our business may also result in increased regulatory oversight and enforcement, as well as any claims by regulatory agencies and courts that we are required to obtain licenses to engage in certain business activity.\nEnforcement of, failure, or perceived failure to comply with laws, rules, regulations, policies, or licensing requirements could result in criminal or civil lawsuits, penalties, fines, forfeiture of significant assets, an outright or partial restriction on our operations, enforcement in one or more jurisdictions, additional compliance and licensure requirements, and force us to change the way we or our users do business. Any changes in our or our users' business methods could increase cost or reduce revenue.\nThe laws, rules, regulations, and policies in the markets in which we operate include, but are not limited to, privacy and user data protection, banking, money transmission, antitrust, anti-money laundering and the export, re-export, and re-transfer abroad of covered items. In addition, our operations in most of the countries where we operate are subject to risks related to compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable U.S. and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials and other third parties.\nPrivacy and Use Data Protection\nOur business relies on the processing of data in multiple jurisdictions and the movement of data across national borders. Legal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data continues to evolve, and regulatory scrutiny in this area is increasing around the world. Significant uncertainty exists as privacy and data protection laws may differ from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements. Our ongoing efforts to comply with privacy, cybersecurity, and data protection laws may entail expenses, may divert resources from other initiatives and projects, and could limit the service we are able to offer. Enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy actions or investigations could damage our reputation and impact us through increased costs or restrictions on our business, and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability.\nBanking\nIn general, financial institution regulators require their supervised institutions to cause their service providers to agree to certain terms and to agree to supervision and oversight by applicable financial regulators, primarily to protect the safety and soundness of the financial institution. We have agreed to such terms and provisions in many of our service agreements with financial institutions.\nWe and our customers are also generally subject to U.S. federal, Puerto Rico and other countries\u2019 laws, rules and regulations that affect the electronic payments industry, including with respect to activities in the countries where we operate and due to our relationship with Popular.\nRegulation of the electronic payment card industry has increased significantly in recent years. There is also continued scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the manner in which payment card networks and card issuers set various fees. Banking regulators have been strengthening their examination guidelines with respect to relationships between banks and their third-party service providers, such as us. Any such heightened supervision of our relationship with Popular could have an effect on our contractual relationship with Popular as well as on the standards applied in the evaluation of our services. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Government Regulation and Payment Network Rules-Regulatory Reform and Other Legislative Initiatives.\u201d\nTo the extent that we are deemed to be controlled by Popular pursuant to regulation and guidance under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the \u201cBHC Act\u201d), we will be subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the U.S. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the \u201cFederal Reserve Board\u201d). The BHC Act defines \u201ccontrol\u201d differently than GAAP, and \u201ccontrol\u201d can be found based on a variety of facts and circumstances. New lines of business, other new activities\nand acquisitions that we may wish to commence or undertake in the future, including the manner in which we conduct our business or may undertake such activities or acquisitions, may not be permissible for us under the BHC Act, the Federal Reserve Board's Regulation K or other applicable U.S. federal banking laws or may require the approval of the Federal Reserve Board or another applicable U.S. federal banking regulator. Potential acquisitions may take longer, be more costly, or make us less attractive as a buyer. There can be no assurance that any required regulatory approvals will be obtained, or that they will be obtained without regulatory conditions. Additional regulatory requirements may be imposed on our activities or acquisitions to the extent we are controlled by Popular and Popular is subject to any supervisory or enforcement action, even if the supervisory actions are unrelated to us or to our business. To the extent that we are deemed to be controlled by Popular for purposes of the BHC Act, we may conduct only activities authorized under the BHC Act and the Federal Reserve Board's Regulation K and other related regulations for a bank holding company or a financial holding company. These restrictions may limit our ability to acquire other businesses or enter into other strategic transactions.\nExport\nWe are also subject to the Export Administration Regulations (\u201cEAR\u201d), which regulates the export, re-export and re-transfer abroad of covered items made or originating in the United States as well as the transfer of covered U.S.-origin technology abroad. There can be no assurance that we have not violated the EAR in past transactions or that our new policies and procedures will prevent us from violating the EAR in every transaction in which we engage. Any such violations of the EAR could result in fines, penalties or other sanctions being imposed on us, which could negatively affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nSome financial institutions refuse, even in the absence of a regulatory requirement, to provide services to companies operating in certain countries or engaging in certain practices because of concerns that the compliance efforts perceived to be necessary may outweigh the usefulness of the service relationship. Our operations outside the United States make it more likely that financial institutions may refuse to conduct business with us for this type of reason. Any such refusal could negatively affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe and our subsidiaries conduct business with financial institutions and/or card payment networks operating in countries whose nationals, including some of our customers, engage in transactions in countries that are the target of U.S. economic sanctions and embargoes, including Cuba. As a U.S.-based entity, we and our subsidiaries are obligated to comply with the economic sanctions regulations administered by OFAC. These regulations prohibit U.S.-based entities from entering into or facilitating unlicensed transactions with, for the benefit of, or in some cases involving the property and property interests of, persons, governments, or countries designated by the U.S. government under one or more sanctions regimes. Various state and municipal governments, universities and other investors maintain prohibitions or restrictions on investments in companies that do business involving sanctioned countries or entities.\nBecause we process transactions on behalf of financial institutions through the payment networks, we have processed a limited number of transactions potentially involving sanctioned countries and there can be no assurances that, in the future, we will not inadvertently process such transactions. Due to a variety of factors, including technical failures and limitations of our transaction screening process, conflicts between U.S. and local laws, political or other concerns in certain countries in which we and our subsidiaries operate, and/or failures in our ability to effectively control employees operating in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, we have not rejected every transaction originating from or otherwise involving sanctioned countries, or persons and there can be no assurances that, in the future, we will not inadvertently fail to reject such transactions.\nAntitrust\nDue to our ownership of the ATH network and our merchant acquiring and payment services business in Puerto Rico, we are involved in a significant percentage of the debit and credit card transactions conducted in Puerto Rico each day. We have in the past been subject to regulatory investigations and any future regulatory scrutiny of, or regulatory enforcement action in connection with, compliance with U.S. state and federal antitrust requirements could potentially have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business. In connection with any acquisitions, in addition to other U.S. federal requirements, we must also comply with antitrust and/or competition law requirements.\nPuerto Rico's fiscal crisis could have a material adverse effect on our business and the trading price of our common stock.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, approximately 80% and 82%, respectively, of our total revenues were generated from our operations in Puerto Rico. Some revenues that are generated from our operations outside Puerto Rico are dependent upon our operations in Puerto Rico. As a result, our financial condition and results of operations are highly dependent on the economic and political conditions in Puerto Rico, and could be significantly impacted by adverse economic or political developments in Puerto Rico, including adverse effects on the trading price of our common stock, our customer base, general consumer spending and the timeliness of the Government's payments, thus increasing our Government accounts receivable, and potentially impairing the collectability of those accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2021, we had net receivables of $14.1 million from the Government and certain public corporations.\nA protracted government shutdown could negatively affect our financial condition\nDuring any protracted federal government shutdown, the federal government may reduce or cut funding for certain welfare and disaster relief programs. Beneficiaries of certain federal programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), obtain their benefits through electronic benefits transfer (EBT) accounts. A temporary or permanent reduction in federal welfare and relief programs could lead to a decrease in electronic benefit card volume. The effect of a protracted government shutdown now or in the future may materially and adversely affect our revenues, profitability, and cash flows.\nPuerto Rico's economy, including its financial crisis and the effects of potential natural disasters, could have a prolonged negative impact on the countries in which we operate and a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nPuerto Rico's location in the Caribbean exposes the island to increased risk of hurricanes and other severe tropical weather conditions and natural disasters. Hurricanes and other natural disasters including earthquakes, and their potential aftermaths, such as widespread power outages in Puerto Rico, damage to infrastructure and communications networks, and the temporary cessation and slow pace of reestablishment of regular day-to-day commerce, may severely impact the economies of Puerto Rico and the Caribbean. Any such events could further accelerate the ongoing emigration trend of Puerto Rico residents to the United States. Any prolonged delay in the repairs to the island's infrastructures, decline in business volumes, insufficient federal recovery and rebuilding assistance and any other economic declines due to hurricanes and their aftermaths may impact demand for our services and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nAs a result of Puerto Rico's high cost of electricity and governmental financial crisis, businesses may be reluctant to establish or expand their operations in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean, or might consider closing operations currently in such locations. If companies in the financial services and related industries decide not to commence new operations or not to expand their existing operations in Puerto Rico, or consider closing operations in Puerto Rico, the demand for our services could be negatively affected.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with our presence in international markets, including political or economic instability.\nOur financial performance and results of operations may be adversely affected by general economic, political, and social conditions and uncertainty in the emerging markets in which we operate. Many countries in Latin America have suffered significant economic, political, and social crises in the past, including most recently as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the related restrictions imposed to mitigate its impact, and these events may occur again in the future. Instability in Latin America has been caused by many different factors, including (i) exposure to foreign exchange variation, (ii) significant governmental influence over local economies; (iii) substantial fluctuations in economic growth; (iv) high inflation levels or domestic interest rates; (v) wage, price or exchange controls, or restrictions on expatriation of earnings; (vi) changes in governmental economic or tax policies or unexpected changes in regulation which may restrict the movement of funds or results in the deprivation of contract or property rights; (vii) imposition of trade barriers; (viii) terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war; and (ix) overall political, social, and economic instability. Any of these events in the markets in which we operate could result in a material adverse impact on our business.\nFailure to protect our intellectual property rights and defend ourselves from potential intellectual property infringement claims may diminish our competitive advantages or restrict us from delivering our services, which could result in a material and adverse impact on our business operations.\nOur trademarks, proprietary software, and other intellectual property, including technology/software licenses, are important to our future success. Limitations or restrictions on our ability to use such marks or a diminution in the perceived quality associated therewith could have an adverse impact on the growth of our businesses. We also rely on proprietary software and\ntechnology, including third party software that is used under licenses. It is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar software or technology, which would permit them to compete with us more efficiently. If any of the third-party software or technology licenses are terminated or otherwise determined to be unenforceable, then we would have to obtain a comparable license, which may involve increased license fees and other costs.\nUnauthorized parties may attempt to copy or misappropriate certain aspects of our services, infringe upon our rights, or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Policing such unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is often very difficult, and therefore, we are unable to guarantee that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our proprietary software/technology or that the agreements entered into for that purpose will be effective or enforceable in all instances. Misappropriation of our intellectual property or potential litigation concerning such matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Our registrations and/or applications for trademarks, copyrights, and patents could be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented by others and may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with maximum protection or meaningful advantage. Managing any such challenges, even if they lack merit, could: (i) be expensive and time-consuming to defend; (ii) cause us to cease making, licensing, or using software or applications that incorporate the challenged intellectual property; (iii) require us to redesign our software or applications, if feasible; (iv) divert management\u2019s attention and resources; and (v) require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies. The laws of certain foreign countries in which we do business or contemplate doing business in the future may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States or Puerto Rico. Adverse determinations in judicial or administrative proceedings related to intellectual property or licenses could prevent us from selling our services and products or prevent us from preventing others from selling competing services, impose liability costs on us, or result in a non-favorable settlement, all of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf EVERTEC Group does not comply with the terms of its preferential tax exemption grant, it may be subject to reduction of the benefits of the grant, tax penalties, other payment obligations or full revocation of the grant, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and our stock price.\nEVERTEC Group has a tax exemption grant under the Tax Incentive Act No. 73 of 2008 from the Government of Puerto Rico. Under this grant, EVERTEC Group will benefit from a preferential income tax rate of 4% on industrial development income, as well as from tax exemptions with respect to its municipal and property tax obligations for certain activities derived from its data processing operations in Puerto Rico. The grant has a term of 15 years effective as of January 1, 2012 with respect to income tax obligations and July 1, 2013 and January 1, 2013 with respect to municipal and property tax obligations, respectively.\nThe grant contains customary commitments, conditions, and representations that EVERTEC Group is required to comply with in order to maintain the grant. The more significant commitments include: (i) maintaining at least 750 employees in EVERTEC Group\u2019s Puerto Rico data processing operations during 2012 and at least 700 employees for the remaining years of the grant, (ii) investing at least $200.0 million in building, machinery, equipment or computer programs to be used in Puerto Rico during the effective term of the grant (to be made over four year capital investment cycles in $50.0 million increments), (iii) an additional best efforts capital investments requirement of $75.0 million by December 31, 2026 (to be made over four year capital investment cycles in $20.0 million the first three increments and $15.0 million the last increment); and (iv) 80% of EVERTEC Group employees must be residents of Puerto Rico. Failure to meet the requirements could result, among other things, in reductions in the benefits of the grant, tax penalties, other payment obligations or revocation of the grant in its entirety, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Securities, Corporate Structure and Governance\nFuture sales or the possibility of future sales of a substantial amount of our common stock may depress the price of shares of our common stock\nWe may sell additional shares of common stock in subsequent public offerings or otherwise, including financing acquisitions. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue 206,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 71,969,856 are outstanding as of December 31, 2021. All of these shares, other than the 11,654,803 shares held by Popular and the shares held by our officers and directors, are freely transferable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act. We cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or the effect, if any that future issuances and sales of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock (including any shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nWe are a holding company and rely on dividends and other payments, advances, and transfers of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations and pay any dividends.\nWe have no direct operations or significant assets other than the ownership of 100% of the membership interest of Holdings, which in turn has no significant assets other than ownership of 100% of the membership interest of EVERTEC Group. Because we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries, we depend on those entities for dividends and other payments to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations, and to pay any dividends with respect to our common stock. Legal and contractual restrictions in our existing secured credit facilities and other agreements which may govern future indebtedness of our subsidiaries, as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of our subsidiaries, may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. We are prohibited from paying any cash dividend on our common stock unless we satisfy certain conditions. The secured credit facilities also include limitations on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us. The earnings from, or other available assets of, our subsidiaries may not be sufficient to pay dividends or make distributions or loans or enable us to pay any dividends on our common stock or other obligations.\nThe interests of Popular may conflict with or differ from your interests as a stockholder.\nPopular has the right to nominate two members of our Board and, therefore, may be able to influence our decisions. The interests of Popular could conflict with your interests as a holder of shares of our common stock. For example, the concentration of ownership held by Popular, the terms of the Stockholder Agreement and our organizational documents (including Popular\u2019s quorum rights and consent rights over amendments to our bylaws) and Popular\u2019s right to terminate certain of its agreements with us in certain situations upon a change of control of EVERTEC Group, could delay, defer or prevent certain significant corporate actions that you as a stockholder may otherwise view favorably, including a change of control of us (whether by merger, takeover or other business combination). See \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Party Transactions\u201d in our proxy statement for a description of the circumstances under which Popular may terminate certain of its agreements with us. A sale of a substantial number of shares of stock in the future by Popular could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur organizational documents and Stockholder Agreement may impede or discourage a takeover, which could deprive our investors of the opportunity to receive a premium for their shares.\nProvisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and the Stockholder Agreement may make it more difficult for, or prevent a third party from, acquiring control of us without the approval of our Board and/or Popular. These provisions include:\n\u2022a voting agreement pursuant to which Popular agreed to vote its shares in favor of the Popular director nominees (which, constitute the right to appoint two of our nine directors), directors nominated by a committee of our Board in accordance with the Stockholder Agreement and the management director and to remove and replace any such directors in accordance with the terms of the Stockholder Agreement and applicable law and an agreement by us to take all actions within our control necessary and desirable to cause the election, removal and replacement of such directors in accordance with the Stockholder Agreement and applicable law;\n\u2022requiring that a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of the Board (other than a reconvened meeting with the same agenda as the originally adjourned meeting) consist of (1) a majority of the total number of directors then serving on the Board and (2) at least one director nominated by Popular, for so long as it owns, together with its affiliates, 5% or more of our outstanding common stock;\n\u2022prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022authorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock without any need for action by stockholders other than Popular (as further described below);\n\u2022prohibiting stockholders from acting by written consent unless the action is taken by unanimous written consent; and\n\u2022establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our Board or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings, which advance notice requirements are not applicable to any directors nominated in accordance with the terms of the Stockholder Agreement.\nOur issuance of shares of preferred stock could delay or prevent a change in control of us. Our Board has authority to issue shares of preferred stock, subject to the approval of at least one director nominated by Popular for so long as Popular, together with its respective affiliates, owns at least 10% of our outstanding common stock. Our Board may issue preferred stock in one or more series, designate the number of shares constituting any series, and fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions\nthereof, including dividend rights, voting rights, rights and terms of redemption, redemption price or prices and liquidation preferences of such series. Popular, under and subject to the Stockholder Agreement and our organizational documents, will retain significant influence over matters requiring board or stockholder approval, including the election of directors. Together, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Stockholder Agreement could make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock. The existence of the foregoing provisions, as well as the significant percentage of shares of our outstanding common stock owned by Popular and its individual right to nominate a specified number of directors in certain circumstances, could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of us, thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your common stock in an acquisition.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk and prevent us from meeting our obligations with respect to our substantial indebtedness, and we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness, which could further increase such risks.\nWe are highly leveraged. As of December 31, 2021, the total principal amount of our indebtedness was approximately $467.5 million. Our high degree of leverage could have a significant impact on us, including (i) increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry or competitive developments; (ii) requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, reducing our ability to use our cash flow for other purposes, including for our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities; (iii) exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates because our borrowings are predominantly at variable rates of interest; (iv) making it difficult for us to satisfy our indebtedness obligations generally, including complying with restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions, our noncompliance with which could result in an event of default under the agreements setting forth the terms of other indebtedness; (v) restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures; (vi) limiting our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing for working capital, capital expenditures, business development, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and (vii) limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors who may be less highly leveraged.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, some of which may be secured. In addition to the $119.1 million which was available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2021, the terms of the secured credit facilities enable us to increase the amount available under the term loan and/or revolving credit facilities if we are able to obtain loan commitments from banks and satisfy certain other conditions. If new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries\u2019 existing debt levels, the related risks that we face would increase.\nIf we are unable to comply with covenants in our debt instruments that limit our flexibility in operating our business or obligate us to take action such as deliver financial reports, we may default under our debt instruments and our indebtedness may become due.\nThe agreement setting forth the terms of the secured credit facilities contain, and any future indebtedness we incur may contain, various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit our ability and our restricted subsidiaries\u2019 ability to (i) incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares; (ii) pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other restricted payments; (iii) make certain investments; (iv) sell certain assets; (v) grant liens; (vi) consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; (vii) enter into certain transactions with our affiliates; and (viii) designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.\nAs a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs. The covenants in the secured credit facilities require us to maintain a maximum total secured net leverage ratio. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under one or more of these agreements, including as a result of cross default provisions and, in the case of our revolving credit facility, permit the lenders to cease making loans to us. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the secured credit facilities, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the secured credit facilities to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. Such actions by those lenders could cause cross defaults under our other indebtedness. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under our secured credit facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. We have pledged a significant portion of our assets as\ncollateral under the secured credit facilities. If the lenders under the secured credit facilities accelerate the repayment of borrowings, the proceeds from the sale or foreclosure upon such assets will first be used to repay debt under our secured credit facilities and we may not have sufficient assets to repay our unsecured indebtedness thereafter. As a result, our common stock could become worthless.\nDiscontinuation, reform or replacement of LIBOR and other benchmark rates, or uncertainty related to the potential for any of the foregoing, may adversely affect our business.\nAt December 31, 2021, we had $467.5 million of borrowings under our secured credit facilities bearing interest at Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) plus an applicable margin. In July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced its intention to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. However, for U.S. dollar-denominated (\u201cUSD\u201d) LIBOR, only one-week and two-month USD LIBOR have ceased to be published after 2021, and all remaining USD LIBOR tenors will continue being published until June 2023. It is not possible to predict the effect of any changes in the methods by which LIBOR is determined or regulatory activity related to LIBOR's phaseout. Any of these developments could cause LIBOR to perform differently than in the past or cease to exist. If a published U.S. dollar LIBOR rate is unavailable, the interest rates on our debt indexed to LIBOR will be determined using various alternative methods set forth in our existing secured credit facilities, any of which could result in interest obligations that are more than or that do not otherwise correlate over time with the payments that would have been made on this debt if U.S. dollar LIBOR were available in its current form. Any of these proposals or consequences could have a material adverse effect on our financing costs. We may choose in the future to pursue amendments to our secured credit facilities to provide for a comparable or successor rate, but we can give no assurance that we will be able to reach agreement with our lenders on any such amendments.\nAt December 31, 2021, we also had an interest rate swap agreement which is designed to protect us from changes in interest rates. If LIBOR becomes unavailable and market quotations for specified inter-bank lending are not available, it is unclear how payments under such agreement would be calculated, which could cause these agreements to no longer offer us the protection we expect.\nRisks Related to the Popular Transaction\nThe Popular Transaction is contingent upon the satisfaction of a number of conditions, and the transaction may not be consummated on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, or at all.\nOn February 24, 2022, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Popular, Inc. and Banco Popular, pursuant to which we will sell certain assets that are currently used to provide services to Banco Popular under the MSA, and, in connection with the closing of which, we and Banco Popular agreed to enter into certain other agreements and to amend and extend the duration of certain existing commercial agreements (collectively, the \u201cPopular Transaction\u201d).\nThe consummation of the Popular Transaction is subject to certain conditions, including (i) satisfaction of certain regulatory requirements, including under the Hart-Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and the Bank Holding Company Act, (ii) completion of certain actions required in order to operate the acquired assets under Banco Popular ownership (iii) the absence of any injunction or other order from a governmental authority that prevents the closing of the Popular Transaction, and (iv) subject to certain exceptions, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of, and compliance with covenants by, the other party. There can be no assurances that such conditions will be satisfied.\nThe proposed transaction may result in disruptions to relationships with customers and other business partners or may not achieve the intended results and may increase the risk of a change of control of the Company.\nIf we complete the Popular Transaction, there can be no assurance that we will be able to realize the intended benefits of the transaction. Specifically, the Popular Transaction could cause disruptions in our remaining businesses or otherwise limiting the ability to compete for or perform certain contracts or services. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our remaining businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nBanco Popular has agreed that, following the closing of the Popular Transaction, it will seek to sell common stock in an amount sufficient to reduce its shareholding below 5% and if it has not done so within 90 days, subject to the satisfaction of certain requirements by the Company, then it will exchange any shares it holds above 4.5% for newly issued non-voting convertible preferred stock of the Company that will convert automatically into common stock upon a qualified transfer by Banco Popular to an unaffiliated third party.\nThe limited voting stake to be held by Banco Popular, as well as the corresponding reduction in Banco Popular\u2019s right to nominate directors to the Company\u2019s board of directors, may increase the likelihood of a change of control of the Company.\nThe actions required to implement the Popular Transaction will take significant management time and attention\nThe Popular Transaction will require significant amounts of management\u2019s time and resources, which will be in addition to and may divert management\u2019s time and attention from the operation of our remaining businesses and the execution of our other strategic initiatives. Additionally, we will incur costs in connection with the Popular Transaction. These costs must be paid regardless of whether the Popular Transaction is consummated.\nThe Popular Transaction will result in an immediate reduction to our revenues and income and will not provide any cash at closing.\nWhile the term of certain commercial agreements between the Company and Popular will be extended at closing, the Popular Transaction will result in a reduction of revenues to the Company from Banco Popular under the MSA (and related costs) that will primarily impact our Business Services segment. Because the consideration for the asset sale will be shares of common stock that are currently owned by Banco Popular, we will not receive a cash payment at closing. A reduction in the revenues and profitability of our Business Services segment may increase leverage ratios under our existing credit agreement that could impact our indebtedness levels in the future.\n.", "PERMNO": 13837, "SIC": 7374, "TIC": "EVTC"}
