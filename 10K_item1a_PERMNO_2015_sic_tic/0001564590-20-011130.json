{"cik": "946647", "company": "FIRST DEFIANCE FINANCIAL CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe risks listed below present risks that could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, or business. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair the Company\u2019s business operations.\nEconomic, political and financial market conditions may adversely affect First Defiance\u2019s operations and financial condition.\nFirst Defiance\u2019s financial performance generally, and in particular the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans, as well as demand for loans and other products and services First Defiance offers, is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where the Company operates, mainly in the State of Ohio, Northeast Indiana and Southeast Michigan. A favorable business environment is generally characterized by, among other factors, economic growth, efficient capital markets, low inflation, low unemployment, high business and investor confidence, and strong business earnings. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability of or increases in the cost of credit and capital; increases in inflation or interest rates; high unemployment, natural disasters; or a combination of these or other factors. Conditions such as inflation, recession, unemployment, changes in interest rates, fiscal and monetary policy, tariffs, a U.S. withdrawal from a significant renegotiation of trade agreements, trade wars, the election of a new U. S. President in 2020, and other factors beyond First Defiance\u2019s control may adversely affect its deposit levels and composition, the quality of its assets including investment securities available for purchase, demand for loans, the ability of its borrowers to repay their loans and the value of the collateral securing the loans it makes. Because First Defiance has a significant amount of real estate loans, decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral and First Defiance\u2019s ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure.\nRecent political developments have resulted in substantial changes in economic and political conditions for the U. S. and the remainder of the world. Economic turmoil in Europe and Asia and changes in oil production in the Middle East affect the economy and stock prices in the U. S. While these changes do not have a direct, immediate impact on First Defiance\u2019s financial performance, we cannot predict how the change in the political climate will affect the economy and First Defiance\u2019s performance in the future.\nThe outbreak of the novel coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d), or an outbreak of other highly infectious or contagious diseases, could adversely impact certain industries in which First Defiance\u2019s customers operate and impair their ability to fulfill their obligations to First Defiance. Further, the spread of the outbreak could cause severe disruptions in the U.S. economy and may disrupt banking and other financial activity in the areas in which First Defiance operates and could potentially create widespread business continuity issues for First Defiance.\nFirst Defiance\u2019s business is dependent upon the willingness and ability of its employees and customers to conduct banking and other financial transactions. The spread of highly infectious or contagious diseases could cause severe disruptions in the U.S. economy which could disrupt the Company\u2019s operations and if the global response to contain COVID-19 escalates or is unsuccessful, the Company could experience a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The outbreak of COVID-19 or an outbreak of other highly infectious or contagious diseases may result in a decrease in our customers\u2019 businesses or a disruption in the services provided by First Defiance\u2019s vendors. Disruptions to our customers could result in increased risk of delinquencies, defaults, foreclosures and losses on our loans, negatively impact regional economic conditions, result in a decline in local loan demand, loan originations and deposit availability and negatively impact the implementation of our growth strategy. The Company relies upon its third-party vendors to conduct business and to process, record, and monitor transactions. If any of these vendors are unable to continue to provide First Defiance with these services, it could negatively impact the Company\u2019s ability to serve its customers. Furthermore, the outbreak could negatively impact the ability of the Company\u2019s employees and customers to engage in banking and other financial transactions in the geographic areas in which the Company operates and could create widespread business continuity issues for the Company. The Company also could be adversely affected if key personnel or a significant number of employees were to become unavailable due to a COVID-19 outbreak in our market areas. Although the Company has business continuity plans and other safeguards in place, there is no assurance that such plans and safeguards will be effective.\nFirst Defiance\u2019s loan portfolio includes a concentration of commercial real estate loans and commercial loans, which involve risks specific to real estate value and the successful operations of these businesses.\nAt December 31, 2019, First Federal\u2019s portfolio of commercial real estate loans totaled $1.5 billion, or approximately 52.4% of total loans. First Federal\u2019s commercial real estate loans typically have higher principal amounts than residential real estate loans, and many of our commercial real estate borrowers have more than one loan outstanding. As a result, an adverse development on one loan can expose First Defiance to greater risk of loss on other loans. Additionally, repayment of the loans is generally dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the properties securing the loans to cover operating expenses and debt service. Economic conditions and events outside of the control of the borrower or lender could negatively impact the future cash flows and market values of the affected properties.\nAt December 31, 2019, First Federal\u2019s portfolio of commercial loans totaled $578.1 million, or approximately 20.1% of total loans. Commercial loans generally expose First Defiance to a greater risk of nonpayment and loss than commercial real estate or residential real estate loans since repayment of such loans often depends on the successful operations and income stream of the borrowers. First Federal\u2019s commercial loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower such as accounts receivable, inventory, machinery or real estate. In the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers. The collateral securing other loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business. Credit support provided by the borrower for most of these loans and the probability of repayment is based on the liquidation of the pledged collateral and enforcement of a personal guarantee, if any exists.\nFirst Defiance targets its business lending towards small- and medium-sized businesses, many of which have fewer financial resources than larger companies and may be more susceptible to economic downturns. If general economic conditions negatively impact these businesses, First Defiance\u2019s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nIf First Defiance's actual loan losses exceed its allowance for loan losses, First Defiance's net income will decrease.\nIn accordance with GAAP, First Defiance must maintain an allowance for loan losses to provide for loan defaults and non-performance, which when combined, are referred to as the allowance for loan losses. First Defiance's allowance for loan losses is based upon a number of relevant factors, including, but not limited to, trends in the level of nonperforming assets and classified loans, current economic conditions in the primary lending area, prior experience, possible losses arising from specific problem loans, and management's evaluation of the risks in the current portfolio. However, there are many factors that can result in actual loan losses exceeding the allowance.\nFor instance, in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and counterparties, First Defiance may rely on information provided to us by customers and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. First Defiance may also rely on representations of customers and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. Such information may not turn out to be accurate. Further, First Defiance's loan customers may not repay their loans according to their terms, and the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance. As a result, First Defiance may experience significant loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on its operating results.\nThe amount of future losses also is susceptible to changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in interest rates that may be beyond management's control, and these losses may exceed current estimates. Further, federal regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, review First Defiance's loans and allowance for loan losses and may require that First Defiance increase its allowance. Moreover, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) has changed its requirements for establishing the allowance, which became effective for First Defiance in the first quarter of 2020. That accounting change exposes First Defiance to increased risk of failure to establish a sufficient allowance and the possibility that First Defiance will need to increase its allowance substantially through an increase to the provision for loan losses, which will adversely affect First Defiance's net income.\nAs a result of any of the above factors, First Defiance's allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual credit losses, and future provisions for credit losses could have a material adverse effect on First Defiance's operating results. There is no assurance that First Defiance will not further increase the allowance for loan losses. Either of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on First Defiance's financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in interest rates can adversely affect First Defiance\u2019s profitability.\nFirst Defiance\u2019s earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon its net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets such as loans and securities, and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond First Defiance\u2019s control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Federal Open Market Committee. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest First Defiance receives on loans and securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect First Defiance\u2019s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, the fair value of First Defiance\u2019s financial assets and liabilities, and the average duration of certain assets and liabilities. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, First Defiance\u2019s net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. While we generally invest in securities with limited credit risk, certain investment securities we hold possess higher credit risk since they represent beneficial interests in structured investments collateralized by residential mortgages. All investment securities are subject to changes in market value due to changing interest rates and implied credit spreads. Any substantial, unexpected, or prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on First Defiance\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nFirst Federal originates a significant amount of residential mortgage loans that it sells in the secondary market. The origination of residential mortgage loans is highly dependent on the local real estate market and the current interest rates. Increasing interest rates tend to reduce the origination of loans for sale and consequently fee income, which First Defiance reports as mortgage banking income. Conversely, decreasing interest rates have the effect of causing clients to refinance mortgage loans faster than anticipated. This causes the value of mortgage servicing rights on the loans sold to be lower than originally anticipated. If this happens, First Defiance may be required to write down the value of its mortgage servicing rights faster than anticipated, which will increase expense and lower earnings. Accelerated repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities could result in the reinvestment of funds at lower rates than the loans or securities were paying.\nLaws, regulations and periodic regulatory reviews may affect First Defiance\u2019s results of operations.\nThe financial services industry is extensively regulated. First Defiance is subject to extensive state and federal regulation, supervision and legislation that govern almost all aspects of its operations. Laws and regulations may change from time to time and are primarily intended for the protection of consumers, depositors, borrowers, the DIF and the banking system as a whole, and not to benefit First Defiance\u2019s shareholders. Regulations affecting banks and financial services businesses are undergoing continuous changes, and management cannot predict the effect of these changes. The impact of any changes to laws and regulations or other actions by regulatory agencies may negatively impact First Defiance and its ability to increase the value of its business, possibly limiting the services it provides, increasing the potential for competition from non-banks, or requiring it to change the way it operates.\nRegulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on the operation of an institution, the classification of assets held by an institution, the adequacy of an institution\u2019s allowance for loan losses and the ability to complete acquisitions. Additionally, actions by regulatory agencies against First Defiance could cause it to devote significant time and resources to defending its business and may lead to penalties that materially affect First Defiance and its shareholders. Even the reduction of regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on First Defiance and its shareholders if such lessening of restrictions increases competition within First Defiance\u2019s industry or market area.\nFirst Defiance is currently assessing the expected effect of the Payday Rule on First Federal\u2019s business and on First Defiance\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. The costs of complying with this regulation or a determination to discontinue certain types of consumer lending in light of the expense of compliance could have an adverse effect on the financial conditions and results of operations of First Defiance. The impact of this rule on First Federal, both with and without the proposed amendments, is estimated to be minimal.\nIn addition to laws, regulations and actions directed at the operations of banks, proposals to reform the housing finance market could negatively affect First Defiance\u2019s ability to sell loans.\nAlthough it is impossible for First Defiance to predict at this time what changes in laws and regulations will be implemented and the effect they will have on First Defiance and the rest of its industry, it is possible that First Defiance\u2019s revenue could decrease, our interest expense could increase and deposit insurance premiums could change, and steps may need to be taken to increase qualifying capital. First Defiance\u2019s operating and compliance costs could also increase and could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in tax laws could adversely affect First Defiance's financial condition and results of operations.\nFirst Defiance is subject to extensive federal, state and local taxes, including income, excise, sales/use, payroll, franchise, withholding and ad valorem taxes. Changes to the tax laws could have a material adverse effect on First Defiance's results of operations. In addition, First Defiance's customers are subject to a wide variety of federal, state and local taxes. Changes in taxes paid by customers, including changes in the deductibility of mortgage loan related expenses, may adversely affect their ability to purchase homes or consumer products, which could adversely affect their demand for First Defiance's loans and deposit products. In addition, such negative effects on First Defiance's customers could result in defaults on the loans already made and decrease the value of mortgage-backed securities in which First Defiance has invested.\nThe laws and regulations applicable to the banking industry could change at any time. The potential exists for new laws and regulations, and bank regulatory agencies are expected to be active in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations. Increased regulation could increase First Defiance\u2019s cost of compliance and reduce its income to the extent that they limit the manner in which First Defiance may conduct business, including its ability to offer new products, charge fees for specific products and services, obtain financing, attract deposits, make loans and achieve satisfactory interest spreads.\nFirst Defiance\u2019s ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost may adversely affect net income.\nFirst Defiance\u2019s principal sources of liquidity are local deposits and wholesale funding sources such as FHLB advances, Federal Funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, and brokered or other out-of-market certificate of deposit purchases. First Defiance also maintains a portfolio of securities that can be used as a secondary source of liquidity. First Defiance\u2019s access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize its activities or on terms that are acceptable could be impaired by factors that affect First Defiance directly or the financial services industry or economy in general, such as further disruptions in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry.\nOther possible sources of liquidity include the sale or securitization of loans, the issuance of additional collateralized borrowings beyond those currently utilized with the FHLB, the issuance of debt securities and the issuance of preferred or common securities in public or private transactions, or borrowings from a commercial bank. First Defiance does not currently have any borrowings from a commercial bank, but it has used them in the past.\nAny decline in available funding could adversely impact our ability to originate loans, invest in securities, meet our expenses, pay dividends to First Defiance\u2019s shareholders, or fulfill obligations such as repaying First Defiance\u2019s borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIntegrating First Defiance and UCFC after the Merger may be more difficult, costly, or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Merger may not be realized.\nAlthough the Merger closed on January 31, 2020, the integration of First Defiance and UCFC is an ongoing process. First Defiance\u2019s ability to successfully combine and integrate the businesses of First Defiance and UCFC in a manner that permits growth opportunities and does not materially disrupt the existing customer relations nor result in decreased revenues due to loss of customers is a risk. It is possible that the integration process could result in inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect First Defiance\u2019s ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees, or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Merger. Further, First Defiance is dependent upon several outside vendors to make the integration successful. If such vendors are unable to meet their obligations to First Defiance, including because of any issues related to COVID-19, such failure could result impede a successful integration. If First Defiance experiences difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the Merger may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. In addition, the actual cost savings of the Merger could be less than anticipated.\nCompetition affects First Defiance\u2019s earnings.\nFirst Defiance\u2019s continued profitability depends on its ability to continue to effectively compete to originate loans and attract and retain deposits. Competition for both loans and deposits is intense in the financial services industry. The Company competes in its market area by offering superior service and competitive rates and products. The type of institutions First Defiance competes with include large regional commercial banks, smaller community banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking firms, credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance agencies and mutual funds. As a result of their size and ability to achieve economies of scale, certain of First Defiance\u2019s competitors can offer a broader range of products and services than the Company can offer. In addition, the OCC announced in 2018 that it would start accepting applications for bank charters from nondepository financial technology companies engaged in banking activities, which has added to the number of parties with whom the Company competes. Further, technological advances allow consumers to pay bills and transfer funds electronically without banks. Consumers can also shop for higher deposit interest rates at banks across the country, which may offer higher rates because they have few or no physical branches. To stay competitive in its market area, First Defiance may need to adjust the interest rates on its products to match rates of its competition, which could have a negative impact on net interest margin.\nFirst Defiance is at risk of increased losses from fraud.\nCriminals are committing fraud at an increasing rate and are using more sophisticated techniques. In some cases, these individuals are part of larger criminal rings, which allow them to be more effective. Such fraudulent activity has taken many forms, ranging from debit card fraud, check fraud, mechanical devices attached to ATM machines, social engineering and phishing attacks to obtain personal information, or impersonation of clients through the use of falsified or stolen credentials. Additionally, an individual or business entity may properly identify itself, yet seek to establish a business relationship for the purpose of perpetrating fraud. An emerging type of fraud even involves the creation of synthetic identification in which fraudsters \"create\" individuals for the purpose of perpetrating fraud. Further, in addition to fraud committed directly against it, First Defiance may suffer losses as a result of fraudulent activity committed against third parties. Increased deployment of technologies, such as chip card technology, defray and reduce certain aspects of fraud; however, criminals are turning to other sources to steal personally identifiable information, such as unaffiliated healthcare providers and government entities, in order to impersonate the consumer and thereby commit fraud.\nThe increasing complexity of First Defiance\u2019s operations presents varied risks that could affect its earnings and financial condition.\nFirst Defiance processes a large volume of transactions on a daily basis and is exposed to numerous types of risks related to internal processes, people and systems. These risks include, but are not limited to, the risk of fraud by persons inside or outside the Company, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and systems, breaches of data security and our internal control system and compliance with a complex array of consumer and safety and soundness regulations. First Defiance could also experience additional loss as a result of potential legal actions that could arise as a result of operational deficiencies or as a result of noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations.\nFirst Defiance has established and maintains a system of internal controls that provides management with information on a timely basis and allows for the monitoring of compliance with operational standards. These systems have been designed to manage operational risks at an appropriate, cost effective level. Procedures exist that are designed to ensure that policies relating to conduct, ethics, and business practices are followed. Losses from operational risks may still occur, however, including losses from the effects of operational errors.\nUnauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or customer information or confidential trade secrets, whether through a breach of the Company\u2019s computer systems or otherwise, could severely harm its business.\nPotential misuse of funds or information by First Defiance\u2019s employees or by third parties could result in damage to First Defiance\u2019s customers for which First Defiance could be held liable, subject First Defiance to regulatory sanctions and otherwise adversely affect First Defiance\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nFirst Defiance\u2019s employees handle a significant amount of funds, as well as financial and personal information. First Defiance also depends upon third-party vendors who have access to funds and personal information about customers. Cybersecurity breaches of other companies, such as the breach of the systems of a credit bureau, may result in criminals using personal information obtained from such other source to impersonate a customer of First Defiance and obtain funds from customer accounts. Further, First Defiance may be affected by data breaches at retailers and other third parties who participate in data interchanges with First Defiance\u2019s customers that involve the theft of customer credit and debit card data, which may include the theft of debit card personal identification numbers and commercial card information used to make purchases at such retailers and other third parties. Such data breaches could result in First Defiance incurring significant expenses to reissue debit cards and cover losses, which could result in a material adverse effect on First Defiance\u2019s results of operations.\nAlthough First Defiance has implemented systems to minimize the risk of fraudulent taking or misuse of funds or information, there can be no assurance that such systems will be adequate or that a taking or misuse of funds or information by employees, by third parties who have authorized access to funds or information, or by third parties who are able to access funds or information without authorization will never occur. First Defiance could be held liable for such an event and could also be subject to regulatory sanctions. First Defiance could also incur the expense of developing additional controls and investing in additional equipment or contracts to prevent future such occurrences. Although First Defiance has insurance to cover such potential losses, First Defiance cannot provide assurance that such insurance will be adequate to meet any liability, and insurance premiums may rise substantially if First Defiance suffers such an event. In addition, any loss of trust or confidence placed in First Defiance by our customers could result in a loss of business, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, or result in a loss of investor confidence, hurting First Defiance\u2019s stock price and ability to acquire capital in the future. First Defiance could also lose revenue by the wrongful appropriation of confidential information about its business operations by competitors who use the information to compete with First Defiance.\nFirst Defiance could suffer a material adverse impact from interruptions in the effective operation of, or security breaches affecting, First Defiance\u2019s computer systems.\nFirst Defiance relies heavily on its own information systems and those of vendors to conduct business and to process, record, and monitor transactions. Risks to the system could result from a variety of factors, including the potential for bad acts on the part of hackers, criminals, employees and others. As one example, some banks have experienced denial of service attacks in which individuals or organizations flood the bank\u2019s website with extraordinarily high volumes of traffic, with the goal and effect of disrupting the ability of the bank to process transactions. Other businesses have been victims of a ransomware attack in which a business becomes unable to access its own information and is presented with a demand to pay a ransom in order to once again have access to its information. First Defiance is also at risk for the impact of natural disasters, terrorism and international hostilities on its systems or for the effects of outages or other failures involving power or communications systems operated by others. These risks also arise from the same types of threats to businesses with which First Defiance deals.\nPotential adverse consequences of attacks on First Defiance\u2019s computer systems or other threats include damage to First Defiance\u2019s reputation, loss of customer business, costs of incentives to customers or business partners in order to maintain their relationships, loss of investor confidence and a reduction in First Defiance\u2019s stock price, litigation, increased regulatory scrutiny and potential enforcement actions, repairs of system damage, increased investments in cybersecurity (such as obtaining additional technology, making organizational changes, deploying additional personnel, training personnel and engaging consultants), and increased insurance premiums, all of which could result in financial loss and material adverse effects on First Defiance\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nIf First Defiance forecloses on collateral property resulting in First Defiance\u2019s ownership of the underlying real estate, First Defiance may be subject to the increased costs associated with the ownership of real property, resulting in reduced income.\nA significant portion of First Defiance\u2019s loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, First Defiance may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, First Defiance may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage.\nIn addition, when First Defiance forecloses on real property, the amount First Defiance realizes after a default is dependent upon factors outside of First Defiance\u2019s control, including, but not limited to, economic conditions, neighborhood real estate values, interest rates, real estate taxes, operating expenses of the mortgaged properties, zoning laws, governmental rules, regulations and fiscal policies, and acts of God. Certain expenditures associated with the ownership of real estate, principally real estate taxes and maintenance costs, may adversely affect the income from the real estate. Therefore, the cost of operating real property may exceed the rental income earned from such property, and First Defiance may have to sell the property at a loss. The foregoing expenditures could adversely affect First Defiance\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nFirst Defiance\u2019s business strategy focuses on planned growth, including strategic acquisitions, and its financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if First Defiance fails to grow or fails to manage its growth effectively.\nFirst Defiance\u2019s ability to grow successfully will depend on a variety of factors, including the continued availability of desirable business opportunities, its ability to integrate mergers and other acquisitions and manage growth and First Defiance\u2019s ability to raise capital. There can be no assurance that growth opportunities will be available.\nFirst Defiance may acquire other financial institutions or parts of institutions in the future, open new branches, and consider new lines of business and new products or services. Expansions of its business would involve a number of expenses and risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe time and costs associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions or expansions into new markets;\n\u2022\nthe potential inaccuracy of estimates and judgments used to evaluate the business and risks with respect to target institutions;\n\u2022\nthe time and costs of hiring local management and opening new offices;\n\u2022\nthe delay between commencing making acquisitions or engaging in new activities and the generation of profits from the expansion;\n\u2022\nFirst Defiance\u2019s ability to finance an expansion and the possible dilution to existing shareholders;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention to the expansion;\n\u2022\nmanagement\u2019s lack of familiarity with new market areas;\n\u2022\nthe integration of new products and services and new personnel into First Defiance\u2019s existing business;\n\u2022\nthe incurrence and possible impairment of goodwill associated with an acquisition and effects on First Defiance\u2019s results of operations; and\n\u2022\nthe risk of loss of key employees and customers.\nIf First Defiance\u2019s growth involves the acquisition of companies through mergers or other acquisitions, the success of such acquisitions will depend on, among other things, First Defiance\u2019s ability to combine the businesses in a manner that permits growth opportunities and cost efficiencies, and does not cause inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the ability of First Defiance to maintain relationships with customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions.\nFailure to manage First Defiance\u2019s growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on its business, future prospects, financial condition or results of operations and could adversely affect First Defiance\u2019s ability to successfully implement its business strategy.\nFirst Defiance\u2019s ability to pay dividends is subject to regulatory limitations which, to the extent First Defiance requires such dividends in the future, may affect its ability to pay dividends or repurchase its stock.\nFirst Defiance is a separate legal entity from First Federal and does not have significant operations of its own. Dividends from First Federal provide a significant source of capital for First Defiance. The availability of dividends from First Federal is limited by various statutes and regulations. The federal and state banking regulators require that insured financial institutions and their holding companies should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings. It is possible, depending upon the financial condition of First Federal and other factors, that First Federal\u2019s primary regulator could assert that the payment of dividends or other payments by First Federal are an unsafe or unsound practice. In the event First Federal is unable to pay dividends to First Defiance, First Defiance may not be able to pay its obligations as they become due, repurchase its stock, or pay dividends on its common stock. Consequently, the potential inability to receive dividends from First Federal could adversely affect First Defiance\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nFailure to integrate or adopt new technology may undermine First Defiance\u2019s ability to meet customer demands, leading to adverse effects on First Defiance\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. First Defiance\u2019s future success depends, in part, upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in operations. First Defiance may not be able to effectively implement or have the resources to implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could adversely affect First Defiance\u2019s business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nA transition away from LIBOR as a reference rate for financial contracts could negatively affect First Defiance\u2019s income and expenses and the value of various financial contracts.\nLIBOR is used extensively in the U.S. and globally as a reference rate for various commercial and financial contracts, including adjustable rate mortgages, corporate debt, interest rate swaps and other derivatives. In 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority announced that in 2021 it would no longer compel banks to submit rates required to calculate LIBOR. Therefore, it is uncertain at this time to what extent banks will continue to provide submissions for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021.\nAs a result of this announcement, regulators, industry groups and certain committees (e.g., the Alternative Reference Rates Committee) have, among other things, published recommended fallback language for LIBOR-linked financial instruments, identified and recommended alternatives for LIBOR rates (e.g., the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as the recommended alternative to U.S. Dollar LIBOR) and proposed implementations of the recommended alternatives in floating rate instruments, including loans and derivatives. It is currently unknown whether these recommendations and proposals will be broadly accepted, whether they will continue to evolve, and what effect of their implementation may have on the markets for floating-rate financial instruments. Any discontinuance, modification, alternative reference rates or other reforms may adversely affect interest rates on our current or future indebtedness and other financial instruments.\nFirst Federal has a significant number of loans, derivative contracts, borrowings and other financial instruments, and continues to enter into loans, derivatives contracts, borrowings and other financial instruments, with attributes that are directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR. The transition from LIBOR could create considerable costs and additional risk for First Defiance. Since proposed alternative rates are calculated differently, payments under contracts referencing new rates will differ from those referencing LIBOR.
