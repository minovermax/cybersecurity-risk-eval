{"cik": "84748", "company": "ROGERS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business, results of operations and financial position are subject to various risks, including those discussed below, which may affect the value of our capital stock. The following risk factors, which we believe represent the most significant factors that may make an investment in our capital stock risky, may cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. You should carefully consider these factors, as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the information set forth in \u201cItem 1. Business - Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Position,\u201d when evaluating an investment in our capital stock.\nRisks Relating to the DuPont Merger\nWe may not be able to complete the proposed merger with DuPont and we may incur substantial costs that may adversely affect our financial results and operations and the market price of our capital stock.\nAdoption of the merger agreement is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of foreign and domestic regulatory approvals, which may not be fulfilled in a timely manner or at all, and accordingly, the merger may not be completed. In addition, the parties can mutually decide to terminate the merger agreement, or Rogers or DuPont may unilaterally elect to terminate the merger agreement under certain circumstances. If the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, we may be required to pay a $135.0 million termination fee to DuPont. If the proposed merger with DuPont is not completed, the price of our capital stock may decline to the extent that the current market price of our capital stock reflects a market assumption that the merger will be completed. Additionally, if the merger is not completed, we may experience negative reactions from financial markets and our suppliers, customers and employees. Each of these factors may adversely affect the trading price of our capital stock, as well as our results and operations and financial condition. Several lawsuits relating to the merger have been filed, as discussed further in \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings.\u201d Rogers and DuPont may be subject to additional lawsuits challenging the merger, and adverse rulings in these lawsuits may delay or prevent the merger from being completed or require Rogers or DuPont to incur significant costs to defend or settle these lawsuits. Any delay in completing the merger could cause us not to realize, or be delayed in realizing, some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve if the merger is successfully completed within the anticipated time frame.\nWhile the proposed merger is pending, we will be subject to contractual restrictions that could adversely affect our business and operations.\nThe merger agreement with DuPont restricts us from taking specified actions without DuPont\u2019s consent until the merger is completed or the merger agreement is terminated, including making certain significant acquisitions or investments, incurring certain indebtedness, making non-ordinary course capital expenditures in excess of certain thresholds, amending or modifying certain material contracts, divesting certain assets, and making certain non-ordinary course changes to personnel and employee compensation. These restrictions, and others more fully described in the merger agreement, may affect our ability to execute our business strategies and attain our financial and other goals and may impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nUncertainties related to the merger could adversely affect our businesses, sales and gross margins.\nIn response to the announcement of the merger or due to ongoing uncertainty about the merger, customers may delay or defer purchasing decisions or elect to switch to other suppliers. In particular, prospective customers could be reluctant to purchase our products and services due to uncertainty about the direction of our offerings and willingness to support our products. To the extent that the merger creates uncertainty among those persons and organizations contemplating purchases such that one large customer, or a significant group of smaller customers, delays, defers or changes purchases in connection with the planned merger, our revenues could be adversely affected. We may make assurances to customers to address their uncertainty about the direction of our products and related support offerings, which may result in additional obligations. In addition, the announcement of the merger may cause prospective customers to delay or defer purchasing decisions resulting in a decline in our net sales, which could have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Our quarterly net sales and net income could be substantially below expectations of market analysts, potentially resulting in a decline in our stock price. We may also experience negative reactions from the Company\u2019s employees, suppliers, vendors, or regulators. Additionally, matters relating to the merger will require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management and the expenditure of significant funds in the form of fees and expenses, which would otherwise have been devoted to day-to-day operations and other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us as an independent company.\nRisks Relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and global responsive measures have impacted our business and results of operations and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position in future periods.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to have global impacts and has resulted in governmental authorities implementing numerous responsive measures, such as travel bans and other restrictions, including quarantines, shelter-in-place and stay-home\norders, transportation disruptions, closures and shutdowns. We maintain significant manufacturing and administrative operations in the U.S., China, Belgium, Germany, England, South Korea and Hungary, and each of these countries has been significantly affected by the outbreak and taken measures to try to contain it and to distribute vaccines as they are approved. We have also modified our business practices in an effort to ensure business continuity while promoting continued employee health and well-being. Collectively, these measures have impacted and are likely to continue to impact our workforce and operations. In addition, the outbreak and associated responsive measures have resulted in significant disruption of the global economy, including increased volatility in financial markets, supply chains and demand for certain goods and services, as well as significant intervention and stimulus measures by governments.\nThere is considerable uncertainty regarding the effect of COVID-19 as well as current and future responsive measures on our business, including on our workforce and operations. We may experience sustained demand reductions for our products in certain end markets, be unable to satisfy customer demand and face increased operating costs, asset impairments and cash flow reductions, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.\nRisks Relating to Our Business, Strategy and Operations\nFailure to capitalize on, volatility within, or other adverse changes with respect to the Company\u2019s growth drivers, including advanced mobility and advanced connectivity, may adversely affect our business.\nWe derived approximately 28% and 19% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2021 from sales relating to the key market growth drivers of advanced mobility and advanced connectivity, respectively. These growth drivers are served by our direct and indirect customers in a variety of markets, including automotive (i.e., ADAS) and EV/HEV, wireless infrastructure and portable electronics. These growth drivers, as well as specific market and industry trends within them, may be volatile, cyclical and sensitive to a variety of factors, including general economic conditions (including higher inflation and interest rates), demand disruptions (including third-party component availability at our customers), technology disruptions, consumer preferences and political priorities. Adverse or cyclical changes to and within these growth drivers, such as delays in adoption or implementation of new technologies, has resulted in, and may continue to result in, reduced demand for certain of our products, production overcapacity, increased inventory levels and related risks of obsolescence, as well as price erosion, ultimately leading to a decline in our operating results. Acceleration within these growth drivers and corresponding rapid increases in demand for certain products may also require us to make significant capital investments or acquisitions in facilities and information systems and significantly increase our personnel in order to increase production levels and to maintain customer relationships and market positions. However, we may not be able to increase our production levels with sufficient speed or efficiency to capitalize on such increases in demand.\nWe have extensive international operations, and events and circumstances that have general international consequence or specific impact in the countries in which we operate may materially adversely affect our business.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 72% of our net sales resulted from sales in foreign markets, with approximately 47% and 24% of such net sales occurring in Asia and Europe, respectively. We expect our net sales in foreign markets to continue to represent a substantial majority of our consolidated net sales. We maintain significant manufacturing and administrative operations in China, Belgium, Germany, England, South Korea and Hungary, and approximately 60% of our employees were located outside the U.S. as of December 31, 2021. Risks related to our extensive international operations include the following:\n\u2022foreign currency fluctuations, particularly in the value of the euro, the Chinese renminbi, the South Korean won, the British pound, the Japanese yen and the Hungarian forint against the U.S. dollar;\n\u2022economic and political instability due to regional or country-specific events or changes in relations between the U.S. and the countries in which we operate;\n\u2022accounts receivable practices across countries, including longer payment cycles;\n\u2022export control or customs matters, including tariffs and trade restrictions;\n\u2022changes in multilateral and bilateral trade relations\n\u2022complications in complying, and failure to comply, with a variety of laws and regulations applicable to our foreign operations, including due to unexpected changes in the laws or regulations of the countries in which we operate;\n\u2022failure to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other applicable anti-corruption laws;\n\u2022greater difficulty protecting our intellectual property;\n\u2022compliance with foreign employment regulations, as well as work stoppages and labor and union disputes.\nThe foregoing risks may be particularly acute in emerging markets such as China, where our operations are subject to greater uncertainty due to increased volatility associated with the developing nature of the economic, legal and governmental systems of these countries, changes in bilateral and multilateral arrangements with the U.S. and other governments, and challenges that some multinational customers that are headquartered in emerging markets may have complying fully with U.S. and other developed market extraterritorial regulations. In addition, our business has been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by the lack of development, or disruptions, of transportation or other critical infrastructure, including wireless infrastructure, in emerging markets. If we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with expanding our global business, or to\nadequately manage operational fluctuations, it may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position.\nDeteriorating trade relations between the U.S. and China, other trade conflicts and barriers, economic sanctions, and Chinese policies to decrease dependence on foreign suppliers could limit or prevent certain existing or potential customers from doing business with us and materially adversely affect our business.\nThe increased trade conflicts between the U.S. and its major trading partners, evidenced by trade restrictions such as tariffs, taxes, export controls, economic sanctions, and enhanced policies designed to protect national security, could adversely impact our business. In particular, we have experienced and expect that we may in the future experience impacts on our business due to the increase in trade conflicts between the U.S. and China. The May 2019 U.S. Department of Commerce addition of Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. (Huawei) to its \u201centity list,\u201d and subsequently implemented Foreign Direct Products Rules, limited the ability of U.S. and foreign companies to export products and license technologies to Huawei. Such export controls, as well as retaliatory controls and tariffs that China has imposed and which remain in place to a certain extent under the Phase 1 agreement reached between the U.S. and China on January 15, 2020, could continue to restrict our ability to do business with Chinese customers. Further U.S. government actions to protect domestic economic and security interests could lead to further restrictions. China continues to be a fast-developing market, and an area of potential growth for us. Sales to customers located in China and the Asia Pacific region have typically accounted for nearly half of our total sales and a substantial majority of our overall sales to customers located outside the U.S. In addition, certain of the end products created in China that incorporate our products are ultimately sold outside of the Asia Pacific region. We expect that revenue from these sales generally, and sales to China and the Asia Pacific region specifically, will continue to be a material component of our total revenue. Therefore, any financial crisis, trade war or dispute or other major event causing business disruption in international jurisdictions generally, and China and the Asia Pacific region in particular, could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial position.\nChina\u2019s stated policy of reducing its dependence on foreign manufacturers and technology companies has resulted and may continue to result in reduced demand for our products in China. These trends, combined with supply chain disruptions caused by COVID-19, may lead to increased decoupling of the supply chains for U.S. and Chinese economies, thereby leading to reduced market opportunities and disrupted supply chains for U.S. companies with sales and operations in China. Increased geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China would likely accelerate these trends. Both countries could pursue policies to reduce their dependence on foreign goods. Such policies could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial position. In addition, as a consequence of such policies, there are risks that the Chinese government may, among other things, require the use of local suppliers, compel companies that do business in China to partner with local companies to conduct business, or provide incentives to government-backed local customers to buy from local suppliers rather than companies like ours, all of which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial position.\nOur business is dependent upon our development of innovative products and our customers\u2019 incorporation of those products into end user products and systems that achieve commercial success.\nAs a manufacturer and supplier of engineered materials and components, our business depends upon our ability to innovate and sell our materials and components for inclusion in other products that are developed, manufactured and sold by our customers. We strive to differentiate our products and secure long-term demand through our engagement with our customers to design in our materials and components as part of their product development processes. The value of any design-in largely depends upon the decision of our customers to manufacture their products or systems in sufficient production quantities, the commercial success of the end product and the extent to which the design of our customers\u2019 products or systems could accommodate substitution of competitor products. A consistent failure to introduce new products in a timely manner, achieve design-ins or achieve market acceptance on commercially reasonable terms could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position. The introduction of new products presents particularly significant business challenges in our business because product development commitments and expenditures must be made well in advance of product sales.\nOur dependence on sole or limited source suppliers for certain of our raw materials could materially adversely affect our ability to manufacture products and materially increase our costs.\nWe rely on sole and limited source suppliers for certain of the raw materials that are critical to the manufacturing of our products. This reliance subjects us to risks related to our potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required raw materials, particularly given our use of lean manufacturing and just-in-time inventory techniques, and our reduced control over pricing and timing of delivery of raw materials. Our operating results could be materially adversely affected if we were unable to obtain adequate supplies of these materials in a timely manner or if their cost increased significantly.\nWhile we believe we could obtain and qualify alternative sources for most sole and limited source supplier materials if necessary, the transition time could be long, particularly if the change requires us to redesign our systems. Ultimately, we may be unable to redesign our systems, which could further increase delays or prevent us from manufacturing our products at all. Even if a system redesign is feasible, increased costs associated with such a redesign would decrease our profit margins, perhaps materially, if we could not effectively pass such costs along to our customers. Further, it would likely result in\nproduction and delivery delays, which could lead to lost sales and damage to our relationships with current and potential customers.\nWe face intense global competition, which could reduce demand for our products or create additional pricing pressure on our products.\nWe operate in a highly competitive global environment and compete with domestic and international companies principally on the basis of the following:\n\u2022innovation;\n\u2022historical customer relationships;\n\u2022product quality, reliability, performance and price;\n\u2022technical and engineering service and support;\n\u2022breadth of product line; and\n\u2022manufacturing capabilities.\nOur competitors include commodity materials suppliers, which offer product substitutions based mostly on price, and suppliers of alternate solutions, which offer product substitutions or eliminations based mostly on disruptive technology. Certain of these competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have and, in some cases, these competitors are well established in specific product niches. We expect that our competitors will continue to improve the design and performance of their products, which could result in the development of products that offer price or performance features superior to our products. Furthermore, our customers may engage in internal manufacturing of products that may result in reduced demand for our products. If we are unable to maintain our competitive advantage for any reason, demand for our products may be materially reduced, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position.\nWe have engaged in transactions in the past and may in the future acquire or dispose of businesses, or engage in other transactions, which expose us to a variety of risks that could materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial position.\nFrom time to time, we have explored and pursued transaction opportunities that we believe complement our core businesses, and we expect to do so again in the future. We have also divested and may again consider divesting businesses or assets that we do not regard as part of our core businesses. These transaction opportunities may come in the form of acquisitions, joint ventures, investments, divestitures or other structures. There are risks associated with such transactions, including, without limitation, general business risk, technology risk, market acceptance risk, litigation risk, environmental risk, regulatory approval risk and risks associated with the failure to complete announced transactions. In the case of acquisitions, we may not be able to discover, during the due diligence process or otherwise, all known and unknown risks associated with the business we are acquiring, including the existence of liabilities. We may spend a significant portion of available cash, incur substantial debt or issue equity securities, which would dilute current shareholders\u2019 equity ownership, to pay for the acquisitions. In addition, if we are unsuccessful in integrating any acquired company or business into our operations or if integration is more difficult than anticipated, we may experience disruptions that could harm our business and result in our failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions. In the case of divestitures, we may agree to indemnify acquiring parties for known or unknown liabilities arising from the businesses we are divesting. We have incurred, and may in the future incur, significant costs in the pursuit and evaluation of transactions that we do not consummate for a variety of reasons.\nAs a result, these transactions may not ultimately create value for us or our shareholders and may harm our reputation and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position.\nThe failure to attract and retain specialized technical and management personnel could impair our expected growth and future success.\nWe depend upon the continued services and performance of key executives, senior management and skilled technical personnel, particularly our sales engineers and other professionals with significant experience in the key industries we serve. Competition for these personnel from other companies, academic institutions and government entities is intense, and our expected growth and future success will depend, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain these individuals.\nIf we suffer loss or disruption to our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems or information technology systems due to catastrophe or other events, our business could be seriously harmed.\nOur facilities, supply chains, distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss or disruption due to fire, flood, earthquake, hurricane, public health crisis, war, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters or events. If any of these facilities, supply chains or systems were to experience a catastrophic loss or disruption, it could disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in defective products or services, damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal exposure and large repair or replacement expenses. For instance, the COVID-19 pandemic and related quarantines and work and travel restrictions have disrupted, and may continue to disrupt, production of and demand for certain of our products. Additionally, there was a fire at our UTIS manufacturing facility in Ansan, South Korea in early\nFebruary 2021, which resulted in extensive damage to the manufacturing site. While some commercial operations resumed in late 2021, with the launch of a replacement production line at one of our Suzhou, China facilities, as we have not yet resumed commercial operations in South Korea. The extent to which these events will affect our results of operations and financial position remains uncertain. The third-party insurance coverage that we maintain will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on cost, availability and our decisions regarding risk retention, and may be unavailable or insufficient to protect us against losses or disruptions.\nA significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems or violations of data protection laws could materially adversely affect our business and reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we collect and store confidential information, including proprietary business information belonging to us, our customers, suppliers, business partners and other third parties and personally identifiable information of our employees. We rely on information technology systems to protect this information and to keep financial records, process orders, manage inventory, coordinate shipments to customers, and operate other critical functions. Our information technology systems are susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, systems upgrades (including the planned implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system) and user errors. If we experience a disruption in our information technology systems, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe are also subject to security breaches caused by computer viruses, illegal break-ins or hacking, sabotage, or acts of vandalism by disgruntled employees or third parties. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyberattack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased, in part because of evolving technologies, the ubiquitous use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies (including mobile devices) to conduct business transactions. Our information technology network and systems have been and, we believe, continue to be under constant attack. Accordingly, despite our security measures or those of our third-party service providers, we have experienced and may in the future experience security breaches, including breaches that we may not be able to detect. Security breaches of our information technology systems, including through mobile devices, could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our customers, suppliers, business partners, employees or other third parties, which could result in our suffering significant financial and reputational damage. If we are unable to protect sensitive information, our customers or governmental authorities could question the adequacy of our security processes and procedures and our compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including evolving government cyber security requirements for government contractors.\nIn addition, the processing and storage of certain information is increasingly subject to privacy and data security regulations, and many such regulations are country-specific. The interpretation and application of data protection laws in the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act, are uncertain, evolving and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions. Compliance with these various laws may be onerous and require us to incur substantial costs or to change our business practices in a manner that adversely affects our business, while failure to comply with such laws may subject us to substantial penalties.\nEmployee benefit cost increases could reduce our profitability.\nOur profitability is affected by employee benefit costs, particularly medical and other employee benefits. In recent years, employee medical costs have increased due to factors such as the increase in health care costs in the U.S. These factors will continue to put pressure on our business and financial performance, as employee benefit costs continue to escalate. We may not succeed in limiting future cost increases. Continued employee benefit cost increases could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nLegal, Compliance and Regulatory Risks\nOur business may be materially adversely affected if we cannot protect our proprietary technology or if we infringe the proprietary rights of others.\nOur proprietary technology supports our ability to compete effectively with other companies, and we seek to protect our intellectual property rights by obtaining domestic and foreign patents, trademarks and copyrights, and maintaining trade secrets for our manufacturing processes. It is possible, however, that our efforts to obtain such protection in the U.S. and abroad will be unsuccessful or that the protection afforded will not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology.\nEven if domestic and foreign laws do grant initial protection to our technology, our competitors or other third parties may subsequently obtain and unlawfully copy, use or disclose our technologies, products, and processes. We believe that the risk of piracy of our technology is particularly acute in the foreign countries in which we operate. In circumstances in which we conclude that our proprietary technology has been infringed, we have pursued, and may again pursue, litigation to enforce our rights. The defense and prosecution of intellectual property infringement suits are both costly and time consuming, even if the outcome is favorable to us. If we are not successful in protecting our proprietary technology or if the protection afforded to us is\nnot sufficiently broad, our competitors may be able to manufacture and offer products substantially similar to our own, thereby reducing demand for our products and adversely affecting our results of operations and financial position. We may also be adversely affected by, and subject to increased competition as a result of, the normal expiration of our issued patents.\nOur competitors or other third parties may also assert infringement or invalidity claims against us in the future. In addition to the significant costs associated with such suits, as noted above, an adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties and require us to license rights from third parties or cease selling our products. Any of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.\nAs a multinational corporation doing business in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions, changes in tax laws or exposures to additional tax liability could negatively impact our operating results.\nAs a result of the variability and uncertainty in global taxation, we are subject to a wide variety of tax-related risks, any of which could provoke changes in our global structure, international operations or intercompany agreements, which could materially reduce our net income in future periods or result in restructuring costs, increased effective tax rates and other expenses. Given the global nature of our business, a number of factors may increase our effective tax rates or otherwise subject us to additional tax liability, including:\n\u2022decisions to redeploy foreign earnings outside of their country of origin for which we have not previously provided for income taxes;\n\u2022increased scrutiny of our transactions by taxing authorities;\n\u2022changes in the geographic mix of our profits among jurisdictions with differing statutory income tax rates;\n\u2022ability to utilize, or changes in the valuation of, deferred tax assets; and\n\u2022changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof or issuance of new interpretations of laws or regulations applicable to us.\nFor instance, many foreign jurisdictions are actively considering changes to existing tax laws as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project undertaken by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). If these changes are enacted, our tax obligations could increase in countries where we do business or sell our products.\nThe terms of our credit agreement subject us to risks, including potential acceleration of our outstanding indebtedness if we fail to satisfy financial ratios and comply with numerous covenants.\nOur credit agreement contains, and any future debt agreements into which we enter may contain, certain financial ratios and certain restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to incur indebtedness or liens, acquire other businesses, dispose of assets, or make investments. Our ability to make scheduled payments on these borrowings and to satisfy financial ratios may be adversely affected by changes in economic or business conditions beyond our control, while the restrictive covenants to which we are subject may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. Failure to satisfy these financial ratios or to comply with the covenants in our credit agreement would constitute a default. An uncured default with respect to one or more of our covenants could result in outstanding borrowings thereunder being declared immediately due and payable, which may also trigger an obligation to repay other outstanding indebtedness. Any such acceleration of our indebtedness would have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, financial position and results of operations.\nOur credit agreement historically permitted us to borrow euro-currency loans that bear interest based on the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR), plus a specified spread. As announced in March 2021 by the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and LIBOR\u2019s administrator, the publication of the one-week and two-month USD LIBOR maturities and non-USD LIBOR maturities ceased immediately after December 31, 2021, with the remaining USD LIBOR maturities ceasing immediately after June 30, 2023. Certain LIBOR borrowings may now be unavailable. Rogers Corporation and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. entered into an amendment to our credit agreement that provides for a a new benchmark interest rate to replace the discontinued LIBOR reference rates as necessary. There is a risk that this new reference rate may be higher than our projected future LIBOR interest rates, thereby causing the cost of our borrowings to increase.\nWe may be adversely affected by litigation stemming from product liability and other claims.\nOur products may contain defects that we do not detect before sale, which may lead to warranty or damage claims against us or product recalls. We are involved in various unresolved legal matters that arise in the ordinary course of our operations or otherwise, including asbestos-related product liability claims related to our operations before the 1990s. For additional information, refer to \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d and \u201cNote 12 - Commitments and Contingencies\u201d to \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d We maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain claims, but the policy coverage limits may not be adequate or cover a particular loss. Costs associated with, among other things, the defense of, or settlements or judgments relating to, claims against us that are not covered by insurance or that result in settlements in excess of insurance coverage may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position. Irrespective of insurance coverage, claims against us could divert the attention of our senior management and/or result in reputational damage, thereby adversely affecting our business.\nOur projections on the potential exposure and expected insurance coverage relating to our asbestos-related product liability claims are based on a number of assumptions, including the number of new claims to be filed each year, the average cost of disposing of such claims, the length of time it takes to dispose of such claims, coverage issues among insurers and the continuing solvency of various insurance companies, as well as the numerous uncertainties surrounding asbestos litigation in the U.S. To the extent such assumptions are inaccurate, the net liabilities that we have recorded in our financial statements may fail to approximate the losses we could suffer in connection with such claims.\nWe are subject to many environmental laws and regulations as well as potential environmental liabilities that could adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations related to the use, storage, handling, discharge or disposal of certain toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals, gases and other substances used in manufacturing our products. Some of these laws in the U.S. include the Federal Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, Toxic Substances Control Act, and similar state statutes and regulations. In the European Union (EU), we are subject to the EU regulations (and their related national implementing legislation) including the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals, the Regulation on the Classification, Labelling and Packaging of Substances and Mixtures and the Industrial Emissions Directive. Compliance with these laws and regulations could require us to incur substantial expenses, including in connection with the acquisition of new equipment. Any failure to comply with present or future environmental laws, rules and regulations could result in criminal and civil liabilities, fines, suspension of production or cessation of certain operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.\nIn addition, some environmental laws impose liability, sometimes without fault, for investigating and/or cleaning up contamination on, or emanating from, properties currently or formerly owned, leased or operated by us, as well as for damages to property or natural resources and for personal injury arising out of such contamination. Such liability may be joint and several, meaning that we could be held responsible for more than our share of the liability involved, or even the entire liability.
