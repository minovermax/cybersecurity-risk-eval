{"cik": "1289340", "company": "Stereotaxis, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-15", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following uncertainties and factors, among others, could affect future performance and cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward looking statements.\nWe may not generate cash from operations or be able to raise the necessary capital to continue operations.\nWe may require additional funds to meet our operational, working capital and capital expenditure needs in the future. We cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain additional funds on favorable terms or at all. If we cannot raise capital on acceptable terms, we will not be able to, among other things:\n\u25cf maintain customer and vendor relationships;\n\u25cf hire, train and retain employees;\n\u25cf maintain or expand our operations;\n\u25cf enhance our existing products or develop new ones;\n\u25cf respond to competitive pressures; or\n\u25cf service our debt obligations and meet our financial covenants.\nOur failure to do any of these things could result in lower revenue and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, and we may have to curtail or cease operations.\nWe may not be able to continue as a going concern if we do not improve the operating performance of the Company or raise additional capital.\nThe Company has sustained operating losses throughout its corporate history and expects that its 2019 expenses will exceed its 2019 gross margin. The Company expects to continue to incur operating losses and negative cash flows until revenues reach a level sufficient to support ongoing operations or expense reductions are in place. The Company\u2019s liquidity needs will be largely determined by the success of clinical adoption within the installed base of our robotic magnetic system as well as by new placements of capital systems. The Company\u2019s plans for improving the liquidity conditions primarily include its ability to control the timing and spending of its operating expenses and raising additional funds through debt or equity financing.\nThere can be no assurance that any of our plans will be successful or that additional capital will be available to us on reasonable terms, or at all, when needed. If we are unable to improve the operating performance of the Company or if we are unable to obtain sufficient additional capital, it may impair our ability to raise new capital, obtain new customers, and hire and retain employees, which could force us to substantially revise our business plan or cease operations, which may reduce or negate the value of your investment.\nWe may lose key personnel or fail to attract and retain replacement or additional personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on the principal members of our management, as well as our scientific and sales staff. Attracting and retaining qualified personnel will be critical to our success, and competition for qualified personnel is intense. We may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms given the competition for qualified personnel among technology and healthcare companies and universities. The loss of personnel or our inability to attract and retain other qualified personnel could harm our business and our ability to compete. In addition, the loss of members of our scientific staff may significantly delay or prevent product development and other business objectives. A loss of key sales personnel could result in a reduction of revenue. In addition, if we outsource certain employee functions that were formerly handled in-house, our personnel costs could increase.\nHospital decision-makers may not purchase our Niobe, Odyssey, or Vdrive systems or may think that such systems are too expensive.\nTo achieve and grow sales, hospitals must purchase our products, and in particular, our robotic magnetic system. The robotic magnetic system is a novel device, and hospitals and physicians are traditionally slow to adopt new products and treatment practices. In addition, hospitals may delay their purchase or installation decision for the robotic magnetic system based on the disposable interventional devices that have received regulatory clearance or approval. Moreover, the robotic magnetic system is an expensive piece of capital equipment, representing a significant portion of the cost of a new or replacement interventional lab. Although priced significantly below a robotic magnetic system, the Odyssey Solution and Vdrive system are still expensive products. If hospitals do not widely adopt our systems, or if they decide that they are too expensive, we may never become profitable. Any failure to sell as many systems as our business plan requires could also have a seriously detrimental impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flow.\nIf we are unable to fulfill our current purchase orders and other commitments on a timely basis or at all, we may not be able to achieve future sales growth.\nOur backlog, which consists of purchase orders and other commitments, is considered by some investors to be a significant indicator of future performance. Consequently, negative changes to this backlog or its failure to grow commensurate with expectations could negatively impact our future operating results or our share price. Our backlog includes those outstanding purchase orders and other commitments that management believes will result in recognition of revenue upon delivery or installation of our systems. We cannot assure you that we will recognize revenue in any particular period or at all because some of our purchase orders and other commitments are subject to contingencies that are outside our control. In addition, these orders and commitments may be revised, modified or cancelled, either by their express terms, as a result of negotiations or by project changes or delays. System installation is by its nature subject to the interventional lab construction or renovation process which comprises multiple stages, all of which are outside of our control. Although the actual installation of our robotic magnetic system requires only a few weeks, and can be accomplished by either our staff or by subcontractors, successful installation of our system can be subjected to delays related to the overall construction or renovation process. If we experience any failures or delays in completing the installation of these systems, our reputation would suffer and we may not be able to sell additional systems. We have experienced situations in which our purchase orders and other commitments did not result in recognizing revenue from placement of a system with a customer. In addition to construction delays, there are risks that an institution will attempt to cancel a purchase order as a result of subsequent project review by the institution or the departure from the institution of physicians or physician groups who have expressed an interest in purchasing our products.\nDecreases in our backlog have occurred in the past and could occur in the future, causing delays in revenue recognition or even removal of orders and other commitments from our backlog. Such events would have a negative effect on our revenue and results of operations.\nWe will likely experience long and variable sales and installation cycles, which could result in substantial fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations.\nWe anticipate that our robotic magnetic system will continue to have a lengthy sales cycle because it consists of a relatively expensive piece of capital equipment, the purchase of which requires the approval of senior management at hospitals, inclusion in the hospitals\u2019 interventional lab budget process for capital expenditures, and, in some instances, a certificate of need from the state or other regulatory approval. In addition, historically the majority of our Niobe ES systems and Odyssey systems have been delivered less than one year after the receipt of a purchase order from a hospital, with the timing being dependent on the construction cycle for the new or replacement interventional suite in which the equipment will be installed. In some cases, this time frame has been extended further because the interventional suite construction is part of a larger construction project at the customer site (typically the construction of a new building), which may occur with our existing and future purchase orders. We cannot assure you that the time from purchase order to delivery for systems to be delivered in the future will be consistent with our historical experience. Moreover, a global economic slowdown may cause our customers to further delay construction or significant capital purchases, which could further lengthen our sales cycle. This may contribute to substantial fluctuations in our quarterly operating results. As a result, in future quarters our operating results could fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, in which event our stock price would likely decrease.\nThe rate of technological innovation of our products might not keep pace with the rest of the market.\nThe rate of innovation for the market in which our products compete is fast-paced and requires significant resources and innovation. If other products and technologies are developed that compete with, or may compete with, the Niobe, Odyssey and Vdrive systems, it could be difficult for us to maintain our advantages associated with being an early developer of this technology. In addition, connectivity with other devices in the electrophysiology lab is a key driver of value. If the Company is not able to continue to commit sufficient resources to ensure that its products are compatible with other products within the electrophysiology lab, this could have a negative impact on revenue.\nGeneral economic conditions could materially adversely impact us.\nOur operating performance is dependent upon economic conditions in the United States and in other countries in which we operate. Uncertainty about current global economic conditions and future global economic conditions may cause customers to delay purchasing or installation decisions or cancel existing orders. The Niobe ES system, Odyssey Solution and Vdrive system are typically purchased as part of a larger overall capital project and an economic downturn or the lack of a robust recovery might make it more difficult for our customers, including distributors, to obtain adequate financing to support the project or to obtain requisite approvals. Any delay in purchasing decisions or cancellation of purchasing commitments may result in a decrease in our revenues. A credit crisis could further affect our business if key suppliers are unable to obtain financing to manufacture our products or become insolvent and we are unable to manufacture product to meet customer demand. If the United States and global economy becomes sluggish or deteriorates for a longer period than we anticipate, we may experience a material negative decrease on the demand for our products which may, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our revenue, profitability, financial condition, ability to raise additional capital and the market price of our stock.\nPhysicians may not use our products if they do not believe they are safe, efficient and effective.\nWe believe that physicians will not use our products unless they determine that the Niobe ES system and Vdrive system provide a safe, effective and preferable alternative to interventional methods in general use today. If longer-term patient studies or clinical experience indicate that treatment with our system or products is less effective, less efficient or less safe than our current data suggest, our sales would be harmed, and we could be subject to significant liability. Further, unsatisfactory patient outcomes or patient injury could cause negative publicity for our products, particularly in the early phases of product introduction. In addition, physicians may be slow to adopt our products if they perceive liability risks arising from the use of these new products. It is also possible that as our products become more widely used, latent defects could be identified, creating negative publicity and liability problems for us and adversely affecting demand for our products. If physicians do not use our products, we likely will not become profitable or generate sufficient cash to survive as a going concern.\nOur collaborations with fluoroscopy system manufacturers and providers of catheters and electrophysiology mapping systems or other parties may fail, or we may not be able to enter into additional collaborations in the future.\nWe have collaborated with and are continuing to collaborate with fluoroscopy system manufacturers and providers of catheters and electrophysiology mapping systems and other parties to make our instrument control technology compatible with their respective imaging products or disposable interventional devices and to co-develop additional disposable interventional devices for use with our products. A significant portion of our revenue from system sales is derived from these integrated products. The maintenance of these collaborations, or the establishment of equivalent alternatives, is critical to our commercialization efforts. The commercial availability of currently compatible digital imaging fluoroscopy systems is unlikely to continue and efforts are being made to ensure the availability of integrated next generation systems and/or equivalent alternatives; however, we cannot assure as to the timeline of the ongoing availability of such compatible systems or our ability to obtain equivalent alternatives on competitive terms or at all.\nOur product commercialization plans could be disrupted, leading to lower than expected revenue and a material and adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flow, if:\n\u25cf we fail to or are unable to maintain adequate compatibility of our products with the most prevalent imaging products or disposable interventional devices expected by our customers for their clinical practice;\n\u25cf any of our collaboration partners delays or fails in the integration of its technology or new products with our robotic magnetic system;\n\u25cf any of our collaboration partners fails to develop or commercialize the integrated products in a timely manner; or\n\u25cf we become involved in disputes with one or more of our collaboration partners regarding our collaborations.\nSome of our collaborators are large, global organizations with diverse product lines and interests that may diverge from our interests in commercializing our products. Accordingly, our collaborators may not devote adequate resources to our products, or may experience financial difficulties, change their business strategy or undergo a business combination that may affect their willingness or ability to fulfill their obligations to us.\nThe failure of one or more of our collaborations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. In addition, if we are unable to enter into additional collaborations in the future, or if these collaborations fail, our ability to develop and commercialize products could be impacted negatively and our revenue could be adversely affected.\nThe complexity associated with selling, marketing, and distributing products could impair our ability to increase revenue.\nWe currently market our products in the U.S., Europe and the rest of the world through a direct sales force of sales specialists, distributors and sales agents, supported by account managers and clinical specialists who provide training, clinical support, and other services to our customers. If we are unable to effectively utilize our existing sales force or increase our existing sales force in the foreseeable future, we may be unable to generate the revenue we have projected in our business plan. Factors that may inhibit our sales and marketing efforts include:\n\u25cf our inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of qualified sales and marketing personnel;\n\u25cf our inability to accurately forecast future product sales and utilize resources accordingly;\n\u25cf the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to or persuade adequate numbers of hospitals and physicians to purchase and use our products; and\n\u25cf unforeseen costs associated with maintaining and expanding an independent sales and marketing organization.\nIn addition, if we fail to effectively use distributors or contract sales agents for distribution of our products where appropriate, our revenue and profitability would be adversely affected.\nOur marketing strategy is dependent on collaboration with physician \u201cthought leaders.\u201d\nOur research and development efforts and our marketing strategy depend heavily on obtaining support, physician training assistance, and collaboration from highly regarded physicians at leading commercial and research hospitals, particularly in the U.S. and Europe. If we are unable to gain and/or maintain such support, training services, and collaboration or if the reputation or standing of these physicians is impaired or otherwise adversely affected, our ability to market our products and, as a result, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow could be materially and adversely affected.\nPhysicians may not commit enough time to sufficiently learn our system.\nIn order for physicians to learn to use the robotic magnetic system, they must attend structured training sessions in order to familiarize themselves with a sophisticated user interface and they must be committed to learning the technology. Further, physicians must utilize the technology on a regular basis to ensure they maintain the skill set necessary to use the interface. Continued market acceptance could be delayed by lack of physician willingness to attend training sessions, by the time required to complete this training, or by state or institutional restrictions on our ability to provide training. An inability to train a sufficient number of physicians to generate adequate demand for our products could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and cash flow.\nCustomers may choose to purchase competing products and not ours.\nOur products must compete with traditional interventional methods. These methods are widely accepted in the medical community, have a long history of use and do not require the purchase of an additional expensive piece of capital equipment. In addition, many of the medical conditions that can be treated using our products can also be treated with pharmaceuticals or other medical devices and procedures. Many of these alternative treatments are also widely accepted in the medical community and have a long history of use.\nWe are aware of three companies that have commercialized endovascular catheter navigation systems which have been cleared by the FDA for mapping and/or ablation procedures. In addition, we are aware of two companies with an electromagnetic catheter navigation system that has received CE Mark approval in Europe.\nWe face competition from companies that are developing drugs, gene or cellular therapies or other medical devices or procedures to treat the conditions for which our products are intended. The medical device and pharmaceutical industries make significant investments in research and development, and innovation is rapid and continuous. Other companies in the medical device industry continue to develop new devices and technologies for traditional interventional methods.\nIf these or other new products or technologies emerge that provide the same or superior benefits as our products at equal or lesser cost, it could render our products obsolete or unmarketable. In addition, the presence of other competitors may cause potential customers to delay their purchasing decisions, resulting in a longer than expected sales cycle, even if they do not choose our competitors\u2019 products. We cannot be certain that physicians will use our products to replace or supplement established treatments or that our products will be competitive with current or future products and technologies.\nMany of our other competitors also have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources, greater name recognition and a larger base of customers than we do. In addition, as the markets for medical devices develop, additional competitors could enter the market. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competitors. Our revenue would be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and market products that are more effective and less expensive than our products.\nIf the magnetic fields generated by our system are not compatible with, or interfere with, other widely used equipment in the interventional labs, sales of our products would be negatively affected.\nOur robotic magnetic system generates magnetic fields that directly govern the motion of the internal, or working, tip of disposable interventional devices. If other equipment in the interventional labs or elsewhere in a hospital is incompatible with the magnetic fields generated by our system, or if our system interferes with such equipment, we may be required to install additional shielding, which may be expensive and which may not solve the problem. If magnetic interference becomes a significant issue at targeted institutions, it would increase our installation costs at those institutions and could limit the number of hospitals that would be willing to purchase and install our systems, either of which would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nThe use of our products could result in product liability claims that could be expensive, divert management\u2019s attention, and harm our reputation and business.\nOur business exposes us to significant risks of product liability claims. The medical device industry has historically been litigious, and we could face product liability claims if the use of our products were to cause injury or death. The coverage limits of our product liability insurance policies may not be adequate to cover future claims, and we may be unable to maintain product liability insurance in the future at satisfactory rates or adequate amounts. A product liability claim, regardless of its merit or eventual outcome, could divert management\u2019s attention, and result in significant legal defense costs, significant harm to our reputation and a decline in revenue.\nOur costs could substantially increase if we receive a significant number of warranty claims.\nWe generally warrant each of our products against defects in materials and workmanship for a period of 12 months following the installation of our system. If product returns or warranty claims increase, we could incur unanticipated additional expenditures for parts and service. In addition, our reputation and goodwill in the interventional lab market could be damaged. Unforeseen warranty exposure in excess of our established reserves for liabilities associated with product warranties could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nWe have incurred substantial losses in the past and may not be profitable in the future.\nWe have incurred substantial net losses since inception, and we expect to incur losses into the future as we continue the commercialization of our products. We are still in the process of realizing the full potential of the commercialization of our technology, and will need to continue to make improvements to that technology. Moreover, the extent of our future losses and the timing of profitability are highly uncertain. Although we have achieved operating profitability during certain quarters, we may not achieve profitable operations on an annual basis, and if we achieve profitable operations, we may not sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. If we require more time than we expect to generate significant revenue and achieve annual profitability, or if we are unable to sustain profitability once achieved, we may not be able to continue our operations. Our failure to achieve annual profitability or sustain profitability on an annual or quarterly basis could negatively impact the market price of our common stock. Furthermore, even if we achieve significant revenue, we may choose to pursue a strategy of increasing market penetration and presence or expand or accelerate new product development or clinical research activities at the expense of profitability.\nWe may not be able to comply with debt covenants and may have to repay outstanding indebtedness.\nOur current borrowing agreement contains various covenants, including financial covenants under our credit agreement with our primary lender. If we violate our covenants, it could impact our ability to borrow and we could be required to repay any related outstanding debt. We could be unable to make these payments, which could lead to insolvency. Even if we are able to make these payments, it will lead to the lack of availability for additional borrowings under our bank loan agreement due to our borrowing capacity. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants or that we could replace this source of liquidity if these covenants were to be violated and our loans and other borrowed amounts were forced to be repaid.\nOur reliance on contract manufacturers and on suppliers, and in some cases, a single supplier, could harm our ability to meet demand for our products in a timely manner or within budget.\nWe depend on contract manufacturers to produce and assemble certain of the components of our systems and other products such as our electrophysiology catheter advancement device and disposable devices for our Vdrive system. We also depend on various third party suppliers for the magnets we use in our robotic magnetic system and certain components of our Odyssey Solution and Vdrive system. In addition, some of the components necessary for the assembly of our products are currently provided to us by a single supplier, including the magnets for our robotic magnetic system and certain components of our Odyssey Solution, and we generally do not maintain large volumes of inventory. Our reliance on these third parties involves a number of risks, including, among other things, the risk that:\n\u25cf we may not be able to control the quality and cost of our system or respond to unanticipated changes and increases in customer orders;\n\u25cf we may lose access to critical services, materials, or components, resulting in an interruption in the manufacture, assembly and shipment of our systems; and\n\u25cf we may not be able to find new or alternative components for our use or reconfigure our system and manufacturing processes in a timely manner if the components necessary for our system become unavailable.\nIf any of these risks materialize, it could significantly increase our costs and impair product delivery.\nLead times for materials and components ordered by us and our contract manufacturers vary and depend on factors such as the specific supplier, contract terms and demand for a component at a given time. We and our contract manufacturers acquire materials, complete standard subassemblies and assemble fully configured systems based on sales forecasts. If orders do not match forecasts, our contract manufacturers and we may have excess or inadequate inventory of materials and components.\nIn addition, if these manufacturers or suppliers stop providing us with the components or services necessary for the operation of our business, we may not be able to identify alternate sources in a timely fashion. Any transition to alternate manufacturers or suppliers would likely result in operational problems and increased expenses and could delay the shipment of, or limit our ability to provide, our products. We cannot assure you that we would be able to enter into agreements with new manufacturers or suppliers on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Additionally, obtaining components from a new supplier may require a new or supplemental filing with applicable regulatory authorities and clearance or approval of the filing before we could resume product sales. Any disruptions in product flow may harm our ability to generate revenue, lead to customer dissatisfaction, damage our reputation and result in additional costs or cancellation of orders by our customers.\nWe also rely on Biosense Webster and other parties to manufacture a number of disposable interventional devices for use with our robotic magnetic system. If these parties cannot manufacture sufficient quantities of disposable interventional devices to meet customer demand, or if their manufacturing processes are disrupted, our revenue and profitability would be adversely affected.\nRisks associated with international manufacturing and trade could negatively impact the availability and cost of our products because materials used to manufacture our magnets, one of our key system components, are sourced from overseas.\nWe purchase the permanent magnets for our robotic magnetic system from a manufacturer that uses material produced in Japan, and we anticipate that certain of the production work for these magnets will be performed for this manufacturer in China. In addition, our subcontractor purchases magnets for our disposable interventional devices directly from a manufacturer in Japan. Any event causing a significant increase in price or a disruption of imports, including the imposition of import restrictions, could adversely affect our business. The flow of components from our vendors could also be adversely affected by financial or political instability in any of the countries in which the goods we purchase are manufactured, if the instability affects the production or export of product components from those countries. Trade restrictions in the form of tariffs or quotas, or both, could also affect the importation of those product components and could increase the cost and reduce the supply of products available to us. In addition, decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies could increase the cost of products we purchase from overseas vendors.\nWe may encounter problems at our manufacturing facilities or those of our subcontractors or otherwise experience manufacturing delays that could result in lost revenue.\nWe subcontract all or part of the manufacture and assembly of components of our Niobe ES system, Odyssey Solution, and Vdrive system, and all of our disposable devices. The products we design may not satisfy all of the performance requirements of our customers and we may need to improve or modify the design or ask our subcontractors to modify their production process in order to do so. In addition, we or our subcontractors may experience quality problems, substantial costs and unexpected delays related to efforts to upgrade and expand manufacturing, assembly and testing capabilities. If we incur delays due to quality problems or other unexpected events, our revenue may be impacted.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations, compromise confidential information, and expose us to liability which could materially adversely impact our business and reputation.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations; compromise information belonging to us, our employees, customers, and suppliers; and expose us to liability which could adversely impact our business and reputation. In the ordinary course of business, we rely on information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit, and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. Additionally, we collect and store certain data, including proprietary business information and customer and employee data, and may have access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls. Despite our cyber security measures (including employee and third-party training, monitoring of networks and systems, and maintenance of backup and protective systems) which are continuously reviewed and upgraded, our information technology networks and infrastructure may still be vulnerable to damage, disruptions, or shutdowns due to attack by hackers, breaches, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, natural disasters, or other catastrophic events. Any such events could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties under privacy laws, disruption in operations, and damage to our reputation, which could materially adversely affect our business. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats to our information technology networks and infrastructure, to date none of these threats has had a material impact on our business or operations.\nWe may be unable to protect our technology from use by third parties.\nOur commercial success depends in part on obtaining patent and other intellectual property right protection for the technologies contained in our products and on successfully defending these rights against third party challenges. The patent positions of medical device companies, including ours, can be highly uncertain and involve complex and evolving legal and factual questions. We cannot assure you that we will obtain the patent protection we seek, that any protection we do obtain will be found valid and enforceable if challenged or that it will confer any significant commercial advantage. U.S. patents and patent applications may also be subject to interference proceedings and U.S. patents may be subject to re-examination proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and foreign patents may be subject to opposition or comparable proceedings in the corresponding foreign patent office, which proceedings could result in either loss of the patent, or denial of the patent application, or loss or reduction in the scope of one or more of the claims of the patent or patent application. In addition, such interference, re-examination, and opposition proceedings may be costly. Thus, any patents that we own or license from others may not provide any protection against competitors. Our pending patent applications, those we may file in the future, or those we may license from third parties may not result in patents being issued and certain foreign patent applications for medical related devices and methods may be found unpatentable. If issued, they may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology.\nSome of our technology was developed in conjunction with third parties, and thus there is a risk that a third party may claim rights in our intellectual property. Outside the U.S., we rely on third-party payment services for the payment of foreign patent annuities and other fees. Non-payment or delay in payment of such fees, whether intentional or unintentional, may result in loss of patents or patent rights important to our business. Many countries, including certain countries in Europe, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties (for example, the patent owner has failed to \u201cwork\u201d the invention in that country, or the third party has patented improvements). In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of the patent. We also cannot assure you that we will be able to develop additional patentable technologies. If we fail to obtain adequate patent protection for our technology, or if any protection we obtain becomes limited or invalidated, others may be able to make and sell competing products, impairing our competitive position.\nOur trade secrets, nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions to protect unpatented technology provide only limited and possibly inadequate protection of our rights. As a result, third parties may be able to use our unpatented technology, and our ability to compete in the market would be reduced. In addition, employees, consultants and others who participate in developing our products or in commercial relationships with us may breach their agreements with us regarding our intellectual property, and we may not have adequate remedies for the breach.\nOur competitors may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or products that are equal or superior to our technology and products without infringing any of our patent or other intellectual property rights, or may design around our proprietary technologies. Our competitors may acquire similar or even the same technology components that are utilized in our current offering eroding some differentiation in the marketplace. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent, as do the laws of the U.S., particularly in the field of medical products and procedures.\nThird parties may assert that we are infringing their intellectual property rights.\nSuccessfully commercializing our products depends in part on not infringing patents held by third parties. It is possible that one or more of our products, including those that we have developed in conjunction with third parties, infringes existing patents. We may also be liable for patent infringement by third parties whose products we use or combine with our own and for which we have no right to indemnification. In addition, because patent applications are maintained under conditions of confidentiality and can take many years to issue, there may be applications now pending of which we are unaware and which may later result in issued patents that our products infringe. Determining whether a product infringes a patent involves complex legal and factual issues and may not become clear until finally determined by a court in litigation. Our competitors may assert that our products infringe patents held by them. Moreover, as the number of competitors in our market grows the possibility of a patent infringement claim against us increases. If we were not successful in obtaining a license or redesigning our products, we could be subject to litigation. If we lose in this kind of litigation, a court could require us to pay substantial damages or prohibit us from using technologies essential to our products covered by third-party patents. An inability to use technologies essential to our products would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow and could undermine our ability to continue operating as a going concern.\nExpensive intellectual property litigation is frequent in the medical device industry.\nInfringement actions, validity challenges and other intellectual property claims and proceedings, whether with or without merit, can be expensive and time-consuming and would divert management\u2019s attention from our business. We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, substantial costs in obtaining patents and may have to incur substantial costs defending our proprietary rights. Incurring such costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nWe may not be able to maintain all the licenses or rights from third parties necessary for the development, manufacture, or marketing of new and existing products.\nAs we develop additional products and improve or maintain existing products, we may find it advisable or necessary to seek licenses or otherwise make payments in exchange for rights from third parties who hold patents covering certain technology. If we cannot obtain or maintain the desired licenses or rights for any of our products, we could be forced to try to design around those patents at additional cost or abandon the product altogether, which could adversely affect revenue and results of operations. If we have to abandon a product, our ability to develop and grow our business in new directions and markets would be adversely affected. If we do not maintain licenses or exclusivity with suppliers of certain components of our Odyssey Solution, competitors may enter the market, negatively impacting our ability to develop and commercialize the Odyssey Solution.\nOur products and related technologies can be applied in different medical applications, and we may fail to focus on the most profitable areas.\nThe robotic magnetic system is designed to have the potential for expanded applications beyond electrophysiology and interventional cardiology, including congestive heart failure, structural heart repair, interventional neurosurgery, interventional neuroradiology, peripheral vascular, pulmonology, urology, gynecology and gastrointestinal medicine. We continue to develop the Odyssey Solution and Vdrive system for interventional labs that have a robotic magnetic system installed as well as those standard interventional labs that do not have a robotic magnetic system installed. However, we have limited financial and managerial resources and, therefore, may be required to focus on products in selected industries and sites and to forego efforts with regard to other products and industries. Our decisions may not produce viable commercial products and may divert our resources from more profitable market opportunities. Moreover, we may devote resources to developing products in these additional areas but may be unable to justify the value proposition or otherwise develop a commercial market for products we develop in these areas, if any. In that case, the return on investment in these additional areas may be limited, which could negatively affect our results of operations.\nWe may be subject to damages resulting from claims that our employees or we have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nMany of our employees were previously employed at hospitals, universities or other medical device companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. We could, in the future, be subject to claims that these employees or we have used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management. Incurring such costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nIf we or the parties in our strategic collaborations fail to obtain or maintain necessary FDA clearances or approvals for our medical device products, or if such clearances or approvals are delayed, we will be unable to continue to commercially distribute and market our products.\nOur products are medical devices that are subject to extensive regulation in the U.S. and in foreign countries where we do business. Each medical device that we wish to market in the U.S. must be designated as exempt from premarket approval or notification, or first receive either a 510(k) clearance, de novo approval, or a pre-market approval, or PMA, from the U.S. FDA pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&C Act. The FDA\u2019s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from four to 12 months, but it can take longer. The process of obtaining PMA approval is much more costly, lengthy, and uncertain, generally taking from one to three years or even longer. Although we have 510(k) clearance for many of our products, including disposable interventional devices, and we are able to market these products commercially in the U.S., our business model relies significantly on revenue from new disposable interventional devices, some of which may not achieve FDA clearance or approval. We cannot assure you that any of our devices will not be required to undergo the lengthier and more burdensome PMA process. We cannot commercially market any disposable interventional devices in the U.S. until the necessary clearances or approvals from the FDA have been received. In addition, we are working with third parties to co-develop disposable products. In some cases, these companies are responsible for obtaining appropriate regulatory clearance or approval to market these disposable devices. If these clearances or approvals are not received or are substantially delayed or if we are not able to offer a sufficient array of approved disposable interventional devices, we may not be able to successfully market our system to as many institutions as we currently expect, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nFurthermore, obtaining 510(k) clearances, de novo approvals, PMAs or PMA supplement approvals, from the FDA could result in unexpected and significant costs for us and consume management\u2019s time and other resources. The FDA could ask us to supplement our submissions, collect non-clinical data, conduct clinical trials or engage in other time-consuming actions, or it could simply deny our applications. In addition, even if we obtain a 510(k) clearance, de novo approvals, or PMA or PMA supplement approval, the clearance or approval could be revoked or other restrictions imposed if post-market data demonstrates safety issues or lack of effectiveness. We cannot predict with certainty how, or when, the FDA will act on our marketing applications. If we are unable to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals, our financial condition and cash flow may be adversely affected. Also, a failure to obtain approvals may limit our ability to grow domestically and internationally.\nIf our strategic collaborations elect not to or we fail to obtain regulatory approvals in other countries for products under development, we will not be able to commercialize these products in those countries.\nIn order to market our products outside of the U.S., we and our strategic collaborations or distributors must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy. Approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process in other countries may include all of the risks detailed above regarding FDA approval in the U.S. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. Failure to obtain regulatory approval in other countries or any delay or setback in obtaining such approval could have the same adverse effects described above regarding FDA approval in the U.S. In addition, we may rely on our distributors and strategic collaborations, in some instances, to assist us in this regulatory approval process in countries outside the U.S. and Europe, for example, in Japan.\nWe may fail to comply with continuing regulatory requirements of the FDA and other authorities and become subject to enforcement action, which may include substantial penalties.\nEven after product clearance or approval, we must comply with continuing regulation by the FDA and other authorities, including the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, requirements, labeling and promotional requirements and medical device adverse event and other reporting requirements. Any failure to comply with continuing regulation by the FDA or other authorities could result in enforcement action that may include suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, recalling products, ceasing product manufacture and/or marketing, seizure and detention of products, paying significant fines and penalties, criminal prosecution and similar actions that could limit product sales, delay product shipment and harm our profitability. Congress could amend the FD&C Act, and the FDA could modify its regulations promulgated under this law or its policies in a way to make ongoing regulatory compliance more burdensome and difficult.\nAdditionally, any modification to an FDA 510(k) cleared or de novo-approved device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance. Modifications to a PMA approved device or its labeling may require either a new PMA or PMA supplement approval, which could be a costly and lengthy process. In addition, if we are unable to obtain approval for key applications, we may face product market adoption barriers that we cannot overcome. In the future, we may modify our products after they have received clearance or approval, and we may determine that new clearance or approval is unnecessary. We cannot assure you that the FDA would agree with any of our decisions not to seek new clearance or approval. If the FDA requires us to seek clearance or approval for any modification that we determined to not require clearance or approval in the first instance, we could be subject to enforcement sanctions and we also may be required to cease marketing or recall the modified product until we obtain FDA clearance or approval which could also limit product sales, delay product shipment and harm our profitability.\nIn many foreign countries in which we market our products, we are subject to regulations affecting, among other things, product standards, packaging requirements, labeling requirements, import restrictions, tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements. Many of these regulations are similar to those of the FDA or other U.S. regulations. In addition, in many countries the national health or social security organizations require our products to be qualified before procedures performed using our products become eligible for reimbursement. Failure to receive or delays in the receipt of, relevant foreign qualifications could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Due to the movement toward harmonization of standards in Europe, we expect a changing regulatory environment characterized by a shift from a country-by-country regulatory system to a Europe-wide single regulatory system. We cannot predict the timing of this harmonization and its effect on us. Adapting our business to changing regulatory systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to fines, suspension, or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.\nIn addition, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, anti-bribery, antitrust and anti-competition laws, and similar laws in foreign countries. Any violation of these laws by our distributors or agents or by us could create a substantial liability for us and also cause a loss of reputation in the market. From time to time, we may face audits or investigations by one or more government agencies, compliance with which could be costly and time-consuming, and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. An adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could subject us to fines or other penalties, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nOur suppliers, subcontractors, or we may fail to comply with the FDA quality system regulation or other quality standards.\nOur manufacturing processes must comply with the FDA\u2019s QSR, which covers the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of our products. The FDA enforces the QSR through inspections. We cannot assure you that we or our suppliers or subcontractors would pass such an inspection. If we or our suppliers or subcontractors fail to comply with the FDA regulation or EN ISO 13485:2003 standards, we or they may be required to cease all or part of our operations for some period of time until we or they can demonstrate that appropriate steps have been taken to comply with such standards or face other enforcement action, such as a public warning letter, untitled letter, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, seizures, operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production, refusing requests for 510(k) clearance, de novo petitions, or PMA approval of new products, withdrawing 510(k) clearance, de novo approvals, or PMA approvals already granted, and/or criminal prosecution. Furthermore, the European Union recently adopted new EN ISO 13485:2016 standards, with which we must comply no later than April 2019. We cannot assure you that we will be able to timely comply with EN ISO 13485:2016 standards. We cannot be certain that our facilities or those of our suppliers or subcontractors will comply with the FDA, EN ISO 13485:2003, or when applicable, EN ISO 13485:2016 standards in future audits by regulatory authorities. Failure to pass such an inspection could force a shutdown of manufacturing operations, a recall of our products or the imposition of other enforcement sanctions, which would significantly harm our revenue and profitability. Further, we cannot assure you that our key component suppliers are or will continue to be in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and quality standards and will not encounter any manufacturing difficulties. Any failure to comply with the FDA\u2019s QSR, EN ISO 13485:2003 or when applicable, EN ISO 13485:2016, by us or our suppliers could significantly harm our available inventory and product sales. Further, any failure to comply with FDA\u2019s QSR by us or our suppliers could result in FDA refusing requests for and/or delays in 510(k) clearance, de novo approval, or PMA approval of new products.\nSoftware errors or other defects may be discovered in our products.\nOur products incorporate many components, including sophisticated computer software. Complex software frequently contains errors, especially when first introduced. Because our products are designed to be used to perform complex interventional procedures, we expect that physicians and hospitals will have an increased sensitivity to the potential for software defects. We cannot assure you that our software or other components will not experience errors or performance problems in the future. If we experience software errors or performance problems, we would likely also experience:\n\u25cf loss of revenue;\n\u25cf delay in market acceptance of our products;\n\u25cf damage to our reputation;\n\u25cf additional regulatory filings;\n\u25cf product recalls;\n\u25cf increased service or warranty costs; and/or\n\u25cf product liability claims relating to the software defects.\nIf we fail to comply with health care regulations, we could face substantial penalties and our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWhile we do not control referrals of health care services or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors, many health care laws and regulations apply to our business. We are subject to health care fraud and patient privacy regulation by the federal government, the states in which we conduct our business, and internationally. The regulations that may affect our ability to operate include:\n\u25cf the federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal health care programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u25cf federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, and which may apply to entities like us if we provide coding and billing advice to customers;\n\u25cf the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which prohibits executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program or making false statements relating to health care matters and which also imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; and the applicable Privacy and Security Standards of HITECH, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which is Title XIII of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act;\n\u25cf state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, and state laws governing the privacy of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts;\n\u25cf federal self-referral laws, such as the Stark Anti-Referral Law, which prohibits a physician from making a referral to a provider of certain health services with which the physician or the physician\u2019s family member has a financial interest;\n\u25cf federal and state Sunshine laws, which require manufacturers of certain medical devices to collect and report information on payments or transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and\n\u25cf regulations pertaining to receipt of CE mark for our products marketed outside of the United States and submission to periodic regulatory audits in order to maintain these regulatory approvals.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental laws or regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, loss of reimbursement for our products under federal or state government health programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment, or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. The risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expense and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. Moreover, to achieve compliance with applicable federal and state privacy, security, and electronic transaction laws, we may be required to modify our operations with respect to the handling of patient information. Implementing these modifications may prove costly. At this time, we are not able to determine the full consequences to us, including the total cost of compliance, of these various federal and state laws.\nHealthcare policy changes, including legislation enacted in 2010 as well as the potential repeal or amendment of such legislation, may have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn response to perceived increases in health care costs in recent years, there have been and continues to be proposals by the Trump administration, members of Congress, state governments, regulators and third-party payors to control these costs and, more generally, to reform the U.S. healthcare system.\nIn March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). Among other things, the law imposed a tax on medical device manufacturers and producers equal to 2.3% of the sales price for all sales beginning January 1, 2013. This excise tax applies to the majority of our products sold within the United States. Although a two-year moratorium on the excise tax was enacted for 2016 and 2017, and extended for 2018 and 2019, the tax is currently scheduled to resume collection on January 1, 2020. We expect that the PPACA could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and our ability to successfully commercialize our products or could limit or eliminate our spending on certain development projects.\nOn August 2, 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee was charged with identifying a reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021. The Committee did not achieve this target by the imposed deadline, triggering the legislation\u2019s automatic reduction to several government programs. Included in the automatic reduction are aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, starting in 2013.\nChanges to, or repeal of, the PPACA, which the administration and certain members of Congress have affirmatively indicated that they will pursue, could materially and adversely affect our business and financial position, and results of operations. Even if the PPACA is not amended or repealed, the administration could propose changes impacting implementation of the PPACA, which could materially and adversely affect our financial position or operations. However, we cannot currently predict the content, timing or impact that any such future legislation will have on our business.\nThe application of state certificate of need regulations and compliance by our customers with federal and state licensing or other international requirements could substantially limit our ability to sell our products and grow our business.\nSome states require health care providers to obtain a certificate of need or similar regulatory approval prior to the acquisition of high-cost capital items such as our Niobe ES system, Odyssey Solution, or Vdrive system. In many cases, a limited number of these certificates are available. As a result of this limited availability, hospitals and other health care providers may be unable to obtain a certificate of need for the purchase of our systems. Further, our sales and installation cycle for the Niobe ES system is typically longer in certificate of need states due to the time it takes our customers to obtain the required approvals. In addition, our customers must meet various federal and state regulatory and/or accreditation requirements in order to receive payments from government-sponsored health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, receive full reimbursement from third party payors, and maintain their customers. Our international customers may be required to meet similar or other requirements. Any lapse by our customers in maintaining appropriate licensure, certification or accreditation, or the failure of our customers to satisfy the other necessary requirements under government-sponsored health care programs or other requirements could cause our sales to decline.\nHospitals or physicians may be unable to obtain reimbursement from third-party payors for procedures using the Niobe or Vdrive systems, or reimbursement for procedures may be insufficient to recoup the costs of purchasing our products.\nWe expect that U.S. hospitals will continue to bill various third-party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid and other government programs and private insurance plans, for procedures performed with our products, including the costs of the disposable interventional devices used in these procedures. If, in the future, our disposable interventional devices do not fall within U.S. reimbursement categories and our procedures are not reimbursed, or if the reimbursement is insufficient to cover the costs of purchasing our system and related disposable interventional devices, the adoption of our systems and products would be significantly slowed or halted, and we may be unable to generate sufficient sales to support our business. Our success in international markets also depends upon the eligibility of our products for reimbursement through government-sponsored health care payment systems and third-party payors. In both the U.S. and foreign markets, health care cost-containment efforts are prevalent and are expected to continue. These efforts could reduce levels of reimbursement available for procedures involving our products and, therefore, reduce overall demand for our products as well. A failure to generate sufficient sales could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nOur growth may place a significant strain on our resources, and if we fail to manage our growth, our ability to develop, market, and sell our products will be harmed.\nOur business plan contemplates a period of substantial growth and business activity. This growth and activity will likely result in new and increased responsibilities for management personnel and place significant strain upon our operating and financial systems and resources. To accommodate our growth and compete effectively, we will be required to improve our information systems, create additional procedures and controls and expand, train, motivate and manage our work force. We cannot be certain that our personnel, systems, procedures, and controls will be adequate to support our future operations. Any failure to effectively manage our growth could impede our ability to successfully develop, market, and sell our products.\nWe face currency and other risks associated with international operations.\nWe intend to continue to devote significant efforts to marketing our systems and products outside of the U.S. This strategy will expose us to numerous risks associated with international operations, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, including the following:\n\u25cf currency fluctuations that could impact the demand for our products or result in currency exchange losses;\n\u25cf export restrictions, tariff and trade regulations and foreign tax laws;\n\u25cf customs duties, export quotas or other trade restrictions;\n\u25cf economic and political instability; and\n\u25cf shipping delays.\nIn addition, contracts may be difficult to enforce and receivables difficult to collect through a foreign country\u2019s legal system.\nWe are limited by our inability to use a short form registration statement on Form S-3, which may affect our ability to access the capital markets, if needed.\nA Registration Statement on Form S-3 permits an eligible issuer to incorporate by reference its past and future filings and reports made under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. In addition, Form S-3 enables eligible issuers to conduct primary offerings \u201coff the shelf\u201d under Rule 415 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. The shelf registration process under Form S-3 combined with the ability to incorporate information on a forward basis, allows issuers to avoid additional delays and interruptions in the offering process and to access the capital markets in a more expeditious and efficient manner than raising capital in a standard offering on Form S-1.\nTo be eligible to use Form S-3 for a registered offering of our securities to investors, either (1) the aggregate market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates would have to exceed $75 million or (2) our common stock would have to be listed and registered on a national securities exchange. Currently, we do not meet either of those eligibility requirements and are therefore precluded from using a Form S-3 in connection with a registered offering of our securities to investors.\nDue to our present inability to use Form S-3, if we wanted to conduct a registered offering of securities to investors, we will be required to use long form registration and may experience delays. In addition, our ability to undertake certain types of financing transactions may be limited or unavailable to us without the ability to use Form S-3. Furthermore, because of the delay associated with long form registration and the limitations on the financing transactions we may undertake, the terms of any financing transaction we are able to conduct may not be advantageous to us or may cause us not to obtain capital in a timely fashion to execute our business strategies and continue to operate as a going concern.\nRisks Related To Our Common Stock\nOur principal stockholders continue to own a large percentage of our voting stock, and they have the ability to substantially influence matters requiring stockholder approval.\nCertain of our directors and individuals or entities affiliated with them as well as other principal stockholders beneficially own or control a substantial percentage of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Moreover, as a result of the issuance of warrants to certain institutional investors, certain of our directors and their affiliated funds have the ability to obtain a substantial portion of our common stock. Accordingly, these stockholders acting as a group, will have substantial influence over the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets or any other significant corporate transaction. These stockholders may also delay or prevent a change of control, even if such a change of control would benefit our other stockholders. This significant concentration of stock ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock due to investors\u2019 perception that conflicts of interest may exist or arise.\nFuture issuances of our securities could dilute current stockholders\u2019 ownership.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had 41.7 million shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock bearing dividends at a rate of six percent (6.0%) per annum, which are cumulative and accrue daily from the date of issuance on the $1,000 stated value. Such dividends will not be paid in cash, except in connection with any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company or any redemption of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. Instead, the value of the accrued dividends is added to the liquidation preference of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and will increase the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion, which will dilute the ownership of our common stockholders.\nIn addition, a significant number of shares of our common stock are subject to warrants, stock options and stock appreciation rights, and we may request the ability to issue additional such securities. We may also decide to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing to fund our operations. While we cannot predict the effect, if any, that future exercises of warrants or future sales of debt, our common stock, other equity securities or securities convertible into our common stock or other equity securities or the availability of any of the foregoing for future sale, will have on the market price of our common stock, it is likely that sales of substantial amounts of our common stock (including shares issued upon the exercise of warrants, stock options, stock appreciation rights or the conversion of any convertible securities outstanding now or in the future, including the Series A Convertible Preferred Shares), will dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders and that the perception that such sales could occur, will adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nFurther, the Series A Convertible Preferred Shares rank senior to our common stock as to distributions and payments upon the liquidation, dissolution and winding up of the Company. No such distributions or payments upon the liquidation, dissolution and winding up of the Company may be made to holders of common stock unless and until the holders of the Series A Convertible Preferred Shares have received the stated value of $1,000 per share plus any accrued and unpaid dividends. Until all Series A Convertible Preferred Shares have been converted or redeemed, no dividends may be paid on the common stock without the express written consent of the holders of a majority of the outstanding Series A Convertible Preferred Shares. In the event that dividends or other distributions of assets are made or paid by the Company to the holders of the common stock, the holders of Series A Convertible Preferred Shares are entitled to participate in such dividend or distribution on an as-converted basis. Any such distributions or payments upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company may dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders.\nWe have never paid dividends on our capital stock, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have paid no cash dividends on any of our classes of capital stock to date and we currently intend to retain our future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. In addition, the terms of our loan agreement prohibit us from declaring dividends without the prior consent of our lender. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be an investor\u2019s sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws, Delaware law, and one of our collaboration agreements contain provisions that could discourage a takeover.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that might enable our management to resist a takeover. These provisions may:\n\u25cf discourage, delay or prevent a change in the control of our company or a change in our management;\n\u25cf adversely affect the voting power of holders of common stock; and\n\u25cf limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nIn addition, our collaboration agreement with Biosense Webster contains provisions that may similarly discourage a takeover and negatively affect our share price as described above.\nEvolving regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses and continuing uncertainty.\nChanging laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the new SEC regulations such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act have in the past created uncertainty for public companies. We continue to evaluate and monitor developments with respect to new and proposed rules and cannot predict or estimate the amount of the additional compliance costs we may incur or the timing of such costs. These new or changed laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by courts and regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. Maintaining appropriate standards of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in increased general and administrative expense and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. In addition, if we fail to comply with new or changed laws, regulations and standards, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business and reputation may be harmed.\nOur future operating results may be below securities analysts\u2019 or investors\u2019 expectations, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nThe revenue and income potential of our products and our business model are unproven, and we may be unable to generate significant revenue or grow at the rate expected by securities analysts or investors. In addition, our costs may be higher than we, securities analysts, or investors expect. If we fail to generate sufficient revenue or our costs are higher than we expect, our results of operations will suffer, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline. Our results of operations will depend upon numerous factors, including:\n\u25cf demand for our products;\n\u25cf the performance of third-party contract manufacturers and component suppliers;\n\u25cf our ability to develop sales and marketing capabilities;\n\u25cf the success of our strategic relationships with two multinational fluoroscopy system manufacturers and one provider of catheters and electrophysiology mapping systems;\n\u25cf our ability to develop, introduce and market integrated next generation systems and/or alternatives to our current strategic relationships with fluoroscopy system manufacturers and the catheter and electrophysiology mapping system provider on a timely basis;\n\u25cf our ability to develop, introduce and market new or enhanced versions of our products on a timely basis;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain regulatory clearances or approvals for our new products; and\n\u25cf our ability to obtain and protect proprietary rights.\nOur operating results in any particular period may not be a reliable indication of our future performance. In some future quarters, our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. If this occurs the price of our common stock will likely decline.\nNasdaq delisted our common stock from The Nasdaq Capital Market and our common stock began trading on the OTCQX\u00ae Best Market in August 2016. Trading of our shares on the over-the-counter markets could negatively impact the liquidity of our common stock and our ability to access the capital markets and, in turn, could impair the value of your investment.\nOn August 4, 2016, trading in our common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) was suspended as a result of a determination from Nasdaq to delist our common stock due to our failure to meet certain applicable requirements. On August 4, 2016, shares of our common stock commenced trading on the OTCQX\u00ae Best Market under the Company\u2019s existing ticker symbol of \u201cSTXS.\u201d Trading of our shares on the over-the-counter markets could negatively impact the liquidity of our common stock and our ability to access the capital markets, which could impair the value of your investment.\nThe trading of our common stock on the over-the-counter market, including the OTCQX\u00ae Best Market, may adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock, limit our ability to issue additional securities (including pursuant to registration statements on Form S-3) and adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations, which could harm our business or cause us to cease operations.\nFurthermore, our common stock may not continue to trade on the OTCQX\u00ae Best Market in the future, broker-dealers may cease to provide public quotes of our common stock on this market, or the trading volume of our common stock may be insufficient to provide for an efficient trading market. Any such developments could impair the value of your investment.\nWe expect that the price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially, possibly resulting in class action securities litigation.\nOur common stock is traded on the OTCQX\u00ae Best Market and trading volume may be limited or sporadic. The market price of our common stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, substantial volatility. During 2018, our common stock traded between $0.51 and $1.65 per share, on trading volume ranging from approximately 0 to 0.3 million shares per day. The market price of our common stock will be affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors;\n\u25cf the receipt or denial of regulatory approvals;\n\u25cf announcements of new products, technological innovations or product advancements by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf developments with respect to patents and other intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts or our failure to achieve analyst earnings estimates;\n\u25cf developments in our industry; and\n\u25cf participants in the market for our common stock may take short positions with respect to our common stock.\nThese factors, as well as general economic, credit, political and market conditions, may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock. As with the stock of many other public companies, the market price of our common stock has been particularly volatile during the recent period of upheaval in the capital markets and world economy. This excessive volatility may continue for an extended period of time following the filing date of this report. Furthermore, the stock prices of many companies in the medical device industry have experienced wide fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. Volatility in the price of our common stock on the OTCQX\u00ae Best Market may depress the trading price of our common stock, which could, among other things, allow a potential acquirer of the Company to purchase a significant amount of our common stock at low prices. In addition, the volatility of our stock price could lead to class action securities litigation being filed against us, which could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management resources, which could significantly harm our business.", "PERMNO": 90325, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "STXS"}
