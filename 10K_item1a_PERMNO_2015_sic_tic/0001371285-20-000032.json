{"cik": "1371285", "company": "TRUPANION, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this report, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, as well as in our other filings with the SEC, in evaluating our business and before investing in our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not expressly stated, that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that affect us. If any of the following risks occur, our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects could be materially harmed. In that event, the price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe have incurred significant cumulative net losses since our inception and may not be able to maintain profitability in the future.\nWe have incurred significant cumulative net losses since our inception. We incurred net losses of $1.8 million and $0.9 million in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and as of December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $85.5 million. We have funded our operations through equity financings, borrowings under a revolving line of credit and term loans and, since 2016, positive cash flows from operations. Our ability to maintain profitability will depend in significant part on our obtaining new members, retaining our existing members and ensuring that our expenses, including our sales and marketing expenses, does not exceed our revenue. We expect to make significant expenditures and investments in member acquisition. Our recent growth in revenue and membership may not be sustainable or may decrease, and we may not generate sufficient revenue to maintain profitability. Additionally, we budget for our expenses based, in significant part, on our estimates of future revenue and many of these expenses are fixed in the short term. As a result, we may be unable to adjust our spending in a timely manner if our revenue falls short of our estimates. Accordingly, any significant shortfall of revenue in relation to our estimates could have an immediate negative effect on our financial results.\nWe may not maintain our current rate of revenue growth.\nOur revenue has increased quickly and substantially in recent periods. We believe that our continued revenue growth will depend on, among other factors, our ability to:\n\u2022\nimprove our market penetration through cost-efficient and effective sales and marketing programs to attract new members;\n\u2022\nconvert leads into enrollments;\n\u2022\nmaintain high retention rates;\n\u2022\nincrease the lifetime value per pet;\n\u2022\nmaintain positive relationships with veterinarians and other lead sources;\n\u2022\nmaintain positive relationships with and increase the number and efficiency of Territory Partners;\n\u2022\ncontinue to offer a superior value with competitive features and rates;\n\u2022\nprice our subscriptions in relation to actual operating expenses and achieve required regulatory approval for pricing changes;\n\u2022\nrecruit, integrate and retain skilled, qualified and experienced sales department professionals who can demonstrate our value proposition to new and existing members;\n\u2022\nprovide our members with superior member service, including timely and efficient payment of veterinary invoices, and by recruiting, integrating and retaining skilled and experienced personnel who can efficiently review veterinary invoices and process payments;\n\u2022\ngenerate new and maintain existing relationships and programs in our other business segment;\n\u2022\nreact to existing and new competitors;\n\u2022\nincrease awareness of and positive associations with our brand; and\n\u2022\nsuccessfully respond to and comply with regulations affecting our business and defend or prosecute any litigation.\nYou should not rely on our historical rate of revenue growth as an indication of our future performance.\nWe base our decisions regarding member acquisition expenditures primarily on the projected internal rate of return on marketing spend. Our estimates and assumptions may not accurately reflect our future results - we may overspend on member acquisition, and we may not be able to recover our member acquisition costs or generate profits from these investments.\nWe have made and plan to continue to make significant investments to grow our member base. We spent $33.3 million on sales and marketing to acquire new members for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our average pet acquisition cost and the number of new pets we enroll depends on a number of factors and assumptions, including the effectiveness of our sales execution and marketing initiatives, changes in costs of media, the mix of our sales and marketing expenditures and the competitive environment. Our average pet acquisition cost has increased over time and and has significantly varied in the past. In the future, our average pet acquisition cost may continue to rise and significantly vary period to period based upon specific marketing initiatives. We also regularly test new member acquisition channels and marketing initiatives, which often are more expensive than our traditional marketing channels and generally increase our average acquisition costs.\nIn addition, we base our decisions regarding our member acquisition expenditures primarily on our internal rate of return generated on an average pet. This analysis depends substantially on estimates and assumptions based on our historical experience with pets enrolled in earlier periods, including our key operating metrics. If our estimates and assumptions regarding our internal rate of return and the lifetime value of the pets that we project to acquire and our related decisions regarding investments in member acquisition prove incorrect, or if our calculation of internal rate of return and lifetime value of the pets that we project to acquire differs significantly from that of pets acquired in prior periods, we may be unable to recover our member acquisition costs or generate profits from our investment in acquiring new members. Moreover, if our member acquisition costs increase or we invest in member acquisition channels that do not ultimately result in any or an adequate number of new member enrollments, the return on our investment may be lower than we anticipate irrespective of the lifetime value of the pets that we project to acquire as a result of the new members. If we cannot generate profits from this investment, we may need to alter our growth strategy, and our growth rate and operating results may be adversely affected.\nWe depend in part on Internet search engines to attract potential new members to visit our website. If Internet search engines\u2019 methodologies are modified or our search result page rankings decline for other reasons, our new member growth could decline, and our business and operating results could be harmed.\nWe derive a significant amount of traffic to our website from consumers who search for pet medical insurance through Internet search engines, such as Google, Bing and Yahoo!. A critical factor in attracting consumers searching for pet medical insurance on the Internet to our website is whether we are prominently displayed in response to an Internet search relating to pet insurance. Algorithmic search result listings are determined and displayed in accordance with a set of formulas or algorithms developed by the particular Internet search engine, which may change from time to time. If we are listed less prominently in, or removed altogether from, search result listings for any reason, the traffic to our websites would decline and we may not be able to replace this traffic, which in turn would harm our business, operating results and financial condition. If we decide to attempt to replace this traffic, we may be required to increase our sales and marketing expenditures, including by utilizing paid search advertising. We are aware that certain of our competitors have spent additional funds to promote their products in search results over us. If we decide to respond by purchasing search advertising, our pet acquisition costs would increase and harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to grow our member base and maintain high member retention rates, our growth prospects and revenue will be adversely affected.\nOur ability to grow our business depends on retaining and expanding our member base. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated 83.7% of our revenue from subscriptions. In order to continue to increase our membership, we must continue to convince prospective members of the benefits of pet insurance and existing members of the continuing value of our product.\nWe utilize Territory Partners, who are paid fees based on enrollments in their regions, to communicate the benefits of medical insurance to veterinarians through in-person visits. Veterinarians then educate pet owners, who visit our website or call our contact center to learn more about these benefits, and potentially become members. We also invest in other third-party and direct to consumer member acquisition channels, though we have limited experience with some of them. We plan to expand the number of our Territory Partners and other lead-generation sources and to engage in other marketing activities, including direct to consumer advertising, which are likely to increase our acquisition costs.\nWe seek to convert consumers who visit our website and call our contact center into members. The rate at which we convert these visitors into members is a significant factor in the growth of our member base. A number of factors have influenced, and could in the future influence, the conversion rates for any given period, some of which are outside of our control. These factors include:\n\u2022\nthe competitiveness of our subscription, including its perceived value, simplicity, and fairness;\n\u2022\nchanges in consumer shopping behaviors due to circumstances outside of our control, such as economic conditions and consumers\u2019 ability or willingness to pay for our product;\n\u2022\nregulatory requirements, including those that make the experience on our website cumbersome or difficult to navigate or that hinder our ability to speak with potential members quickly and in a way that is conducive to conversion;\n\u2022\nsystem failures or interruptions in our website or contact center; and\n\u2022\nchanges in the mix of consumers who learn about us through various member acquisition channels.\nWe have made and plan to continue to make substantial investments in features and functionality for our website and training and staffing for our contact center that are designed to generate traffic, increase member engagement and improve member service. These activities do not directly generate revenue, however, and we may never realize any benefit from these investments. If the expenses that we incur in connection with these activities do not result in sufficient growth in members to offset the cost, our business, operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nWe have historically experienced high average monthly retention rates. For example, our average monthly retention rate between 2010 and 2019 was 98.5%. We expect to continue to make significant expenditures relating to the retention of existing members, including an increase in the number of inside account managers and development and implementation of new technology platforms designed to encourage retention of these members.\nIf we do not retain our existing members or if our marketing initiatives do not result in enrolling more pets or result in enrolling pets that inherently have a lower retention rate, we may not be able to maintain our retention and new member acquisition rates. Members we obtain through aggressive promotions or other channels that involve relatively less meaningful contact between us and the member are more likely to terminate their subscription. In the past, we have experienced reduced retention rates during periods of rapid member growth, as our retention rate generally has been lower during the first year of member enrollment. Members may choose to terminate their subscription for a variety of reasons, including perceived or actual lack of value, delays or other unsatisfactory experiences in how we review and process veterinary invoice payments, unsatisfactory member service, an economic downturn, increased subscription fees, loss of a pet, a more attractive offer from a competitor, changes in our subscription or other reasons, including reasons that are outside of our control. Our cost of acquiring a new member is substantially greater than the cost involved in maintaining our relationship with an existing member. If we are not able to successfully retain existing members and limit terminations, our revenue and operating margins will be adversely impacted and our business, operating results and financial condition would be harmed.\nWe rely significantly on Territory Partners, veterinarians and other third parties, including strategic partners, to generate leads.\nIn order for us to implement our business strategy and grow our revenue, we must effectively maintain and increase the number and quality of our relationships with Territory Partners, veterinarians, existing members, online and other businesses, animal shelters, breeders and veterinary affiliates, including veterinarian purchasing groups and associations and other referral sources, and continue to scale and improve our processes, programs and procedures that support them. Those processes, programs and procedures could become increasingly complex and difficult to manage as we grow.\nVeterinary leads represent our largest member acquisition channel. We spend significant time and resources attracting qualified Territory Partners and providing them with current information about our business and they, in turn, communicate the benefits of medical insurance for pets to veterinarians. Our relationship with our Territory Partners may be terminated at any time (for instance, if they feel unsupported or undervalued by us), and, if terminated, we may not recoup the costs associated with educating them about our subscription or be able to maintain any relationships they may have developed with veterinarians within their territories. Sometimes a single relationship may be used to cover multiple territories so that a terminated relationship could significantly affect our company. Further, if we experience an increase in the rate at which Territory Partner relationships are terminated, we may not develop or maintain relationships with veterinarians as quickly as we have in the past or need to in order to implement our business strategy and our growth and financial performance could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to generate leads through veterinary hospitals could be negatively impacted if our policy is perceived to be inadequate, unreliable, cumbersome or otherwise does not provide sufficient value, or if our process for paying veterinary invoices is unsatisfactory to the veterinarians\u2019 clients.\nIf we fail to establish or are unable to maintain our existing member acquisition channels and/or continue to add new member acquisition channels, if the cost of our existing sources increases or does not scale as we anticipate, or if we are unable to continue to use any existing channels or programs in any jurisdiction, including our exam day offer program, our member levels and sales and marketing expenses may be adversely affected.\nTerritory Partners are independent contractors and, as such, may pose additional risks to our business.\nTerritory Partners are independent contractors and, accordingly, we do not directly provide the same direction, motivation and oversight over Territory Partners as we otherwise could if Territory Partners were our own employees. Further, Territory Partners may themselves employ or engage others; we refer to these partners and their associates, collectively, as our Territory Partners. We do not control a Territory Partner\u2019s employment or engagement of others, and it is possible that the actions of their employees and/or contractors could create threatened or actual legal proceedings against us.\nTerritory Partners may decide not to participate in our marketing initiatives and/or training opportunities, accept our introduction of new solutions or comply with our policies and procedures applicable to them, any of which may adversely affect our ability to develop relationships with veterinarians and grow our membership. Our sole recourse against Territory Partners who fail to perform is to terminate their contract, which could also trigger contractually obligated termination payments or result in disputes, including threatened or actual legal or regulatory proceedings.\nWe believe that Territory Partners are not and should not be classified as employees under existing interpretations of the applicable laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We do not pay or withhold any employment tax with respect to or on behalf of Territory Partners or extend any benefits to them that we generally extend to our employees, and we otherwise treat Territory Partners as independent contractors. Applicable authorities or the Territory Partners have in the past questioned and may in the future challenge this classification. Further, the applicable laws or regulations, including tax laws or interpretations, may change. If it were determined that we had misclassified any of our Territory Partners, we may be subjected to penalties and/or be required to pay withholding taxes, extend employee benefits, provide compensation for unpaid overtime, or otherwise incur substantially greater expenses with respect to Territory Partners. In addition, the costs associated with defending, settling, or resolving pending and future lawsuits (including demands for arbitration) relating to the independent contractor status of Territory Partners could be material to our business.\nAny of the foregoing circumstances could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.\nThe prices of our subscriptions are based on assumptions and estimates. If our actual experience differs from the assumptions and estimates used in pricing our subscriptions or if we are unable to obtain any necessary regulatory approval for our pricing, our revenue and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nThe pricing of our subscriptions reflects amounts we expect to pay for a pet\u2019s medical care and we derive these prices from assumptions that we make based on our analytics platform. Our analytics platform draws upon pet data we collect and we use this data to price our policy in response to a number of factors, including a pet\u2019s species, breed, age, gender and location. Factors related to pet location include the current and assumed changes in the cost and availability of veterinary technology and treatments and local veterinary hospital preferences. The assumptions we make about breeds and other factors in pricing may prove to be inaccurate and, accordingly, these pricing analytics may not accurately reflect the expense that we will ultimately incur. Furthermore, if any of our competitors develop similar or better data systems, adopt similar or better underwriting criteria and pricing models or receive our data, our competitive advantage could decline or be lost.\nThe prices of our subscriptions also reflect assumptions and estimates regarding our own operating costs and expenses. We monitor and manage our pricing and overall sales mix to achieve our target returns. If the actual costs, including veterinary invoice expenses, operating costs and expenses within anticipated pricing allowances, are greater than our assumptions and estimates such that the premiums we collect are insufficient to cover these expenses, then our gross profit could be adversely affected and our revenue may be insufficient to maintain profitability. Conversely, if our pricing assumptions differ from actual results such that we overprice risks, our competitiveness and growth prospects could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, many states have adopted laws or are considering proposed legislation that, among other things, limit the ability of insurance companies to effect rate increases or to cancel, reduce or not renew existing policies, and many state regulators have the power to reduce, or to disallow increases in premium rates. Most states require licensure and regulatory approval prior to marketing new insurance products. Our practice has been to regularly reevaluate the price of our subscriptions, with any pricing changes implemented at least annually, subject to the review and approval of the state regulators, who may reduce or disallow our pricing changes. Such review has often in the past resulted, and may in the future result, in delayed implementation of pricing changes and prevent us from making changes we believe are necessary to achieve our targeted payout ratio, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. In addition, we may be prevented by regulators from limiting significant pricing changes, requiring us to raise rates more quickly than we otherwise may desire. This could damage our reputation with our members and reduce our retention rates, which could significantly damage our brand, result in the loss of expected revenue and otherwise harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur actual veterinary invoice expense may exceed our current reserve established for veterinary invoices and may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nOur recorded reserve for veterinary invoices is based on our best estimates of the amount of veterinary invoices we expect to pay, inclusive of an estimate for veterinary invoices we have not yet received, after considering internal factors, including data from our proprietary data analytics platform, experience with similar cases, actual veterinary invoices paid, historical trends involving veterinary invoice payment patterns, patterns of receipt of veterinary invoices, seasonality, pending levels of unpaid veterinary invoices, veterinary invoice processing programs and contractual terms. We may also consider external factors, including changes in the law, court decisions, changes to regulatory requirements and economic conditions. Because reserves are estimates of veterinary invoices that have been incurred but are not yet submitted to us, setting appropriate reserves is an inherently uncertain and complex process that involves significant subjective judgment. Further, we do not transfer or cede our risk as an insurer and, therefore, we maintain more risk than we would if we purchased reinsurance.\nRising costs of veterinary care and the increasing availability and usage of more expensive, technologically advanced medical treatments may increase the amounts of veterinary invoices we receive. Increases in the number of veterinary invoices we receive could arise from unexpected events that are inherently difficult to predict, such as a pandemic that spreads through the pet population, tainted pet food or supplies or an unusually high number of serious injuries or illnesses. We may experience volatility in the number of veterinary invoices we receive from time to time, and short-term trends may not continue over the longer term. The number of veterinary invoices may be affected by the level of care and attentiveness an owner provides to the pet, the pet\u2019s breed and age (at enrollment) and other factors outside of our control, as well as fluctuations in member retention rates and by new member initiatives that encourage an increase in veterinary invoices and other new member acquisition activities.\nThe ultimate cost of paying veterinary invoices and the related administration may vary materially from recorded reserves, and such variance may result in adjustments to the reserve for veterinary invoices, which could have a material effect on our operating results and resources available for acquiring additional members.\nAs more veterinary hospitals install and use our patented proprietary software, the number or amounts of veterinary invoices we receive is likely to increase.\nOur patented proprietary software is designed to integrate directly with most software systems used by veterinary hospitals and allow us to receive and pay veterinarian invoices directly. We believe that it is critical to our long-term success to improve the member experience so we encourage veterinary hospitals to install and use our software. We have found that installation and use of our software by a veterinary hospital could increase the number of invoices we receive from that practice. As more veterinary hospitals install our software, we expect the number or amounts of veterinary invoices to increase and result in an increase in our cost of revenue and this may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nOur use of capital may be constrained by risk-based capital regulations or contractual obligations.\nOur subsidiary, APIC, is subject to risk-based capital regulations that require us to maintain certain levels of surplus to support our overall business operations in consideration of our size and risk profile. We have in the past and may in the future fail to maintain the amount of risk-based capital required to avoid additional regulatory oversight, which was $55.3 million as of December 31, 2019. We are also subject to a contractual obligation related to our reinsurance agreement with Omega, who writes our policies in Canada. Under this agreement, we are required to fund a Canadian trust account in accordance with Canadian regulations. As of December 31, 2019, the account held CAD $4.3 million.\nTo comply with these regulations and contractual obligations, we may be required to maintain capital that we would otherwise invest in our growth and operations, which may require us to modify our operating plan or marketing initiatives, delay the implementation of new solutions or development of new technologies, decrease the rate at which we hire additional personnel and enter into relationships with Territory Partners, incur indebtedness or pursue equity or debt financings or otherwise modify our business operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nOur success depends on our ability to review, process, and pay veterinary invoices timely and accurately.\nWe believe member satisfaction depends on our ability to accurately evaluate and pay veterinary invoices in a timely manner. Many factors can affect our ability to do this, including the training, experience and skill of our personnel, our ability to reduce the number of payment requests made for services not included in our subscription, effectiveness of management, our ability to develop or select and implement appropriate procedures, supporting technologies and systems, changes in our policy and veterinarian compliance with our protocols and procedures. Our failure to pay veterinary invoices, accurately and in a timely manner, or to deploy resources appropriately, could result in unanticipated costs to us, lead to material litigation, undermine member goodwill and our reputation, and impair our brand image and, as a result, materially and adversely affect our competitiveness, financial results, prospects and liquidity.\nWe may not identify fraudulent or improperly inflated veterinary invoices.\nIt is possible that a member, or a third-party could submit a veterinary invoice which we would then pay that appears authentic but in fact does not reflect services provided or products purchased for which the member paid. It is also possible that veterinarians will charge insured customers higher amounts than they would charge their non-insured clients for the same service or product. Such activity could lead to unanticipated costs to us and/or to time and expense to recover such costs. They could also lead to strained relationships with veterinarians and/or members, and could adversely affect our competitiveness, financial results and liquidity.\nWe are and will continue to be faced with many competitive challenges, any of which could adversely affect our prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nWe compete with pet owners that self-finance unexpected veterinary invoices with savings or credit, as well as traditional \u201cpet insurance\u201d providers and relatively new entrants into our market. The vast majority of pet owners in the United States and Canada do not currently have medical insurance for their pets. We are focused primarily on expanding our share of the overall market, and we view our primary competitive challenge as educating pet owners on why our subscription is a better alternative to self-financing.\nAdditionally, there are traditional insurance companies that provide pet insurance products, either as a stand-alone product or along with a broad range of other insurance products, such as wellness. In addition, new entrants backed by large insurance companies, such as Marsh, Nationwide, and Geico, have attempted to enter the pet insurance market in the past and may do so again in the future. Further, traditional \u201cpet insurance\u201d providers may consolidate or take other actions to mimic the efficiencies from our vertically-integrated structure or create other operational efficiencies, which could lead to increased competition.\nSome of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do. Some of our competitors may be able to undertake more extensive marketing initiatives for their brands and services, devote more resources to website and systems development and make offers that are more attractive to potential employees, referral sources and third-party service providers.\nTo compete effectively, we believe we will need to continue to invest significant resources in sales and marketing, in improving our member service levels, in the online experience and functionalities of our website and in other technologies and infrastructure. Failure to compete effectively against our current or future competitors could result in loss of current or potential members, which could adversely affect our pricing, lower our revenue, prevent us from maintaining profitability and diminish our brand strength.\nIf we are unable to maintain and enhance our brand recognition and reputation, our business and operating results will be harmed.\nWe believe that maintaining and enhancing our brand recognition and reputation is critical to our relationships with existing members, Territory Partners, veterinarians and others, and to our ability to attract new members, new Territory Partners, and additional supportive veterinarians. We also believe that the importance of our brand recognition and reputation will continue to increase as competition in our market continues to develop and mature. Our success in this area will depend on a wide range of factors, some of which are out of our control, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe efficacy and viability of our sales and marketing programs;\n\u2022\nthe perceived value of our subscription;\n\u2022\nthe quality of service provided, including the fairness, ease and timeliness of reviewing and paying veterinary invoices;\n\u2022\nactions of our competitors, Territory Partners, veterinarians and others;\n\u2022\npositive or negative publicity, including regulatory pronouncements and material on the Internet or social media;\n\u2022\nregulatory and other government-related developments; and\n\u2022\nlitigation-related developments.\nThe promotion of our brand will require us to make substantial investments, and we anticipate that, as our market becomes increasingly competitive, these branding initiatives may become increasingly difficult and expensive. For instance, we have found that search engine optimization costs have increased as competitors have spent additional funds to promote their products in search results over us. Our brand promotion activities may not be successful or yield increased revenue, and to the extent that these activities result in increased revenue, the increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incur and our operating results could be harmed. If we do not successfully maintain and enhance our brand, our business may not grow and could be adversely affected, which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nFurthermore, negative publicity, whether or not justified, relating to events or activities attributed to us, our employees, our strategic partners, our affiliates, or others associated with any of these parties, may tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brands. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity may reduce demand for our services and have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Moreover, any attempts to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brands may be costly and time consuming, and such efforts may not ultimately be successful.\nOur business depends on our ability to maintain and scale the infrastructure necessary to operate our technology platform and could be adversely affected by a system failure.\nOur business depends on our ability to maintain and scale the infrastructure necessary to operate our technology platform, which includes our analytics and pricing engine, systems for managing veterinary invoice payments, customer relationship management system, billing system, contact center phone system and website. We use these technology frameworks to price our subscriptions, enroll members, engage with current members and pay veterinary invoices. Our members review and purchase subscriptions through our website and contact center, and for those veterinary hospitals who have installed our patented proprietary software, we receive and pay veterinarian invoices directly through our software. Our reputation and ability to acquire, retain and serve our members depends on the reliable performance of our technology platform and the underlying network systems and infrastructure, and on providing best-in-class member service, including through our contact center and website. As our member base continues to grow, the amount of information collected and stored on the systems and infrastructure supporting our technology platform will continue to grow, and we expect to require an increasing amount of network capacity, computing power and information technology personnel to develop and maintain our technology platform and service our departments involved in member interaction.\nWe have made, and expect to continue to make, substantial investments in equipment and related network infrastructure to handle the operational demands on our technology platform, including increasing data collection, software development, traffic on our website and the volume of calls at our contact center. The operation of the systems and infrastructure supporting our technology platform is expensive and complex and could experience operational failures. In the event that our data collection, member base or amount of traffic on these systems grows more quickly than anticipated, we may be required to incur significant additional costs to increase the capacity in our systems. Further, our development and implementation activities may not be successful, may not be well-received by veterinarians or by new or existing members, particularly if they are costly, cumbersome or unreliable, and we may incur delays or cost overruns or elect to curtail our currently planned expenditures related to them. Even if our system improvements are well-received, they may be or become obsolete due to technological reasons or the availability of alternative solutions in the marketplace. If new solutions and enhancements are not successful on a long-term basis, we may not realize benefits from these investments, and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, any system failure that causes an interruption in or decreases the responsiveness of our services could impair our revenue-generating capabilities, harm our business and operating results and damage our reputation. In addition, any loss or mishandling of data could result in breach of confidence, competitive disadvantage or loss of members, and subject us to potential liability. Any failure of the systems and infrastructure that we rely on could negatively impact our enrollments as well as our relationship with members. If we do not maintain or expand the systems and infrastructure underlying our technology platform successfully, or if we experience operational failures, our reputation could be harmed and we could lose current and potential members, which could harm our operating results and financial condition.\nIf we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business, operating results and financial condition may suffer.\nWe have recently experienced, and expect to continue to experience, significant growth, which has placed, and may continue to place, significant demands on our management and our operational and financial systems and infrastructure. We expect that our growth strategy will require us to commit substantial financial, operational and technical resources and this commitment may also result in increased costs (such as member acquisition costs or costs associated with increases in the number or amounts of veterinary invoices received) generated by our business, which could prevent us from remaining profitable and could impair our ability to compete effectively for business. If we do not effectively manage growth at any time, our financial condition could be harmed and the quality of our services could suffer.\nIn order to successfully expand our business, we need to hire, integrate and retain highly skilled and motivated employees and continue to improve our existing systems for operational and financial management. These improvements could require significant capital expenditures and place increasing demands on our management. If we do not successfully implement improvements in these areas, our business, operating results and financial condition will be harmed.\nEmerging claim and coverage issues may adversely affect our business.\nAs industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge, including new or expanded theories of liability. These or other changes could impose new financial obligations on us by extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or otherwise require us to make unplanned modifications to the products and services that we provide, or cause the delay or cancellation of products and services that we provide. In some instances, these changes may not become apparent until sometime after we have issued subscriptions that are affected by the changes. As a result, the full extent of liability under our subscriptions may not be known for many years after subscription begins.\nOur operating results may vary, which could make period-to-period comparisons less meaningful, and make our future results difficult to predict.\nWe may experience fluctuations in our revenue, expenses and operating results in future periods. Our operating results may fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These fluctuations may make comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis less meaningful and make our future results difficult to predict. You should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. In addition, if revenue levels do not meet our expectations, our operating results and ability to execute on our business plan are likely to be harmed.\nSeasonal or periodic variations in the behavior of our members also may cause fluctuations in our financial results. Enrollment in our subscription tends to be discretionary in nature and may be sporadic, reflecting overall economic conditions, budgeting constraints, pet-buying patterns and a variety of other factors, many of which are outside our control. For example, we have experienced some effects of seasonal trends in visits to veterinarians in the fourth quarter and in the beginning of the first quarter of each year in connection with the traditional holiday season. While we believe seasonal trends have affected and will continue to affect our quarterly results, our growth may have overshadowed these effects to date. We believe that our business will continue to be subject to seasonality in the future, which may result in fluctuations in our financial results\nDue to these and other factors, our financial results for any quarterly or annual period may not meet our expectations or the expectations of investors or analysts that follow our stock and may not be meaningful indications of our future performance.\nMergers or other strategic transactions involving our competitors could weaken our competitive position, which could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and harm our results of operations.\nOur industry is highly fragmented, and we believe it is likely that some of our existing competitors will consolidate or be acquired. In addition, some of our competitors may enter into new alliances with each other or may establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with systems integrators, third-party consulting firms or other parties. Any such consolidation, acquisition, alliance or cooperative relationship could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and lead to pricing pressure and our loss of market share and could result in a competitor with greater financial, technical, marketing, service and other resources, all of which could harm our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nWe depend on key personnel to operate our business and, if we are unable to retain, attract and integrate qualified personnel, our ability to develop and successfully grow our business could be harmed.\nOur success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of our current management team, including Darryl Rawlings, our founder and Chief Executive Officer. The loss of Mr. Rawlings or several other key executives or employees within a short time frame could have a material adverse effect on our business. We employ all of our executive officers and key employees on an at-will basis, and their employment can be terminated by us or them at any time, for any reason and without notice, subject, in certain cases, to severance payment rights. In order to retain valuable employees, in addition to salary and cash incentives, we have provided stock options and restricted stock that vest over time and may in the future grant equity awards tied to company performance. The value to employees of stock options and restricted stock that vest over time will be significantly affected by movements in our stock price that are beyond our control and may at any time be insufficient to maintain their retention benefit or counteract offers from other companies. We would be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of our senior management and other key employees. Additionally, if we were to lose a large percentage of our current employees in a relatively short time period, or our employees were to engage in a work stoppage or unionize, we may be unable to hire and train new employees quickly enough to prevent disruptions in our operations, which may result in the loss of members, Territory Partners or referral sources.\nOur success also depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate additional skilled management personnel. We plan to continue to expand our work force, which we believe will enhance our business and operating results. We believe that there is significant competition for qualified personnel with the skills and knowledge that we require. Many of the other companies with which we compete for qualified personnel have greater financial and other resources than we do. New hires require significant training and, in most cases, take significant time before they achieve full productivity. New employees may not become as productive as we expect, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals.\nWe have and may continue to create, invest in or acquire businesses, products and technologies, which could divert our management\u2019s attention, result in additional dilution to our stockholders, otherwise disrupt our operations or harm our operating results.\nWe have and may continue to create, invest in or acquire complementary businesses, products, technologies and new lines of business. Our ability to successfully evaluate and manage investment opportunities, or make and integrate acquisitions or products, is unproven. For example, we have invested in a pet food initiative, and we believe that pet food may be an important part of our offerings over the long term. We do not have experience manufacturing, selling, or distributing food products and pet food manufacturing facilities and pet food products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the United States Department of Agriculture, the Federal Food and Drug Administration, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and other federal, state, local, and foreign governmental agencies relating to the production, packaging, labelling, storage, distribution, quality, and safety of food products and the health and safety of employees.\nThe pursuit of potential new products, investments or acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying, investigating and pursuing suitable opportunities, whether or not they are consummated. Further, even if we successfully invest in or acquire additional businesses or technologies, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the transaction. The investment or acquisition may also expose us to additional risks, including from unknowingly inheriting liabilities that are not adequately covered by indemnities. Acquisitions or investments could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nIf we do not spend our development budget efficiently or effectively on commercially successful and innovative offerings and products, we may not realize the expected benefits of our strategy. Further, our development efforts with respect to new products and offerings could distract management from current operations, and will divert capital and other resources from our more established products and offerings. If an investment or acquisition fails to meet our expectations, our business, operating results and financial condition may suffer.\nWe depend on relationships with strategic partners, and our inability to maintain our existing and secure new relationships with strategic partners could harm our revenue and operating results.\nA portion of our revenue is attributable to a variety of different types of strategic partnership arrangements. These partnerships involve various risks, depending on their structure, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to maintain or secure favorable relationships with strategic partners;\n\u2022\nour strategic partners may not be successful in creating leads;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to convert leads from our strategic partners into enrolled pets;\n\u2022\nour strategic partners could terminate their relationships with us;\n\u2022\nour strategic partners may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business with us;\n\u2022\nwe may not experience a consistent correlation between revenues and expenditures related to the partnership; and\n\u2022\nbad publicity and other issues faced by our strategic partners could negatively impact us.\nAny inability to secure, maintain or effectively manage these complicated relationships with strategic partners could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and operating results.\nOur business and financial condition is subject to risks related to our writing of policies unaffiliated third parties.\nOur other business segment includes revenues and expenses involving contractual relationships with unaffiliated third parties and related marketing to enterprises. We have relatively limited experience in writing policies for unaffiliated third parties. This business is not expected to grow at the same rate as our core business and may decline. Changes to this business may be volatile due to the nature of the relationships. Further, this business historically has had, and we expect it to continue to have, lower margins than our core business. As a result of this line of business, we are subject to additional regulatory requirements and scrutiny, which increase our costs and risks, and may have an adverse effect on our operations. Further, administration of this business and any similar business in the future may divert our time and attention away from our core business, which could adversely affect our operating results in the aggregate.\nFor example, the pet insurance policies we write for general agents are subject to materially different terms and conditions than our subscription. They are typically annual policies with monthly payment terms, which can result in accounts receivable balances and payment timing patterns we do not experience in our subscription business. The relationships with these general agents may be terminated by either party and, if terminated, would result in a reduction in our revenue to the extent we cannot enter other relationships and generate equivalent revenue with different general agents. For the year ended December 31, 2019, premiums from policies sourced by general agents accounted for 14% of our total revenue, and one general agent sourced members whose premiums accounted for over 10% of our total revenue. Further, the unaffiliated general agents administer these policies and market them to consumers. If the general agents make operating decisions that adversely affect its business or brand, our business or brand could also be adversely affected.\nIn Canada, our medical plan is written by Omega General Insurance Company. If Omega were to terminate its underwriting arrangement with us, our business could be adversely affected.\nIn Canada, our pet insurance subscription is written by Omega, and we assume all premiums written by Omega and the related veterinary invoice expense through an agency agreement and a fronting and administration agreement. If Omega were to terminate our agreement or be unable to write insurance for regulatory or other reasons, we may have to terminate subscriptions with our existing Canadian members, or suspend member enrollment and renewals in Canada until we enter into a relationship with another third party to write our subscription or we set up an entity able to perform this service, which may take a significant amount of time and require significant expense. We may not be able to enter into a new relationship, and any new relationship would likely be on less favorable terms. Any delay in entry into a new relationship or suspension of member enrollment and renewals could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nChanges in the foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our revenue and operating results.\nWe offer our subscription in Canada and in the future may offer it in other countries, which exposes us to the risk of changes in currency exchange rates. For the year ended December 31, 2019, approximately 18% of our total revenue was generated in Canada. Fluctuations in the relative strength of the US dollar has in the past and could in the future adversely affect our revenue and operating results.\nWe may decide to set up multiple insurance subsidiaries, which may complicate our business and harm our results of operations.\nCurrently, APIC, our wholly owned subsidiary, underwrites memberships for our U.S. subscription product, and Omega, a third party, underwrites memberships for our Canadian subscription product. We are in the process of setting up additional wholly owned insurance companies in the U.S. and Canada to underwrite our subscription and in the future we may decide to set up and operate additional wholly-owned insurance companies in the U.S., Canada or a different country. The pursuit of acquiring or forming a new insurance subsidiary may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying, investigating and pursuing suitable opportunities, whether or not the formation or acquisition is completed. Further, even if we are successful in forming or acquiring a new insurance subsidiary we may not achieve the anticipated benefits. In addition, we may require additional capital to meet our risk-based capital requirements for the new insurance subsidiaries and will be subject to additional regulatory scrutiny in the jurisdiction of incorporation and any additional jurisdictions the insurance subsidiary operates. Failure to comply with laws, regulations and guidelines applicable to a new insurance subsidiary could result in significant liability, result in the loss of revenue and otherwise harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock may be negatively affected.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and provide a management report on the internal control over financial reporting, which must be attested to by our independent registered public accounting firm.\nWe may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated. We have had in the past, and may have in the future, material weaknesses and significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting. If we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify future material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective or our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected. We could also become subject to investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nIf our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to our data, including our members\u2019 data, we may lose our competitive advantage, our systems may be perceived as not being secure and we may incur third-party liability.\nOur data repository contains proprietary information that we believe gives us a competitive advantage, including data on veterinary invoices received and other data with respect to members, Territory Partners, veterinarians and other third parties. We also collect and utilize demographic and other information from and about our members when they visit our website, call our contact center and apply for enrollment. Further, we use tracking technologies, including \u201ccookies,\u201d to help us manage and track our members\u2019 interactions and deliver relevant advice and advertising. Security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of our data and/or disclosure of this data, either publicly or to a third party who could use the information to gain a competitive advantage. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. In the event of a loss of our systems or data, we could experience increased costs, delays, legal liability and reputational harm, which in turn may harm our financial condition, damage our brand and result in the loss of members. Such a disclosure also could lead to litigation and possible liability.\nIn the course of operating our business, we store and/or transmit our members\u2019 confidential information, including credit card and bank account numbers and other private information. Because the methods used to obtain unauthorized access to private information change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, security breaches would expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation and possible liability. Our payment services are similarly susceptible to credit card and other payment fraud schemes, including unauthorized use of credit cards, debit cards or bank account information, identity theft or merchant fraud.\nIf our security measures are breached as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, and, as a result, someone obtains unauthorized access to our data, including data of our members, our reputation may be damaged, our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the public perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed.\nIn addition, cyber-attacks or acts of terrorism could cause disruptions in our business or the economy as a whole. Our servers and systems may also be vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems, which could lead to interruptions, delays, loss of critical data or the unauthorized disclosure of confidential member data. We currently have limited disaster recovery capability, and our business interruption insurance may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur. Such disruptions could negatively impact our ability to run our business, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nWe are subject to a number of risks related to accepting automatic fund transfers and credit card and debit card payments.\nWe accept payments of subscription fees from our members through automatic fund transfers and credit and debit card transactions. For credit and debit card payments, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time. An increase in the number of members who utilize credit and debit cards to pay their subscription fees or related credit and debit card fees would reduce our margins and could require us to increase subscription fees, which could cause us to lose members and revenue, or suffer an increase in our operating expenses, either of which could adversely affect our operating results.\nIf we, or any of our processing vendors or banks have problems with our billing software, or if the billing software malfunctions, it could have an adverse effect on our member satisfaction and could cause one or more of the major credit card companies or banks to disallow our continued use of their payment products. In addition, if our billing software fails to work properly and, as a result, we do not automatically charge our members\u2019 credit cards on a timely basis or at all, or a bank withdraws the incorrect amount or fails to timely transfer the correct amount to us, we could lose revenue and harm our member experience, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Moreover, a vendor could fail to process payments, or could process payments in the wrong amounts, which could result in us failing to collect premiums, could result in increased cancellations and could adversely affect our reputation.\nWe are also subject to payment card association operating rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), a security standard applicable to companies that collect, store or transmit certain data regarding credit and debit cards, holders and transactions. Although we are currently compliant with PCI DSS, in the past we were not, and in the future we may not be, fully or materially compliant with PCI DSS, or other payment card operating rules. Any failure to comply with the PCI DSS in the future may violate payment card association operating rules, federal and state laws and regulations, and the terms of our contracts with payment processors and merchant banks. Such failure to comply may subject us to fines, penalties, damages and civil liability, and may result in the loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments. In addition, there is no guarantee that PCI DSS compliance will prevent illegal or improper use of our payment systems or the theft, loss or misuse of data pertaining to credit and debit cards, credit and debit card holders and credit and debit card transactions.\nIf we fail to adequately control fraudulent credit card transactions, we may face civil liability, diminished public perception of our security measures and significantly higher credit card-related costs, each of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to maintain our chargeback rate at acceptable levels, our credit card fees for chargeback transactions, or our fees for many or all categories of credit and debit card transactions, credit card companies and debit card issuers may increase our fees or terminate their relationship with us. Any increases in our credit card and debit card fees could adversely affect our operating results, particularly if we elect not to raise our subscription fees. The termination of our ability to process payments on any major credit or debit card would significantly impair our ability to operate our business.\nWe have limited experience owning an office building and may face unexpected costs.\nIn August 2018, we purchased our home office building. Prior to this purchase, we had no experience owning an office building. It is difficult to predict all costs associated with maintaining the building and ensuring it is suitable for our use and that of other tenants and maintain compliance with all environmental and other regulations applicable to ownership of real estate. It is possible that the other current tenants in the building may cease to rent space in the building, which would decrease rental income we expect to receive from them. We recently learned that one tenant has decided not to continue leasing space in the building and we are evaluating use of the newly vacant space. Tenants may also negotiate tenant improvements, requiring capital expenditures that may adversely impact our financial position. In addition, we may identify structural defects or other conditions, or we may determine that remodeling or renovations are necessary given our business operations and objectives. Managing tenants, maintaining the building, and otherwise facing the costs and responsibilities of being the owner of a building may be a distraction from our core business and cause our performance to suffer.\nFailure to adequately protect our intellectual property could substantially harm our business and operating results.\nWe rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, patents, copyrights, trademarks and domain names, as well as contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our patented proprietary software and our intellectual property. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy our digital content, pricing analytics, technology, software, branding and functionality, or obtain and use information that we consider proprietary. Moreover, policing our proprietary rights is difficult and may not always be effective. If we continue to expand internationally, we may need to enforce our rights under the laws of countries that do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States, which may be expensive and divert management\u2019s attention away from other operations.\nOur proprietary software is protected by patents. These patents may not be sufficient to maintain effective product exclusivity because patent rights are limited in time and do not always provide effective protection. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce or protect our patent rights may be ineffective, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, could result in the invalidation of our patent rights, and could substantially harm our operating results. Even where our patents rights are enforced, legal remedies available for harm caused to us by infringing products may be inadequate to make us whole. Further, our successful assertion of our patent against one competing product is not necessarily predictive of our future success or failure in asserting the same patent against a second competing product. In addition, patents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years after it is filed. Various extensions may be available. However, the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Once the patent life has expired for our software, our competitors will be able to use our patented technology.\nWe seek to control access to our proprietary technology, software and documentation by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and partners, confidentiality agreements or license agreements with third parties, such as service providers, vendors, individuals and entities that may be exploring a business relationship with us, and terms of use with third parties, such as veterinary hospitals desiring to use our technology, software and documentation. These agreements may not prevent disclosure of intellectual property, trade secrets and/or other confidential information, and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of misappropriation of trade secrets or any unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets and other confidential information. In addition, others may independently discover trade secrets and confidential information and, in such cases, we may not be able to assert any trade secret rights against such parties. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our intellectual property rights and related confidentiality, license and nondisclosure provisions, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection, or our competitors being able to obtain our trade secrets or to independently develop technology similar to ours or competing technologies, could adversely affect our competitive business position.\nLitigation or proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or other governmental authorities and administrative bodies in the United States and abroad may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our domain names and to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Our efforts to enforce or protect our proprietary rights may be ineffective, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could substantially harm our operating results.\nAssertions by third parties of infringement or other violation by us of their intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business and operating results.\nThird parties have in the past and may in the future claim that our services or technologies infringe or otherwise violate their intellectual property rights. We may be subject to legal proceedings and claims, including claims of alleged infringement by us of the intellectual property rights of third parties. Any dispute or litigation regarding intellectual property could be expensive and time consuming, regardless of the merits of any claim, and could divert our management and key personnel from our operations.\nIf we were to discover or be notified that our services potentially infringe or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others, we may need to obtain licenses from these parties in order to avoid infringement. We may not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms, or at all, and any such license may substantially restrict our use of the intellectual property. Moreover, if we are sued for infringement and lose the lawsuit, we could be required to pay substantial damages or be enjoined from offering the infringing services. Any of the foregoing could cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from selling or properly administering subscriptions or performing under our other contractual relationships.\nWe rely on third parties to provide intellectual property and technology necessary for the operation of our business.\nWe utilize intellectual property and technology owned and/or hosted by third parties in developing and operating our technology platform and operating our business. From time to time, we may be required to renegotiate with these third parties or negotiate with other third parties to include or continue using their intellectual property or technology in our existing technology platform or business operations or in modifications or enhancements to our technology platform or business operations. We may not be able to obtain the necessary rights from these third parties on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and the third-party intellectual property and technology we use or desire to use may not be appropriately supported, maintained or enhanced by the third parties. If we are unable to obtain the rights necessary to use or continue to use third-party intellectual property and technology in our operations, or if those third parties are unable to support, maintain and enhance their intellectual property and technology, we could experience increased costs or delays, which in turn may harm our financial condition, damage our brand and result in the loss of members.\nOur technology platform and our data are also hosted by a third-party service provider. The terms under which such third-party service provider provides us services may change and we may be required to renegotiate with that third party. If we are unable to renegotiate satisfactory terms, we may not be able to transition to an alternative service provider without interrupting the availability of our technology platform and any interruption could materially and adversely affect our business. Additionally, if our third-party service provider experiences any disruptions, outages or catastrophes, or if it ceases to conduct business for any reason, we could experience an interruption in our business, which in turn may damage our brand, result in a loss of members and harm our financial condition.\nThe outcome of litigation or regulatory proceedings could subject us to significant monetary damages, restrict our ability to conduct our business, harm our reputation and otherwise negatively impact our business.\nFrom time to time, we have been, and in the future may become, subject to litigation, claims and regulatory proceedings and inquiries, including market conduct examinations and investigations by state insurance regulatory agencies and threatened or filed lawsuits by, among others, government agencies, employees, competitors, current or former members, or business partners.\nWe cannot predict the outcome of these actions or proceedings, and the cost of defending such actions or proceedings could be material. Further, defending such actions or proceedings could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. If we are found liable in any action or proceeding, we may have to pay substantial damages or fines, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects. More critically, an adverse result from a proceeding could require us to change the way we conduct our business, including our marketing and promotional practices, and such a result may have a greater adverse effect on our business than monetary damages or fines. There may also be negative publicity associated with litigation or regulatory proceedings that could harm our reputation or decrease acceptance of our services. These claims may be costly to defend and may result in assessment of damages, adverse tax consequences and harm to our reputation.\nCovenants in the credit agreement governing our revolving line of credit may restrict our operations, and if we do not effectively manage our business to comply with these covenants, our financial condition could be adversely affected.\nThe credit agreement governing our revolving line of credit contains various restrictive covenants, including restrictions on our ability to dispose of our assets, merge with or acquire other entities, incur other indebtedness, make investments, and engage in transactions with our affiliates. Our credit agreement also contains certain financial covenants. Our ability to meet these restrictive covenants can be affected by events beyond our control. Our credit agreement provides that our breach or failure to satisfy certain covenants constitutes an event of default. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, our lenders could elect to declare any future amounts outstanding under our credit agreement to be immediately due and payable. If we are unable to repay those amounts, our financial condition could be adversely affected.\nAny indebtedness we incur could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to expand our business or respond to changes, and we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy any of our debt service obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $26.2 million outstanding indebtedness under our revolving line of credit and may incur indebtedness in the future, including any additional borrowings available under our revolving line of credit. Any substantial indebtedness, and the fact that a substantial portion of our cash flow from operating activities could be needed to make payments on this indebtedness, could have adverse consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nreducing the availability of our cash flow for our operations, capital expenditures, future business opportunities and other purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that may have less debt;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional funds; and\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions.\nOur ability to borrow any funds needed to operate and expand our business will depend in part on our ability to generate cash. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities or if future borrowings, under our revolving credit facility or otherwise, are not available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs, our operating results, financial condition and ability to expand our business and meet our risk-based capital requirements may be adversely affected.\nWe may have additional tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to income tax, premium tax, transaction tax and other taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, premium tax, transaction tax and other taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Further, we often make elections for tax purposes which may ultimately not be upheld. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation in the jurisdictions where we are subject to taxation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which that determination is made.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $130.3 million that will begin to expire in 2027. Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change income taxes may be limited. In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by \u201c5-percent stockholders\u201d that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. Pursuant to Sections 382 and 383 of the Code, annual use of our net operating loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards may be limited by previous and future ownership changes.\nChanges in the economy may negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur business may be affected by changes in the economic environment. Medical insurance for cats and dogs is a discretionary\npurchase, and members may reduce or eliminate their discretionary spending during an economic downturn, resulting in an increase in terminations and a reduction in the number of new member enrollments. We may experience a material increase in terminations or a material reduction in our member retention rate in the future, especially in the event of a prolonged recessionary period or a downturn in economic conditions. Conversely, consumers may have more income to pay veterinary costs out-of-pocket and less desire to purchase our subscription during a period of economic growth. In addition, media prices may increase during a period of economic growth, which could increase our sales and marketing expenses. As a result, our business, operating results and financial condition may be significantly affected by changes in the economic environment.\nWe are expanding our operations internationally, and we may therefore become subject to a number of risks associated with international expansion and operations.\nAs part of our growth plan, we have explored, and expect to continue to explore, opportunities to expand our operations internationally. For instance, we recently entered the Australian market through a joint venture and we may enter other countries. We have no history of marketing, selling, administrating and supporting our subscription for consumers outside of the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico. In general, international sales and operations may be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nregulatory rules and practices, foreign exchange controls, tariffs, tax laws and treaties that are different than those we operate under currently;\n\u2022\nthe costs and resources required to modify our subscription appropriately to suit the needs and expectations of residents and veterinarians in such foreign countries;\n\u2022\nour data analytics platform may have limited applicability in foreign countries, which may impact our ability to develop adequate underwriting criteria and accurately price subscriptions in such countries;\n\u2022\nincreased expenses incurred in establishing and maintaining office space and equipment for our international operations;\n\u2022\ntechnological incompatibility between our patented proprietary software and software used by veterinarians;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in modifying our business model or subscription in a manner suitable for any particular foreign country, including any modifications to our Territory Partner model to the extent we determine that our existing model is not suitable for use in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nour lack of experience in marketing to consumers and veterinarians and online marketing in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nour relative lack of industry connections in many foreign countries;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing operations due to language barriers, distance and time zone differences, staffing, cultural differences and business infrastructure constraints, including difficulty in obtaining foreign and domestic visas;\n\u2022\nthe uncertainty of protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and political conditions in these foreign markets.\nThese and other factors could harm our ability to gain future international revenue and, consequently, materially impact our business and operating results. The expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional international markets will require significant management attention and financial resources, detracting from management attention and financial resources otherwise available to our existing business. Our failure to successfully manage our international operations and the associated risks effectively could limit the future growth of our business and could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Compliance with Laws and Regulations\nWe may not maintain the amount of risk-based capital required to avoid additional regulatory oversight, which may adversely affect our ability to operate our business.\nMemberships in our U.S. subscription product are underwritten by APIC. APIC is an insurance company domiciled in the state of New York and licensed by the New York Department of Financial Services (NY DFS). Regulators in the states in which we do business impose risk-based capital requirements on APIC that generally are approved by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) to ensure APIC maintains reasonably appropriate levels of surplus to protect our members against adverse developments in APIC\u2019s financial circumstances, taking into account the risk characteristics of our assets, liabilities and certain other items. Generally, state insurance regulators will compare, on an annual basis as of December 31 or more often as deemed necessary, an insurer\u2019s total adjusted capital and surplus to assess an insurer\u2019s capital adequacy. If an insurer\u2019s risk-based capital falls below a specific threshold, the regulator may take action, which can range from directing an insurer to propose a plan to increase its capital to an acceptable level to placing the insurer under regulatory control.\nApplicable regulations regarding risk-based capital may change, and/or the NY DFS may increase APIC\u2019s required levels of risk-based capital in the future. Regardless, we anticipate that we will need to maintain greater amounts of risk-based capital if our pet enrollment continues to grow. Additionally, a reduction in our risk-based capital may result in a breach of various contractual relationships, including, for example, with the unaffiliated general agents for which we write pet insurance policies, which may give such parties the ability to cancel their contracts with us and/or sue us for damages related to our risk-based\ncapital levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe may require additional capital to meet our risk-based capital requirements, pursue our business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances. If capital is not available to us at any time, our business, operating results and financial condition may be harmed.\nWe may require additional capital to meet our risk-based capital requirements, operate or expand our business or respond to unforeseen circumstances. Additional funds may not be available when we need them, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible securities, the percentage ownership of holders of our common stock could be significantly diluted and these newly issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. Further, volatility in the credit or equity markets may have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain debt or equity financing or the cost of such financing. Similarly, our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us. If a combination of these factors were to occur, our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient and, in such case, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms. If funds are unavailable to us on reasonable terms when we need them, we may be unable to meet our risk-based capital requirements, train and support our employees, support Territory Partners, maintain the competitiveness of our technology, pursue business opportunities, service our existing debt, pay veterinary invoices or acquire new members, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur business is heavily regulated, and if we fail to comply with the numerous applicable laws and regulations our business and operating results could be harmed.\nThe sale of medical insurance for cats and dogs, which is considered a type of property and casualty insurance in most jurisdictions, is heavily regulated by federal, state, provincial and territorial governments in each jurisdiction in which we operate. In the United States, state insurance regulators are charged with protecting policyholders and have broad regulatory, supervisory and administrative powers over our business practices. Because we do business in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, all Canadian provinces and territories, and Puerto Rico, compliance with insurance-related laws, rules and regulations is difficult and imposes significant costs on our business. Each jurisdiction\u2019s insurance department typically has the power, among other things, to:\n\u2022\ngrant and revoke licenses to transact insurance business;\n\u2022\nconduct inquiries into the insurance-related activities and conduct of agents and agencies and others in the sales, marketing and promotional channels;\n\u2022\nrequire and regulate disclosure in connection with the sale and solicitation of insurance policies;\n\u2022\nauthorize how, by which personnel and under what circumstances insurance premiums can be quoted and published and an insurance policy sold;\n\u2022\nregulate how sales incentives may be structured;\n\u2022\nregulate the content of insurance-related advertisements, including web pages, and other marketing practices;\n\u2022\napprove policy forms, require specific benefits and benefit levels;\n\u2022\nregulate premium rates;\n\u2022\nimpose fines and other penalties; and\n\u2022\nimpose continuing education requirements.\nWhile the U.S. federal government does not directly regulate the insurance industry, federal legislation and administrative policies can also affect us. Congress and various federal agencies periodically discuss proposals that would provide for federal oversight of insurance companies. We cannot predict whether any such laws will be enacted or the effect that such laws would have on our business. We also do business in all ten provinces and three territories of Canada. The provincial and territorial insurance regulators have the power to regulate the market conduct of insurers and insurance intermediaries, and the licensing and supervision of insurance agents, and brokers, along with enforcement rights, including the right to assess administrative monetary penalties in certain provinces.\nInsurance companies are also regulated at the federal level in Canada, and the Insurance Companies Act prohibits a foreign entity from insuring risks in Canada unless it is authorized by an Order made by the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (Canada) permitting it to do so.\nDue to the complexity, periodic modification and differing interpretations of insurance laws and regulations, we have not always been, and we may not always be, in compliance with them. A regulator\u2019s interpretation of existing laws or regulations may change without notice. Failure to comply with insurance laws, regulations and guidelines or other laws and regulations applicable to our business could result in significant liability, additional department of insurance licensing requirements, the revocation of licenses in a particular jurisdiction or our inability to sell subscriptions, which could significantly increase our operating expenses, result in the loss of our revenue and otherwise harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nMoreover, because adverse regulatory actions in one jurisdiction must be reported to other jurisdictions, an adverse regulatory action in one jurisdiction could result in penalties and adversely affect our license status or reputation in other jurisdictions.\nEven if the allegations in any regulatory or other action against us ultimately are determined to be unfounded, we could incur significant time and expense defending against the allegations, and any related negative publicity could harm consumer and third-party confidence in us, which could significantly damage our brand.\nIn addition, we have received, and may in the future receive, inquiries from regulators regarding our marketing and business practices. These inquires may include investigations regarding a number of our business practices, including the manner in which we market and sell subscriptions, the manner in which we write policies for any unaffiliated general agent, and whether any amounts we pay to hospitals or hospital groups is appropriate. Any modification of our marketing or business practices in response to regulatory inquiries could harm our business, operating results or financial condition and lead to reputational harm.\nStates may adopt new laws that may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nThe NAIC may draft model laws that focus on medical insurance for pets. States may enact new laws to adopt what the NAIC drafts, or a state may enact its own new laws or regulations that could affect our industry. Many states have and may continue to consider proposed legislation that could significantly affect our operations, including, for example, our ability to effect rate increases, to cancel or not issue existing policies, or how to market our product. Implementing changes in order to comply with new laws or regulations could also be time-consuming and costly.\nWe may not receive approval for changes to an existing product, for a proposed new product, for pricing changes, or we may not receive such approvals in a timely manner.\nMost states require licensure and regulatory approval prior to marketing new insurance products or changing premiums for existing products. From time to time, we seek to make updates to our existing subscription product. We may also introduce new products that make changes that are more extensive to the product approved in a state. With respect to pricing, our practice has been to regularly reevaluate the price of our subscriptions, with any pricing changes implemented at least annually, subject to the review and approval of the state regulators, who may reduce or disallow our pricing changes. Such review has often in the past resulted, and may in the future result, in delayed implementation of pricing changes and prevent us from making changes we believe are necessary to achieve our targeted payout ratio, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. A delayed approval may require us to raise rates more quickly than we otherwise may desire. This could damage our reputation with our members and reduce our retention rates, which could significantly damage our brand, result in the loss of expected revenue and otherwise harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may be affected by mandatory participation in plans that could result in contributions from insurance subsidiaries we own.\nCertain states have enacted laws that require a property-casualty insurer, which includes a pet insurance company, conducting business in that state to participate in assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities, joint underwriting associations (JUAs), Fair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR) plans and wind pools. In these markets, if the state reinsurance facilities, wind pools, FAIR plans or JUAs recognize a financial deficit, they may in turn have the ability to assess participating insurers, adversely affecting our operating results and financial condition if we are a part of such state reinsurance facilities, wind pools, FAIR plans or JUAs. Additionally, certain states require insurers to participate in guaranty funds for impaired or insolvent insurance companies. These funds periodically assess losses against all insurance companies doing business in the state. Our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected by any of these factors.\nRegulations that require individuals or entities that sell medical insurance for cats and dogs or process claims to be licensed may be interpreted to apply to our business more broadly than we expect them to, which could require us to modify our business practices, create liabilities, damage our reputation, and harm our business.\nInsurance regulations generally require that each individual who sells, solicits or negotiates insurance on our behalf must maintain a valid license in the jurisdiction in which the activity occurs. Regulations also generally prohibit paying an insurance commission to an unlicensed person or entity. Regulations may also require certain individuals who process claims to be licensed. These requirements are subject to a variety of interpretations between jurisdictions. We may not interpret and apply the requirements in the same manner as all applicable regulators, and, even if we have, the requirements or regulatory interpretations of those requirements may change. Regulators have in the past and/or may in the future determine that certain of our personnel or third parties were performing licensable activities without the required license, including for example a veterinary hospital employee. If such persons were not in fact licensed in any such jurisdiction, we could become subject to conviction for an offense or the imposition of an administrative penalty, and liable for significant penalties. Regulators may also deem payments we make to an unlicensed entity or person to be improper. We would also likely be required to modify our business practices and/or sales and marketing programs, or license the affected individuals, which may be impractical or costly and time-consuming to implement. Any modification of our business or marketing practices in response to regulatory licensing requirements could harm our business, operating results or financial condition.\nWe are subject to numerous laws and regulations, and compliance with one law or regulation may result in non-compliance with another.\nWe are subject to numerous laws and regulations that are administered and enforced by a number of different governmental authorities, each of which exercises a degree of interpretive latitude, including, in the United States, state insurance regulators, state securities administrators, state attorneys general and federal agencies including the SEC, Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Department of Justice. Consequently, we are subject to the risk that compliance with any particular regulator\u2019s or enforcement authority\u2019s interpretation of a legal issue may not result in compliance with another\u2019s interpretation of the same issue, particularly when compliance is judged in hindsight. In addition, there is risk that laws and regulations or any particular regulator\u2019s or enforcement authority\u2019s interpretation of a legal issue may change over time to our detriment, or that changes in the overall legal environment may, even absent any particular regulator\u2019s or enforcement authority\u2019s interpretation of a legal issue changing, cause us to change our views regarding the actions we need to take from a legal risk management perspective, thus necessitating changes to our practices that may, in some cases, increase our costs and limit our ability to grow or to improve the profitability of our business. Further, in some cases, these laws and regulations are designed to protect or benefit the interests of a specific constituency rather than a range of constituencies. For example, state insurance laws and regulations generally are intended to protect or benefit purchasers or users of insurance products, not holders of securities, which generally is the jurisdiction of the SEC. In many respects, these laws and regulations limit our ability to grow or to improve the profitability of our business.\nFailure to comply with federal, state and provincial laws and regulations relating to privacy and security of personal information, and civil liabilities relating to breaches of privacy and security of personal information, could create liabilities for us, damage our reputation and harm our business.\nA variety of U.S. and Canadian federal, state and provincial laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of personal information. Claims or allegations that we have violated applicable laws or regulations related to privacy and data security could in the future result in negative publicity and a loss of confidence in us by our members and our participating service providers, and may subject us to fines by credit card companies and the loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments. In addition, we have posted privacy policies and practices concerning the collection, use and disclosure of member data on our website. Several Internet companies have incurred penalties for failing to abide by the representations made in their privacy policies and practices. In addition, our use and retention of personal information could lead to civil liability exposure in the event of any disclosure of such information due to hacking, viruses, inadvertent action or other use or disclosure. Several companies have been subject to civil actions, including class actions, relating to this exposure.\nWe have incurred, and will continue to incur, expenses to comply with privacy and security standards and protocols for personal information imposed by law, regulation, self-regulatory bodies, industry standards and contractual obligations. Such laws, standards and regulations, however, are evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations, and federal, state and provincial legislative and regulatory bodies may expand current or enact new laws or regulations regarding privacy matters. We are unable to predict what additional legislation, standards or regulation in the area of privacy and security of personal information could be enacted or its effect on our operations and business.\nLaw and regulations of the Internet, email and texting could adversely affect our business.\nMany laws governing general commerce on the Internet remain unsettled and it may take years to fully determine whether and how existing laws such as those governing insurance, intellectual property, privacy and taxation apply to the Internet. In addition, the growth and development of the market for electronic commerce and Internet-related pet insurance advertisements and transactions may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business and selling subscriptions over the Internet. Any new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations relating to the Internet could harm our business and we could be forced to incur substantial costs in order to comply with them, which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nAdditionally, we use phone solicitation, email and texting to market our services to potential members and/or as a means of communicating with our existing members. The laws and regulations governing the use of phone solicitation, email and texting continue to evolve, and the growth and development of the market for commerce over the Internet may lead to the adoption of additional legislation. Failure to comply with existing or new laws regarding phone solicitation, text or electronic communications with members could lead to significant damages. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, expenses in our efforts to comply with electronic messaging laws. If new laws or regulations are adopted, or existing laws and regulations are interpreted, to impose additional restrictions on our ability to send email to our members or potential members, we may not be able to communicate with them in a cost-effective manner. In addition to legal restrictions on the use of email for commercial purposes, Internet and email service providers and others attempt to block the transmission of unsolicited email, commonly known as \u201cspam.\u201d Many service providers have relationships with organizations whose purpose it is to detect and notify the Internet and email service providers of entities that the organization believes are sending unsolicited email. If an Internet or email service provider identifies messaging and email from us as \u201cspam\u201d as a result of reports from these organizations or otherwise, we could be placed on a restricted list that will block our emails to members or potential members. If we are restricted or unable to communicate by phone, text or email with our members and potential members as a result of legislation, blockage or otherwise, our business, operating results and financial condition would be harmed.\nApplicable insurance laws regarding the change in control of our company may impede potential acquisitions that our stockholders might consider to be desirable.\nWe are subject to statutes and regulations of the state of New York that generally require that any person or entity desiring to acquire direct or indirect control of APIC obtain prior regulatory approval. These laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent a change in control of our company, including through transactions, and in particular unsolicited transactions, that some of our stockholders might consider to be desirable. Similar laws or regulations may also apply in other states in which we may operate.\nOur segregated account in Bermuda, WICL segregated account AX, could be adversely impacted by regulatory compliance of an unaffiliated third party.\nWyndham Insurance Company (SAC) Limited (WICL) is a class 3 insurer regulated by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA). WICL\u2019s ability to continue operations and pay dividends could impact the ability of our segregated account to do the same. WICL\u2019s failure to meet regulatory requirements set forth by the BMA could result in our inability to transact business with WICL segregated account AX. Further, WICL could be limited from allowing dividends to be paid out of segregated account AX in the event of adverse regulatory actions.\nOur accounting is becoming more complex, and relies upon estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies. If our accounting is erroneous or based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect, our operating results could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in our stock price.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, and also to comply with many complex requirements and standards. We devote substantial resources to compliance with accounting requirements and we base our estimates on our best judgment, historical experience, information derived from third parties, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. However, various factors are causing our accounting to become complex, such as our recent building acquisition, our investments in strategic opportunities and our test expansion into foreign markets. Ongoing evolution of our business may compound these complexities. Our operating results may be adversely affected if we make accounting errors or our judgments prove to be wrong, assumptions change or actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors or guidance we may have provided, resulting in a decline in our stock price and potential legal claims. Significant judgments, assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, business combinations, and income taxes.\nOur reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change and could affect our compliance with financial debt covenants.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance.\nFrom time to time we have released, and may continue to release, guidance in our quarterly earnings conference call, quarterly earnings releases, or otherwise, regarding our future performance that represents our management\u2019s estimates as of the date of release. This guidance, which includes forward-looking statements, has been and will be based on projections prepared by our management. These projections are not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and neither our registered public accountants nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles or examines the projections. Accordingly, no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect to the projections.\nProjections are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change. We intend to state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed but are not intended to imply that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges. The principal reason that we release guidance is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors. We do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such third parties.\nGuidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions underlying the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results. Accordingly, our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release. Actual results may vary from our guidance and the variations may be material. In light of the foregoing, investors are urged not to rely upon our guidance in making an investment decision regarding our common stock.\nAny failure to successfully implement our operating strategy or the occurrence of any of the events or circumstances set forth in this report could result in the actual operating results being different from our guidance, and the differences may be adverse and material.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research, about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the securities or industry analysts who publish research about us or our business downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable evaluations of our company or our stock, the price of our stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company, our stock may lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile, and you may be unable to sell your shares at or above the price at which you purchased them.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to fluctuate widely. Factors affecting the market price of our common stock include:\n\u2022\nvariations in our operating results, earnings per share, cash flows from operating activities, and key operating metrics, and how those results compare to analyst expectations;\n\u2022\nforward-looking guidance that we provide to the public and industry and financial analysts related to future revenue and profitability, and any change in that guidance or our failure to achieve the results reflected in that guidance;\n\u2022\nthe net increases in the number of members, either independently or as compared with published expectations of industry, financial or other analysts that cover our company;\n\u2022\nannouncements of changes to our subscription, strategic alliances, acquisitions or significant agreements by us or by our competitors;\n\u2022\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nthe economy as a whole and market conditions in our industry;\n\u2022\ntrading activity by a limited number of stockholders who together beneficially own a majority of our outstanding common stock;\n\u2022\nthe number of shares of our stock trading on a regular basis; and\n\u2022\nany other factors discussed in these risk factors.\nIn addition, if the market for stock in our industry or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence, the market price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition. Some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation. If we are the subject of such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, therefore, any returns will be limited to the value of our stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. Other than potential repurchases of our common stock, we currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. In addition, our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock is limited by the terms of our credit agreement, APIC\u2019s ability to pay dividends is limited by New York state insurance laws, and WICL Segregated Account AX\u2019s ability to pay dividends is limited by our agreements with WICL as well as WICL\u2019s regulatory requirements. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the increase, if any, of our stock price.\nOur directors and principal stockholders own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nOur directors, five percent or greater stockholders and their respective affiliates beneficially hold a significant amount of our outstanding voting stock. Therefore, these stockholders have the ability to influence us through this ownership position. These stockholders may be able to determine all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, these stockholders may be able to control elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you or other stockholders may feel are in your or their best interest as one of our stockholders.\nProvisions in our restated certificate of incorporation, restated bylaws and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the market price of our common stock.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions, among other things:\n\u2022\nestablish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board are elected at one time;\n\u2022\npermit only the board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill vacancies on the board;\n\u2022\nprovide that directors may only be removed \u201cfor cause\u201d and only with the approval of two-thirds of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nrequire super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws;\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that our board could use to implement a stockholder rights plan (also known as a \u201cpoison pill\u201d);\n\u2022\neliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibit cumulative voting; and\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. Section 203 imposes certain restrictions on mergers, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15% or more of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 14782, "SIC": 6324, "TIC": "TRUP"}
