{"cik": "1196501", "company": "HMS HOLDINGS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-06-06", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to significant risks, including the risks and uncertainties described below. You should carefully consider these risks, as well as the other information in this 2016 Form 10-K, including our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes. The occurrence of any of these risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows in a material way.\nRisks Relating to Our Company\nOur ability to expand our business will be adversely affected if we fail to implement our growth strategy.\nThe size and the scope of our business operations have expanded over the past several years, and we currently intend to continue to grow and expand into new areas within the government and commercial healthcare space; however, such growth and expansion carries costs and risks that, if not properly managed, could adversely affect our business. Our future growth will depend, among other things, on our ability to successfully execute our business plans and continued efforts to improve our operations, all while remaining competitive. We must also be flexible and responsive to our customers\u2019 needs and to changes in the political, economic and regulatory environment in which we operate. The greater size and complexity of our expanding business puts additional strain on our administrative, operational and financial resources and can make optimal resource allocation more difficult to determine. We may not be able to maintain or accelerate our growth. A failure to anticipate or properly address the demands and challenges that our growth strategy and potential diversification may have on our resources and existing infrastructure may result in unanticipated costs and inefficiencies and could negatively impact our ability to execute on our business plans and growth goals, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we fail to innovate and develop new or enhanced solutions and services, or if these solutions and services are not adopted by our customers, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nPart of our growth strategy depends on our ability to respond to the evolving healthcare landscape with new and enhanced solutions and services that our existing and potential customers are willing to adopt. The development, marketing and implementation of these solutions and services may require that we make substantial financial and resource investments. We face risks that our new or modified solutions and services may not be responsive to customer preferences or industry changes, and that the solution and service development initiatives that we prioritize may not yield the gains that we anticipate, if any. If we are unable to predict market preferences or healthcare industry changes, or if we are unable to develop or adapt solutions and services that are responsive to existing and potential customers\u2019 needs, we may fail to expand our business, which could constrain our future revenue growth and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur acquisition strategy may subject us to considerable business and financial risk.\nHistorically, to achieve our strategic goals, we have made a significant number of acquisitions that have expanded the solutions and services we offer, provided a presence in complementary business lines, or expanded our geographic presence and/or customer base. For example, we acquired IntegriGuard, LLC in September 2009; Verify Solutions, Inc. in December 2009; Allied Management Group-Special Investigation Unit in June 2010; Chapman Kelly, Inc. in August 2010; HDI in December 2011; MedRecovery Management, LLC in December 2012; Essette, Inc. in September 2016; and Eliza Holding Corp. in April 2017.\nWe intend to pursue future acquisitions that will continue to expand and diversify our business and to periodically engage in discussions regarding such possible acquisitions. We are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to our ability to identify suitable potential acquisition candidates, to consummate additional acquisitions that will be advantageous to us, and to successfully integrate future acquisitions. Future and potential business acquisitions involve a number of risk factors that could affect our operations, including, but not limited to:\n\u00a7 diversion of management\u2019s attention and other resources;\n\u00a7 our ability to integrate operational, accounting and technology functions, policies, processes, systems and controls, and to implement these functions, policies, processes, systems and controls, without incurring substantial expenses, delays or other issues;\n\u00a7 our ability to integrate personnel and human resource systems as well as the cultures of the acquired business;\n\u00a7 our ability to retain or replace the key personnel of the acquired business;\n\u00a7 our ability to maintain relationships with the customers of the acquired business and further develop the acquired business;\n\u00a7 our ability to cross-sell our solutions and services and the solutions and services of the acquired business to our respective customers;\n\u00a7 customer dissatisfaction or performance problems with the acquired business;\n\u00a7 our ability to comply with regulatory requirements and avoid potential conflicts of interest in markets that we serve;\n\u00a7 the misuse of intellectual property by the personnel of the acquired business;\n\u00a7 our ability to successfully enter into unfamiliar markets;\n\u00a7 assumption of unanticipated legal or financial liabilities and/or negative publicity related to prior acts by the acquired business;\n\u00a7 we may become subject to litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired business, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former shareholders or third parties;\n\u00a7 we may become significantly leveraged as a result of incurring debt to finance an acquisition;\n\u00a7 we may encounter unanticipated operating, accounting or management difficulties in connection with the acquired business;\n\u00a7 the acquired business may not perform as projected which could negatively impact earnings or contingent consideration;\n\u00a7 we may suffer impairment of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets; and\n\u00a7 we may suffer dilution to our earnings per share.\nIf we fail to adequately address these risks, or to successfully integrate the businesses that we acquire, we may not realize cost efficiencies, synergies or other benefits that we anticipated when selecting our acquisition candidates, and our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nYou will not be able to rely on our operating results in any particular period as an indication of our future performance because they are subject to significant fluctuation which may cause the market price of our common stock to decrease significantly.\nOur operating results may fail to match our past or projected performance. We have experienced significant variations in our revenue between reporting periods due to the timing of periodic revenue recovery projects, the timing and delays in third party payers\u2019 claim adjudication and ultimate payment to our customers where our revenue is contingent upon such collections and delays in receiving payment for our services. Our revenue and operating results have also been impacted from period to period as a result of a number of factors, some of which are outside of our control, including, but not limited to:\n\u00a7 fluctuations in sales activity given our sales cycle;\n\u00a7 the commencement, completion or termination of contracts during any particular quarter;\n\u00a7 expenses related to certain contracts which may be incurred in periods prior to revenue being recognized;\n\u00a7 the timing of government contract awards;\n\u00a7 the time required to resolve bid protests;\n\u00a7 contract renewal discussions, which result in delayed payments for services already performed;\n\u00a7 technological and operational issues affecting our customers, including delays in payment receipt for previously recognized revenue due to delays in certain customers processing our findings through their systems;\n\u00a7 adjustments to age/quality of receivables and accruals as a result of delays involving contract limitations and changes or sub-contractor performance deficiencies or internal managerial decision not to pursue identified claim revenue from customers; and\n\u00a7 regulatory changes or general economic conditions as they affect healthcare providers and payers.\nOccasionally our state and federal customers are requested by third party payers to refund payments that we previously recovered for our customers. If our state and federal customers choose to refund money in response to these requests, regardless of whether an error actually occurred in connection with the payments, we may also be required to return contingent revenue which we were previously paid associated with such refunded payments. We also typically face a long implementation period with a new customer or a new contract with an existing customer and may not be able to estimate with certainty the period in which implementation may be completed.\nWe cannot predict the extent to which future variations could occur due to these or other factors. Although we have experienced some seasonal trends in our operational volume, we do not consider our operations to be seasonal to any material degree. Consequently, our operating results are subject to significant fluctuation for any particular quarter, fiscal year, or other period, and may not be indicative of future periods. Significant fluctuations in our operating results may cause the market price of our common stock to decrease significantly.\nWe face challenges associated with forecasting the revenue under our contracts and solutions, and any failure to accurately forecast such revenue could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to accurately estimate the factors upon which we base our contract pricing, or the costs and timing for implementing and completing contracts. For a majority of our customer contracts, the payment of our fee is contingent upon the recoveries received by our customers. We also have cost-plus or time-and-material based contracts with the federal government where our revenue is recognized based on costs incurred plus an estimate of the negotiated fee earned. Our ability to earn a profit on these contracts requires that we accurately estimate the costs involved with these contracts and assess the probability of achieving certain outcomes or milestones within the contracted time period. In addition, we cannot predict with certainty the costs or the period in which implementation or contracts may be completed when we introduce new solutions or services into the marketplace. We may also face a long implementation period with a new customer or a new contract, making it difficult to reliably forecast revenue under those contracts. If we do not accurately estimate the costs and timing for completing projects, or if we encounter increased or unexpected costs, delays, failures, liabilities or risks, including those outside of our control, our contracts could prove unprofitable for us or yield lower profit margins than anticipated. Although we believe that we have recorded adequate provisions in our financial statements for losses on our fixed-price and cost-plus contracts where applicable, as required under U.S. GAAP, our contract loss provisions may not be adequate to cover all actual future losses.\nSystem interruptions or failures could expose us to liability and harm our business.\nOur data and operation centers are essential to our business and our operations depend on our ability to maintain and protect our information systems. We attempt to mitigate the potential adverse effects of a disruption, relocation or change in operating environment; however, the situations we plan for and the amount of insurance coverage that we maintain may not be adequate in every case. Despite systems redundancy and security measures, our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from, among other sources:\n\u00a7 power loss, transmission cable cuts and telecommunications failures;\n\u00a7 damage or interruption caused by fire, earthquake and other natural disasters;\n\u00a7 software defects;\n\u00a7 cyber security breaches; and\n\u00a7 physical break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, terrorist attacks and other events beyond our control.\nIn addition, while there are backup systems in many of our operating facilities, an extended outage of utility or network services supplied by third party IT vendors or providers may delay or disrupt the delivery or performance of the solutions and services we provide for our customers. If we encounter a business interruption, or in the event our business continuity plans and business interruption insurance coverage are not adequate or fail to compensate us on a timely basis, we could suffer operational disruptions, disputes with customers, civil or criminal penalties, regulatory problems, increases in administrative expenses, loss of our ability to produce timely and accurate financial and other reports or other adverse consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur systems and networks and those of third parties on which we rely may be subject to cyber security breaches and other disruptions that could compromise our information and harm our business.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we rely heavily upon our technology systems and networks to input, maintain and communicate the confidential and proprietary data we receive on behalf of our customers, as well as third-party products and services. In addition, sub-contractors, teaming partners or other third-party vendors may receive or utilize this information on our behalf. The secure processing and maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Our security measures or those of third parties on which we rely could be compromised or breached as a result of computer hacking, acts of vandalism or theft, malware, computer viruses, employee error or malfeasance, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. As a result, our data, customers\u2019 data, information technology or infrastructure could be accessed improperly, made unavailable, improperly modified, or corrupted or we could suffer system disruptions, shutdowns and denials of service. The occurrence of any of these events could cause our solutions and services to be perceived as vulnerable, cause our customers to lose confidence in our solutions and services, negatively affect our ability to attract new customers, cause existing customers to terminate or not renew our solutions and services and damage our reputation, all of which could reduce our revenue, increase our expenses and expose us to legal claims and regulatory actions. Similarly, we could be materially adversely affected by the loss of proprietary, trade secret or confidential technical and financial data if our internal networks are compromised. We may be unable to implement adequate preventive measures to protect against such compromises. We could also be forced to expend significant resources in response to a cyber-security breach, including repairing system damage, increasing cyber security protection costs by deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, paying regulatory fines and litigating and resolving legal claims and regulatory actions, all of which could increase our expenses, divert the attention of our management and key personnel away from our business operations and materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf we are unable to protect our proprietary technology, information, processes, know-how, and other intellectual property and intellectual property rights, or become subject to claims of infringing or misappropriating the intellectual property of third parties, the value of our solutions and services may be diminished and our business may be materially adversely affected.\nOur success as a company depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. Our expanding operations and efforts to develop new solutions and services also make protection of our intellectual property more critical. We seek to protect trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with employees, consultants and other third parties, as well as through the terms of our agreements with customers and vendors, and other security measures. However, the steps we have taken to deter misappropriation of intellectual property may be insufficient to protect our proprietary information. Misappropriation of our intellectual property by third parties, or any disclosure or dissemination of our confidential and proprietary business intelligence, queries, algorithms and other similar information by any means, could undermine any competitive advantage we currently derive or may derive from that intellectual property. For example, our current or former employees, consultants or other third parties may unintentionally or willfully disclose our trade secrets, know-how or other confidential and proprietary information to competitors. Competitors have also attempted to use state open records and/or federal Freedom of Information Act laws to obtain our proposal responses and other documents we provide to our government customers. We cannot be certain that our efforts to protect the confidential and proprietary trade secret information or intellectual property in these proposals or other documents will always be successful, due to the many factors underlying the various state and federal decisions to release information in response to open records requests (even in spite of our objections and efforts to protection information). On the other hand, third parties may claim that we are infringing upon or misappropriating their intellectual property. Our exposure to risks related to the use of intellectual property may also increase as a result of acquisitions because third parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology. Any of these situations could cause us to expend significant time and resources and to incur substantial costs associated with litigation or legal proceedings that may be necessary to defend ourselves or to enforce our intellectual property rights, in which we may not ultimately prevail, and could result in our being prevented from furnishing certain solutions and services. If the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use or appropriation by third parties or our employees, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished and others may be able to more effectively compete with our business by offering solutions or concepts that are substantially similar to ours, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe face significant competition for our solutions and services and we expect competition to increase, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe market for healthcare cost containment solutions and services is intensely competitive, driven by rapidly changing technologies, evolving industry standards and customer demands to become more efficient. Our competitors range in size from large, diversified national companies to small, specialized firms, and could include current or former sub-contractors or teaming partners seeking to establish direct relationships with our customers in order to perform similar services as the prime contractor, as well as current and prospective customers that elect to perform recovery and cost avoidance functions in-house or to develop in-house capacities for solutions and services that we provide or hope to provide. Consolidation among vendors and healthcare providers, as well as the merging of some of our competitors or formation of business alliances with other competitors, have contributed to the increasingly competitive environment. For example, certain state customers have combined or \u201cbundled\u201d TPL services under large-scale IT procurements, allowing MMIS vendors to partner with less experienced TPL identification vendors based on preferred relationships or favorable pricing. In addition, companies that have invested in proprietary technology different from our own solution and service offerings, such as front-end analytics, have emerged as new competitors due to the rapidly evolving healthcare landscape. There is also increasing sophistication in the solutions and services that our competitors are developing that may become more efficient or appealing to our customers. In order to remain competitive, we may need to quickly develop and market new and enhanced solutions and services responsive to emerging technologies and changes in the healthcare industry, which may require that we make substantial financial and resource investments.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully against our existing or future competitors. Some of these competitors have significantly greater financial and technical resources and market recognition than we do. They may be able to (i) offer lower prices or negotiate fee reductions on our current solutions and services, (ii) respond more quickly than we can to new and emerging technologies and changing customer requirements, (iii) devote greater resources to the sale of their solutions and services and the development and implementation of new and improved systems, solutions and services for customers that we serve, and (iv) pursue various acquisitions that allow them to rapidly amass a wide array of capabilities. We may be forced to lower our pricing, unexpectedly increase or enhance our technological or data capabilities, or modify our solution or service offerings. Notwithstanding any changes we make in response to increased competition, the demand for our solutions and services may decrease as a result of increased competition. A failure to be responsive to our existing and potential customers\u2019 needs or the changing industry landscape could hinder our ability to maintain or expand our customer base, hire and retain new employees, pursue new business opportunities, complete future acquisitions and operate our business effectively. Any inability to compete effectively could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business could be materially adversely affected if we fail to maintain a high level of customer retention, if our customers elect to reduce the scope of our contracts or terminate them before their scheduled expiration dates or if we fail to meet performance standards under our customer contracts.\nWe historically have derived and expect to continue to generate a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of large customers at the federal and state level. Our contracts with these customers are subject to periodic renewal and some permit them to terminate their contracts on short notice, with or without cause. If a customer is dissatisfied with the quality of our work or if we fail to meet performance standards under our contracts, or if our solutions, technical infrastructure or services do not comply with the provisions of our contractual agreements or applicable regulatory requirements, customers might seek to reduce the scope of the services we perform or prematurely terminate their agreements with us, or we could incur additional costs that may impair the profitability of a contract and damage our ability to obtain additional work from that customer, or other current or prospective customers. For example, some of our contracts contain liquidated damages provisions and financial penalties related to performance failures, which if triggered, could materially adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We also may be required to disclose such liquidated damages or other financial penalties assessed against us in connection with future bids for services with other customers.\nIn addition, government customers are subject to financial pressures or pressure from stakeholders that may cause them to terminate contracts for our services that may be regarded as non-essential or to redefine or reduce the scope of our contracts by, for example, significantly reducing the volume of data that we are permitted to audit. Despite our right to prompt and full payment under the terms of our contracts, we could face challenges in obtaining timely or full payments for our properly provided services from our customers. If there is a substantial reduction in the scope of our services under, or a termination of, any of our key contracts with our major customers, or if we are exposed to significant costs, liabilities or negative publicity, our ability to compete for new contracts with current or prospective customers could be damaged and our business, financial condition, reputation, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nAny failure to maintain effective information processing systems and the integrity of the data in, and operations of, those systems could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur ability to conduct our operations and accurately report our financial results depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems and the processes performed by those systems. These information systems and applications require continual maintenance, upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs, satisfy customer requests and handle our expansion and growth. Despite our testing and quality control measures, we cannot be certain that errors or system deficiencies will not be found and that remediation can be done in a timeframe that is acceptable to our customers, or that customer relationships will not be impaired by the occurrence of errors or the need for remediation. In addition, implementation of upgrades and enhancements may cost more, take longer or require more testing than originally expected. Given the large amount of data we collect and manage, it is possible that hardware failures or errors or technical deficiencies in our systems could result in data loss or corruption or cause the information that we collect, utilize or disseminate to be incomplete or contain inaccuracies that our customers regard as significant. Situations may also arise in which the accuracy of our data analysis or the content and quality of our work product is central to the disposition of claims, controversies or litigation between our customers and third parties that would require us to allocate significant resources to fulfilling our contractual obligations to provide our customers with full and complete access to records, analysis and back-up documentation of our work. Assuring our capacity to fulfill these obligations as well as actually fulfilling them could impose significant burdens on our infrastructure for data storage, maintenance and processing, and require us to incur increased costs to supplement our personnel, data storage and computing resources, which could materially and negatively impact other business operations.\nWe depend on many different entities to supply information and an inability to successfully manage our relationships with a number of these suppliers may harm the quality and availability of our solutions and services.\nWe obtain the data used in our solutions and services from many sources, including commercial health insurance plans, financial institutions, managed care organizations, government entities and non-government entities. From time to time, challenges arise in managing and maintaining our relationships with data sources that are not our customers and that furnish information to us pursuant to a combination of voluntary cooperation and legal obligations under laws and regulations that are often subject to differing interpretation. For example, data suppliers could seek to limit or end our access to and use of their data if they determine that certain uses of data for our customers are not permitted by our agreements, or such suppliers may make errors in compiling, transmitting or accurately characterizing data or have technological limitations that interfere with our receipt or use of the data we rely on them to provide. If a number of our information sources become unable or unwilling to provide us with certain data under terms of use that are acceptable to us and our customers, or if laws and regulations for use and protection of this data changes in a way that disincentivizes our suppliers, or imposes unacceptable or unreasonable conditions or risks on us, we may not be able to obtain new or favorable agreements with alternative data suppliers. In addition, our ability to normalize and fully utilize the information we have received from various data sources in order to enhance and improve current solutions for our customers is an important component of our growth strategy. Although we believe that we have the legal and contractual rights necessary to normalize and use the data we have obtained from these sources for potential or contemplated solution and service offerings, we cannot provide assurance that these entities will permit the use of their data for these purposes. If we lose a number of our data sources or access to certain data and are unable to identify and reach the requisite agreements with suitable alternative suppliers or fail to successfully integrate them into our solution and service offerings, or if there is a lack of integrity in the data that current or future suppliers provide, we could experience service disruptions, increased costs, reduced quality of our solutions and services, or performance penalties under our customer contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may rely on sub-contractors and other third party providers to provide customers with a single-source solution or service or we may serve as a sub-contractor to a third party prime contractor. If these parties fail to satisfy their obligations to us or if we are unable to maintain these relationships, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nIn some areas of our business we may engage sub-contractors, teaming partners, vendors or other third party providers to provide our customers with a single-source solution or service for a broader range of service needs. These third parties include software vendors, utility and network providers and other information technology service providers. Our ability to deliver and implement solutions and serve our customers effectively depends on our ability to obtain permissions from our customers, when necessary, to use these third party sub-contractors, or on these third parties meeting our service standards in both timeliness and quality. Similarly, we are and may in the future be engaged as a sub-contractor to a third party prime contractor. Sub-contracting arrangements where we are not the prime contractor pose unique risks to us because we do not have control over the customer relationship, and our ability to generate revenue under such sub-contracts is dependent on the prime contractor, its performance and relationship with the customer, and its relationship with us. While we believe that we perform appropriate due diligence on these parties and take adequate measures to ensure that they comply with the appropriate laws and regulations, we cannot guarantee that they will comply with the terms set forth in their agreements with us or in the case of a prime contractor, their agreement with the customer or that they will provide adequate and timely services, construe their contractual rights and obligations in a reasonable way, act appropriately in dealing with us or customers, and remain in compliance with the relevant laws, rules or regulations. As a result, we may have disputes with these parties arising from these or other matters. Performance deficiencies or misconduct by our prime contractors or sub-contractors may be perceived as inadequacies in our solutions or services or cause us to fail to fulfill our contractual obligations to our customers, which could materially adversely affect our customer relationships and reputation, result in termination of a customer contract or the sub-contractor or partner, and subject us to a dispute with our customer or such third party. In addition, if our third party service providers terminate or refuse to renew their relationships with us or offer their products to us in the future on less advantageous terms, we may not be able to perform or deliver solutions or services for existing customers as expected. Likewise, we could suffer losses in the event a prime contract, under which we serve as a sub-contractor, is terminated, whether for non-performance by the prime contractor or otherwise. Upon any such termination of the prime contract, our sub-contract will similarly terminate, and the resulting contract loss could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe obtain a significant portion of our business through competitive bidding in response to government requests for proposals. Reprocurements and future contracts may not be awarded through this process on the same level or our contract awards may be challenged by interested parties which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn order to market our solutions and services and compete for contracts with existing and potential state and federal customers, we are often required to respond to government-issued RFPs. These RFP responses typically require us to assemble and submit a large volume of information within a rigid timetable, and to accurately estimate our cost structure for servicing the proposed contract, the time required to establish operations and the likely terms of any proposals submitted by our competitors. We may also be required to disclose the occurrence of any negative events suffered by our business, such as customer disputes, a government inquiry or an adverse judgment or settlement in litigation or a legal proceeding, which could impair our ability to win the contract at issue or have a material adverse effect on our reputation in the industry.\nEven if we win these contracts, we may fail to secure favorable contract terms and conditions, or a government\u2019s determination to award us the contract may be challenged by an interested party. Under the state and federal laws and regulations governing procurements of goods and services, challenges and award protests may be filed even if there are no valid legal grounds on which to base the protest. The filing of such challenges could potentially delay the start or implementation of the contract if the government agency determines to withhold a contract award or suspend contract performance while the protest is being considered, or to take corrective action on its own, such as soliciting new bids or terminating the contract award or current procurement. In the event of irregularities, we perceive or learn of in the award or bidding process, we also may be forced to file protests in response to RFP awards to other bidders. Resolution of a protest, even in our favor, could force us to expend considerable funds in disputing the potential award or to incur additional expenses to maintain our ability to timely start implementation, which may cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. In addition, if we are unable to win reprocurements or protests of particular contracts, we may be precluded from entering certain customer markets for the term of the contract awarded to another party. Any failure to continue to obtain contracts in response to government RFPs, to design proposals that result in profitable contracts, to win new contracts or re-procure current contracts after they expire or to prevail in protests or challenges of contract awards could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAdverse judgments or settlements in legal proceedings could materially harm our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nWe are subject and may be a party to lawsuits and other claims that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business, which may include those related to, for example, contracts, sub-contracts, teaming agreements, protection of confidential information or trade secrets, adversary proceedings arising from customer bankruptcies, employment of our workforce and immigration requirements or compliance with any of a wide array of state and federal statutes, rules and regulations that pertain to different aspects of our business. We may also be required to initiate expensive litigation or other proceedings to protect our business interests. There is a risk that we will not be successful or otherwise be able to satisfactorily resolve any pending or future litigation. In addition, litigation and other legal claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\u2019s view of currently pending legal matters may change in the future. Those uncertainties include, but are not limited to, litigation costs and attorneys\u2019 fees, unpredictable judicial or jury decisions and the differing laws and judicial proclivities regarding damage awards among the states in which we operate. Unexpected outcomes in such legal proceedings, or changes in management\u2019s evaluation or predictions of the likely outcomes of such proceedings (possibly resulting in changes in established reserves), could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to deliver our solutions and services efficiently if we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees.\nOur successful delivery of services and solutions is dependent upon our ability to recruit, employ, train and retain skilled personnel. Our ability to maintain our productivity and profitability is limited by our ability to attract and retain the skilled personnel necessary to sustain our business and operations. The success of recruitment and retention strategies depend on a number of factors, including the competitive demands for employees having the skills we need and the level of compensation required to hire and retain such employees. As our business expands and undergoes change, we may also find it difficult to preserve our corporate culture, which could reduce our ability to innovate and operate effectively or result in a loss of experienced personnel. In addition, our customers or competitors may hire away our qualified employees. We may not be able to recruit the appropriate personnel or maintain the personnel necessary to efficiently operate and support our business, and even if our recruitment and retention strategies are successful, our labor costs may increase significantly. Our inability to hire sufficient personnel on a timely basis without significantly increasing our labor costs could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur future success depends, in part, on the continued service of members of our management team.\nOur ability to execute on our business plans and future success requires that we attract, develop, motivate and retain experienced and innovative executive officers and senior managers who have successfully managed, designed or implemented government services programs or information technology projects, or have relevant experience in other sectors of data management or the healthcare industry. These individuals are in great demand and are likely to remain a limited resource in our industry. The loss of services of one or more members of our management team could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, to the extent we lose an executive officer or senior manager, we may incur increased expenses in connection with the hiring, promotion or replacement of these individuals and the transition of leadership and critical knowledge.\nOur outstanding indebtedness could materially adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to operate our business, and we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our debt service obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the outstanding principal balance due under our Credit Agreement was $197.8 million. Our outstanding indebtedness and any additional indebtedness we incur may have important consequences for us, including, without limitation, that: (i) we may be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay the principal of and interest on our indebtedness; (ii) our indebtedness and leverage may increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions, as well as to competitive pressures; (iii) our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and for general corporate and other purposes may be limited; and (iv) our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry may be limited.\nIn addition, our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our outstanding revolving credit facility depends upon our future performance and our ability to generate cash flows. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, we are required to comply with specified financial and operating covenants, which may limit our ability to operate our business as we otherwise might operate it. For example, our obligations may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default, including, without limitation, payment defaults, failure to perform affirmative covenants, failure to refrain from actions or omissions prohibited by negative covenants, the inaccuracy of representations or warranties, cross-defaults, bankruptcy and insolvency related defaults, defaults relating to judgments, defaults due to certain ERISA related events and a change of control default. If not cured, an event of default would result in any amounts outstanding, including any accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable, which would require us to, among other things: seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets, refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness, sell selected assets, and/or reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures. Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt, and any such financing or refinancing might not be available on economically favorable terms or at all. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our debt service obligations or are forced to take additional measures to be able to service our indebtedness, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nChanges in, or interpretations of, tax rules and regulations may materially adversely affect our effective tax rates.\nWe are a United States-based company subject to various federal, state and local tax laws and regulations in multiple U.S. jurisdictions that govern numerous aspects of our business. As we expand our business, we may perform services for new customers located outside of the United States or in a U.S. Territory, which may subject us to foreign tax laws and regulations that could increase our exposure to additional tax liabilities. Unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results of operations. Our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned and taxed, by changes in, or our interpretation of, tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business, by providing services in new jurisdictions, by increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes including impairments of goodwill, by changes in U.S. GAAP or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. Furthermore, the results of the 2016 elections create uncertainty regarding future potential tax law reform.\nIn addition, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other domestic tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result. The final determination of any of these examinations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur health insurance coverage and self-insurance reserves may not cover future claims, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe maintain various insurance policies for company employee health, workers\u2019 compensation, general liability and property damage. We are self-insured for our health plans, and have purchased a fully-insured stop loss policy to help offset our liability for both individual and aggregate claim costs. We are also responsible for losses up to a certain limit for workers\u2019 compensation, general liability and property damage insurance.\nFor policies under which we are responsible for losses, we record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date. Our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors, including historical trends, actuarial assumptions and economic conditions, and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances. Our prior growth could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience. Should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or medical costs increase beyond what was expected, our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and we may be required to record additional expense. Unanticipated changes may also produce materially different amounts of expense than reported under these programs, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, and if we fail to remedy them or other material weaknesses that we may identify in the future, our financial statements could be materially misstated.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. As described in Part II, Item 9A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, management identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 related to the calculation of the estimated liability for appeals balance in connection with our CMS reserve and the valuation of our accounts receivable allowance. These material weaknesses resulted in an immaterial reclassification error in revenue and selling, general and administrative expenses that was corrected prior to issuance of the consolidated financial statements. Until remediated, these material weaknesses could result in misstatements of account balances or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nWe are actively revising and supplementing our control environment and our risk assessment process and the design of our process level controls in order to remediate these material weaknesses, including a set of compensating controls in the near term. We are enhancing and revising the design of controls and procedures to ensure the calculations of the CMS reserve and the accounts receivable allowance properly utilize historical information to derive the period-end balances. Additionally, management will be supplementing the review controls over the CMS reserve and the accounts receivable allowance, and controls over the completeness and accuracy of the data used to calculate the balances, with additional levels of review involving senior members of our accounting department and will assess the need for additional remediation steps.\nWe cannot predict the outcome of our assessment and that of our independent registered public accounting firm in future periods. If our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weaknesses, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal controls are discovered or occur in the future, we may fail to meet our future reporting obligations on a timely basis, our financial statements may contain material misstatements, our operating results or financial condition may be negatively impacted, and we may be subject to litigation and regulatory actions, causing investor perceptions to be adversely affected and potentially resulting in a decline in the market price of our common stock.\nRisks Relating to Our Industry\nOur business could be materially adversely affected by changes in the U.S. healthcare environment or in laws relating to healthcare programs and policies, particularly as they relate to the ACA and the Medicare and Medicaid programs.\nThe healthcare industry in the United States is subject to changing political, economic and regulatory influences that may affect the procurement practices and operations of federal, state and commercial healthcare organizations and agencies. The ACA\u2019s emphasis on program integrity and cost containment, along with its expansion of Medicaid, created new opportunities to grow our business and our service offerings. However, due to a wide range of factors contributing to uncertainty of the healthcare landscape, including, among other factors, the results of the 2016 elections, Congressional activity to repeal the ACA, and the numerous, varying ACA replace measures that may encompass Medicaid, Medicare and commercial insurance, it is difficult to predict its full impact and influence on future changes to healthcare policy. Policies that fundamentally change the financial structure of the Medicaid program, currently funded jointly by the states and the U.S. Federal Government, could result in early termination or non-renewal of our contracts with certain state government customers. Federal changes may also reduce reimbursement rates to states, establish new payment models, increase or decrease government involvement in healthcare, decrease the Medicare RAC Program, or otherwise change the operating environment for our customers. Healthcare organizations may react to such changed circumstances and financial pressures by taking actions to ramp up, curtail or defer their retention of cost containment providers like us, which could impact the demand for our solutions and services. While certain changes may present new opportunities to us, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if efforts to waive, modify or otherwise change the ACA, in whole or in part, are successful, if we are unable to adapt our solutions and services to meet changing requirements or expand service delivery into new areas, or if the demand for our solutions and services is reduced.\nHealthcare spending fluctuations, simplification of the healthcare payment process or other aspects of the healthcare financing system, budgetary pressures and/or programmatic changes diminishing the scope of program benefits, or limiting payment integrity initiatives, could reduce the need for and the price of our solutions and services, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur projections and expectations are premised, in part, upon consistent growth rates in spending in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, the current healthcare financing system and the need for our solutions and services within that existing framework. Our success as a company is based on offering solutions and services that improve the ability of our customers to identify and recover revenue that would otherwise be lost often as a result of procedural inefficiencies and complexities in that system. However, the need for our solutions and services, the price customers are willing to pay for them or the scope and profitability of our contracts could be negatively affected by a number of factors, including a lower than projected growth in Medicare and Medicaid programs due to developments such as the possible repeal of or modification to the ACA, and any action taken to reduce eligibility or services, or reform Medicaid spending. The absence of near-term compliance deadlines effected by the ACA and other legislation could additionally cause our revenue to decline. There can be no certainty that additional incentives will be created in regard to our solutions and services, or that any legislation or regulations that may be adopted would favorably impact our business.\nModifications in provider billing behavior and habits, often in response to the success of our solutions and services or to changes that reduce healthcare spending, could also reduce the profitability of our contracts and reduce the need for our solutions and services. Compounding this are budgetary pressures that may drive changes at the state level. The demand for our solutions and services could also be impacted by other changes in government healthcare programs or in the level of government spending, such as:\n\u00a7 the simplification of the healthcare benefit and payment system through legislative or regulatory changes at the federal or state level (for example, legislative changes impacting the scope of mandatory audits; limiting or reducing the amount of reviewable claims and/or the look-back period for review in areas where we conduct audits);\n\u00a7 unanticipated reductions in the scope of program benefits (such as, for example, state decisions to eliminate coverage of optional Medicaid populations or services or shifting lives into managed care plans); or\n\u00a7 limits placed on ongoing program integrity initiatives.\nFor example, during 2014 and 2015, our recovery audit services under HDI\u2019s existing Medicare RAC contract were limited because of significant delays in procurement activities for the new Medicare RAC contract awards, resulting from, in part, the cancellation of the original and second procurements following the denial of pre-award protests and ongoing litigation regarding certain payment terms proposed by CMS as part of the new Medicare RAC proposals. In October 2016, CMS announced the new awards, including the award of RAC Region 4 to our wholly owned subsidiary. These new Medicare RAC contracts are currently being implemented and we currently expect that audits will begin in Q2 2017. Our existing Medicare RAC contract ends on January 31, 2018, and we are required to maintain certain reserves related to pending appeals for this contract through at least this date. In addition, CMS has shifted the responsibility for initial medical reviews of short inpatient stays from the Medicare RACs to Quality Improvement Organizations, further restricting the Medicare RACs review to a small subset of claims for potential payment inaccuracies. CMS has also implemented new ADR limits for inpatient providers that reduces the ADR requirement to 0.5% under the new contract, down from the 2.0% ADR requirement under the prior contract. This change significantly impacts the volumes of claims Medicare RACs are permitted to review for inpatient providers and reduces their ability to identify overpayments and underpayments under their Medicare RAC contracts. For the new contract, CMS has continued to maintain the previously established ADR limits for institutional providers, originally established in January 2016, which reduced the ADR requirement to 0.5%. In April 2016, CMS instituted a new policy adjusting ADR limits based on provider denial rate after three (3) 45-day ADR cycles. This change significantly impacts the volumes of claims Medicare RACs are permitted to review for inpatient providers, and reduces their ability to identify overpayments and underpayments under their Medicare RAC contracts in the near term, pending the adjustment of ADR limits based on provider denial rates established following the first three (3) cycles of RAC reviews.\nFurther, in August 2014, CMS announced it would settle with hospitals willing to withdraw inpatient status claims currently pending in the RAC appeals process by offering to pay hospitals 68% for all eligible claims they had billed to Medicare. In June 2015, CMS notified HDI that based on the initial lists of finalized settlements, HDI owed CMS approximately $28.6 million due to adjustments in contingency fees under our existing Medicare RAC contract. HDI previously advised CMS that it disagrees with CMS\u2019 interpretation of the contract and that CMS does not have the contractual right, among other things, to require repayment of fees already paid. The amount ultimately payable to CMS by HDI remains uncertain. In addition, in September 2016, CMS announced that it would extend an opportunity for another round of settlements for hospitals that were eligible for but did not choose to participate in the 2014 settlement, with CMS offering to pay 66% for all eligible claims they had billed to Medicare. We believe this settlement will be processed and evaluated by CMS over the course of 2017, and the number and amount of claims that will be subject to the 2016 settlement remains uncertain. There could be a material negative impact on our future revenue to the extent that (i) any final determination of amounts owed by us to CMS under the current Medicare RAC contract materially exceeds our accrued reserves for such appeals, (ii) we are required to increase or decrease our contractually required reserves with respect to pending appeals due to changes in appeal performance, changes in data provided to us from other entities in the RAC process, or other related factors, (iii) we are required to repay a portion of prior fees associated with the hospital settlement program, (iv) we are unable to obtain full payments for properly provided services, or (v) future fees payable to us by CMS are reduced. Although we do not anticipate our Medicare RAC contract will represent a significant portion of our business going forward, our Medicare RAC contract still represents a future business opportunity for us and any of these factors or other changes to the Medicare RAC program that materially reduce our revenue or profitability with such program could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA failure to comply with the laws and regulations that apply to companies in our industry regarding individual privacy and information security could subject us to legal actions, fines and penalties and negatively impact our reputation and operations.\nAs a service provider, we often receive, process, transmit and store sensitive data, including PHI and personally identifiable information of individuals, as well as other financial, confidential and proprietary information belonging to our customers, subsidiaries, data supplies and other third parties from which we obtain information. The use and disclosure of that information is regulated at the federal, state, international and industry levels and we are also obligated by our contractual requirements with customers. For example, we are subject to federal regulation under HIPAA, as amended by the HITECH Act, the Final Omnibus Privacy, Security, Breach Notification, and Enforcement Rule, which modified and supplemented many of the standards and regulations under HIPAA and the HITECH Act, and various state laws. HIPAA also imposes standards and requirements on our business associates as defined under HIPAA.\nEven though we take measures to comply with all applicable regulations and to ensure our business associates and sub-contractors comply with these laws, regulations and rules, we have less than complete control over our business associates\u2019 and sub-contractors\u2019 actions and practices. We may be exposed to data breach risk if there is unauthorized access to one of our or our sub-contractors\u2019 secure facilities or from lost or stolen laptops, other portable media from current or former employee theft of data containing PHI, from misdirected mailings containing PHI, or other forms of administrative or operational error. If we or our sub-contractors fail to comply with applicable laws; if unauthorized parties gain physical access to one of our facilities and steals or misuses confidential information; if we erroneously use or disclose data in a way that is inconsistent with our granted rights; or if such information is misdirected, lost or stolen during transmission or transport, we may suffer damage to our reputation, potential loss of existing customers and difficulty attracting new customers. We could also be exposed to, among other things, unfavorable publicity, governmental inquiry and oversight, allegations by our customers that we have not performed our contractual obligations, costs to provide notifications to affected individuals, or litigation by affected parties and possible financial obligations for damages or indemnification obligations related to the theft or misuse of such information, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, laws, rules and regulations concerning the protection of personal information are subject to frequent change by legislation, regulatory issuances or administrative interpretation. As regulatory focus on privacy issues continues to increase and these laws and regulations continue to expand and become more complex, these potential risks to our business could intensify. Changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of certain types of sensitive data, such as healthcare data or other personally identifiable information, along with increased customer demands for enhanced data security infrastructure, could greatly increase our cost of providing our solutions and services.\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation, including government audits and investigations relating to our compliance with the laws and regulations applicable to companies in our industry, and a negative finding or other adverse determination could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMuch of our business is regulated by the federal government and the states in which we operate. The laws and regulations governing our operations are generally intended to benefit and protect individual citizens, including government program beneficiaries, health plan members and providers, rather than shareholders, and the government agencies administering these laws and regulations have broad latitude to enforce them. As such, we are subject, on an ongoing basis, to various governmental reviews, audits and investigations to verify our compliance with our contracts and applicable laws and regulations, as well as legal actions and enforcement proceedings. For example, because we receive payments from federal and state governmental agencies, we are subject to various laws, including the Federal Acquisition Regulations, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, federal and state employment, equal opportunity and affirmative action laws, federal and state prompt pay statutes. We are also subject to Federal False Claims Act and similar state statutes, which permit government law enforcement agencies to institute suits against us for violations and, in some cases, to seek double or treble damages, penalties and assessments. In addition, private citizens, acting as whistleblowers, can sue on behalf of the government under the \u201cqui tam\u201d provisions of the Federal False Claims Act and similar statutory provisions in many states.\nThe expansion of our operations into new solutions and services may further expose us to requirements and potential liabilities under additional statutes and legislative schemes that have previously not been relevant to our business, such as banking and credit reporting statutes, that may both increase demands on our resources for compliance activities and subject us to potential penalties for noncompliance with statutory and regulatory standards. Increased involvement in analytic or audit work that can have an impact on the eligibility of individuals for medical coverage or specific benefits, or payments made by our customers to providers, could increase the likelihood and incidence of our being subjected to scrutiny or legal actions by parties other than our customers, based on alleged mistakes or deficiencies in our work, with significant resulting costs and strain on our resources.\nThese laws and regulations, along with the terms of our government contracts, regulate how we do business, what solutions and services we offer and how we interact with our customers, providers, other healthcare payers and the public. If the government discovers improper or illegal activities in the course of audits or investigations, we may be subject to various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions and debarment from doing business with the government. Similarly, if our customers assert that we have failed to properly perform or comply with our contractual obligations, or if the carriers to which we send billings assert that we have failed to properly comply with applicable federal or state billing rules and regulations, we may be required to provide refunds or make payments to resolve such issues. The risks to which we are subject, particularly under the Federal False Claims Act and similar state fraud statutes, have also increased in recent years due to legislative changes that have (among other amendments) expanded the definition of a false claim to include, potentially, any unreimbursed overpayment received from, or other monetary debt owed to, a government agency. This subjects us to potential liability for a false claim, for example, where we may be overcharged for services by a sub-contractor and may pass that charge on to a government customer, or where we may have a good faith disagreement with a government agency\u2019s view of whether an overpayment has occurred. If we are found to be in violation of any applicable law or regulation, or if we receive an adverse review, audit or investigation, any resulting negative publicity, penalties or sanctions could have an adverse effect on our reputation in the industry, impair our ability to compete for new contracts or bid in response to RFPs in one or more jurisdictions and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFederal and state governments may limit or prohibit outsourcing of certain programs or functions, refuse to grant consents or waivers necessary to permit private entities to perform such work, or impose other limitations on outsourcing or certain vendors that may obstruct cost-effective performance of our contracts.\nThe federal government or a state could limit or prohibit private contractors like us from operating or performing elements of certain government functions or programs. State or local governments could be required to operate such programs with government employees as a condition of receiving federal funding. Moreover, under current law, in order to privatize certain functions of government programs, the federal government must grant a consent and/or waiver to the petitioning state or local agency. If the federal government does not grant a necessary consent or waiver, the state or local agency will be unable to outsource that function to a commercial entity. Such a situation could eliminate a contracting opportunity or reduce the value of an existing contract.\nSimilarly, other state or federal limitations on outsourcing certain types of work to vendors that supplement our own workforce could make it more difficult for us to fulfill our contracts in a cost-effective manner. Certain segments of our operations use or involve vendor or sub-contractor personnel located outside of the United States, who may (under carefully controlled circumstances) access certain PHI in the course of assisting us with various elements of the services we provide to our customers. There is, however, increasing pressure from an expanding number of sources to prohibit the use of off-shore labor, particularly on government contracts. The federal government and a number of states have considered laws or issued rules, regulations, and orders that would limit, restrict or wholly prohibit the use of off-shore labor in performance of government contracts, or impose sanctions for the use of such resources. Some of our customers have already chosen to contractually limit or restrict our ability to use off-shore resources. Intensified restrictions of this type or associated penalties could raise our costs of doing business, expose us to unexpected fines or penalties, increase the prices we must charge to customers to realize a profit and eliminate or significantly reduce the value of existing contracts or potential contract opportunities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be precluded from bidding on or performing certain work due to work we currently perform, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nVarious laws, regulations and administrative policies prohibit companies from performing work for government agencies in capacities that might be viewed to create an actual or perceived conflict of interest. In particular, CMS has stringent conflict of interest rules, which can limit our bidding for specific work for CMS, or for other contracts that might conflict, or be perceived by CMS to conflict, with contractual work for CMS. State governments and managed care organizations also have conflict of interest restrictions that could limit our ability to bid for certain work and impede our overall sales strategy. As we continue to expand and diversify our business operations, the likelihood that customers or potential customers will perceive conflicts of interest between our various subsidiaries, solutions, services, activities and customer relationships may increase. Such conflicts, whether real or perceived, could result in a loss of contracts or additional internal structural barriers that delay operational efficiency, or may require that we divest ourselves of certain existing businesses or reorganize our current management and personnel structure, as well as our corporate organization and entity structure, in order to qualify for new contract awards or to appropriately mitigate conflicts and otherwise accommodate the needs as a company that is expanding in complexity. Our failure to devote sufficient care, attention and resources to managing these adjustments may result in technical or administrative errors that could expose us to potential liability or adverse regulatory action. In addition, conflict of interest rules and standards change frequently, and are subject to varying interpretations and varying degrees and consistency of enforcement at the federal, state and municipal levels, and we may not be successful in navigating these restrictions. If we are prevented from expanding our business or are unable to effectively implement our strategic initiatives due to real or perceived conflicts of interest, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile, and fluctuations in the price of our common stock may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and materially adversely affect our shareholders.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated widely and may continue to do so. During the 52-week period ended May 31, 2017, the closing price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select market ranged from a high of $23.46 per share, to a low of $16.18 per share. Our stock price is subject to fluctuation as a result of a variety of factors, including factors beyond our control including the risk factors described above and those which are related to:\n\u00a7 changes in estimates of our performance or recommendations by securities analysts and operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to our company;\n\u00a7 news reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the healthcare industry, including perceptions in the marketplace regarding us and our competitors;\n\u00a7 the financial projections we publicly provide and any changes in or failure to meet those projections;\n\u00a7 future sales of shares of common stock in the public market by our executive officers or directors;\n\u00a7 any other changes in the amount of our outstanding shares, including as a result of share repurchases;\n\u00a7 the public\u2019s response to our press releases, or other public announcements, including our filings with the SEC;\n\u00a7 securities class actions, shareholder lawsuits or other litigation; and\n\u00a7 market conditions in the industry and the economy as a whole.\nIn addition, the stock market often experiences significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations are often unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock. When the market price of a company\u2019s stock drops significantly, shareholders may institute securities class action litigation against that company. Any litigation against us could cause us to incur substantial costs, divert the time and attention of our management and other resources or otherwise harm our business.\nBecause we do not intend to pay dividends, you will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value.\nWe have paid no cash dividends on any of our capital stock to date and currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, we do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The success of your investment in our common stock will likely depend entirely upon any future appreciation. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which you purchased your shares.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could discourage unsolicited takeover attempts, which could depress the market price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 5,000,000 shares of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock with such designations, rights and preferences as may be determined by our Board of Directors. Accordingly, our Board of Directors is empowered, without shareholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights, that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of holders of our common stock. In the event of issuance, preferred stock could be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method of discouraging, delaying, or preventing a change in control. Although we have no present intention to issue any shares of preferred stock, it is possible that we will do so in the future. In addition, our bylaws provide for a classified Board of Directors, require advance notice of shareholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of our shareholders and for nominations of candidates for election to our Board of Directors and provide for Delaware as an exclusive forum for certain disputes with our shareholders, all of which could also have the effect of discouraging a change of control.", "PERMNO": 78156, "SIC": 6411, "TIC": "HMSY"}
