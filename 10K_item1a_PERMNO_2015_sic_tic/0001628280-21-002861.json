RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves significant risks. Before investing, carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. The risks and uncertainties described below are the ones we believe may materially affect us. Many of them have been or may become exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. There may be others of which we are unaware that could materially harm our business or financial condition and cause the price of our stock to decline, in which case you could lose all or part of your investment.\nSummary of Principal Risks\nThe following bullet points summarize the principal risks we face, each of which could adversely affect our business, operations, and financial results. For clarity of presentation, we have arranged these risks by the part of our business they most directly affect - (i) commercial operations, (ii) research and development, (iii) capital need and financial results, (iv) intellectual property and (v) our stock price. A sixth group of \u201cgeneral risks\u201d lists risks that affect our business as a whole.\nRisks Related to our Commercial Activities\n\u2022Failure to generate sufficient revenue from the sale of Korlym would harm our financial results and would likely cause our stock price to decline.\n\u2022The COVID-19 pandemic or other public health emergencies, natural disasters, terrorism or other catastrophes could disrupt our activities and render our own or our vendors\u2019 facilities and equipment inoperable or inaccessible and require us to curtail or cease operations.\n\u2022If generic versions of Korlym are approved and successfully commercialized, our business, results of operations and financial position would be adversely affected.\n\u2022Other companies offer or are attempting to develop different medications to treat patients with Cushing\u2019s syndrome. The availability of competing treatments could limit our revenue from Korlym.\n\u2022If we cannot continue to obtain acceptable prices or adequate insurance coverage and reimbursement for Korlym, we will be unable to generate significant revenues.\n\u2022We depend on vendors to manufacture Korlym\u2019s active ingredient, form it into tablets, package it and dispense it to patients. We also depend on vendors to manufacture the API and capsules or tablets for our product candidates. If our suppliers become unable or unwilling to perform these functions and we cannot transfer these activities to replacement vendors in a timely manner, our business will be harmed.\nRisks Related to our Research and Development Activities\n\u2022Clinical drug development is lengthy, expensive and often unsuccessful. Results of early studies and trials are often not predictive of later trial results. Failure can occur at any stage of drug development. Our efforts to discover, develop and commercialize our product candidates may not succeed.\n\u2022The COVID-19 pandemic has made initiating and advancing our clinical development programs more difficult.\n\u2022Vendors manufacture and distribute the drug product we use in our trials, conduct and manage some of our clinical trials and perform data collection and analysis. Failure of these vendors to perform their duties or meet expected timelines may prevent or delay approval of our product candidates.\n\u2022Our products and product candidates may cause undesirable side effects that halt their clinical development, prevent their regulatory approval, limit their commercial potential or cause us significant liability.\nRisks Related to our Capital Needs and Financial Results\n\u2022We may need additional capital to fund our operations or for strategic reasons. Such capital may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nRisks Relating to Our Intellectual Property\n\u2022To succeed, we must secure and maintain adequate patent protection for the composition and methods of use of our proprietary, selective cortisol modulators and for the use of Korlym to treat Cushing\u2019s syndrome and other disorders.\n\u2022Third parties may allege that our patents infringe their rights. Defending against such allegations may result in costly litigation and may require us to obtain a license or bar us from commercializing our product candidates or Korlym for a new indication.\nRisks Related to Our Stock\n\u2022The price of our common stock fluctuates widely and is likely to continue to do so. Opportunities for the sale of shares at any particular time may be limited.\n\u2022Our stock price may decline if our financial performance does not meet the guidance we have provided to the public, estimates published by research analysts or other investor expectations.\nGeneral Risks\n\u2022We are subject to government regulation and other legal obligations relating to privacy and data protection. Compliance with these requirements is complex and costly. Failure to comply could materially harm our business.\n\u2022We may be unable to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals for our product or product candidates.\n\u2022Anti-takeover provisions in our charter and bylaws and under Delaware law may make an acquisition of us or a change in our management more expensive or difficult, even if an acquisition or a management change would be beneficial to our stockholders.\n\u2022We rely heavily on information technology systems to conduct our business. A breakdown or breach of these systems or our failure to protect confidential information concerning our business, patients or employees could interrupt the operation of our business and subject us to liability.\n\u2022Our officers, directors and principal stockholders, acting as a group, could significantly influence corporate actions.\nRisk Factors - Discussion\nThe following section discusses the principal risks listed above, as well as other risks we believe to be material.\nRisks Related to our Commercial Activities\nFailure to generate sufficient revenue from the sale of Korlym would harm our financial results and would likely cause our stock price to decline.\nOur ability to generate revenue and to fund our commercial operations and development programs is dependent on the sale of Korlym to treat patients with Cushing\u2019s syndrome. Physicians will prescribe Korlym only if they determine that it is preferable to other treatments, even if those treatments are not approved for Cushing\u2019s syndrome. Because Cushing\u2019s syndrome is rare, most physicians are inexperienced diagnosing or caring for patients with the illness and it can be hard to persuade them to identify appropriate patients and treat them with Korlym.\nMany factors could limit our Korlym revenue, including:\n\u2022the preference of some physicians for off-label treatments for Cushing\u2019s syndrome, such as ketoconazole;\n\u2022competition from non-medical treatments, such as surgery and radiation;\n\u2022natural disasters or other catastrophes, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, that reduce the ability or willingness of physicians to see patients or of patients to bear the risk of leaving their homes to seek medical care;\n\u2022the introduction of competing treatments, including generic versions of Korlym;\n\u2022lack of availability of government or private insurance, which may be exacerbated if (i) the U.S. Supreme Court strikes down the Affordable Care Act, which greatly increased the number of Americans with health insurance or (ii) significant increases in unemployment cause patients to lose employer-provided private health insurance and either shift to Medicaid, which reimburses Korlym at a significantly lower price, or become uninsured, which would decrease our revenue and increase the burden on our financial assistance and free drug programs and on the independent charities we support; and\n\u2022negative publicity and political concerns about Korlym\u2019s active ingredient, mifepristone, which is approved in another drug for the termination of pregnancy\nFailure to generate sufficient Korlym revenue could prevent us from fully funding our planned commercial and clinical activities and would likely cause our stock price to decline.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic or other public health emergencies, natural disasters, terrorism or other catastrophes could disrupt our activities and render our own or our vendors\u2019 facilities and equipment inoperable or inaccessible and require us to curtail or cease operations.\nCOVID-19, a serious and sometimes fatal illness, has spread to every country in the world and throughout the United States. Many countries, including most states of the United States, have reacted by instituting quarantines, \u201clockdowns\u201d and other public health restrictions on leisure activities, work and travel. In California, where our headquarters are located, and in the states where our clinical specialists and medical science liaisons live and work, residents are subject to significant public health restrictions. Attempts by some states to lift these restrictions have led to a sharp increase in the number of new COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations and deaths, which in turn has led to the reimposition of restrictions, as well as to voluntary reductions in public activities by residents concerned for their health. Although many jurisdictions consider pharmaceutical companies as \u201cessential businesses\u201d with wide freedom to operate, we have been managing our business primarily by video conference, teleconference and email. We rely on third-party manufacturers, distributors (including the specialty pharmacy that dispenses Korlym), information technology and software service providers, law and accounting firms, clinical research organizations and consultants who are subject to, or may become subject to, pandemic-related controls. If these third parties cannot perform the services we require in a timely way and we cannot successfully implement replacements or workarounds, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.\nCOVID-19 has made it more difficult to interact with physicians who treat patients with Cushing\u2019s syndrome. Steps physicians have taken to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection in their practices include reducing the frequency of patient office visits and barring office visits by third parties, including our clinical specialists and medical science liaisons. Pandemic-related closures of clinical laboratories and imaging centers, as well as the reluctance of patients to leave the safety of their homes, has made it difficult for many physicians to identify patients who may benefit from Korlym, begin their treatment, titrate to an optimum dose and maintain their regimen, which has reduced our revenue. If physicians do not prescribe Korlym to new patients or have difficulty increasing a patient\u2019s Korlym dose to its optimal level, or if patients already receiving Korlym discontinue treatment, our revenue will be unlikely to grow and may decline further.\nOther natural or man-made disasters could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. Our headquarters are in the San Francisco Bay Area, which experiences earthquakes. Our specialty pharmacy, tablet manufacturers and warehouses are in areas subject to hurricanes and tornadoes. Political considerations relating to mifepristone put us and our manufacturers at increased risk of protests and disruptive events. If a disaster were to occur, we might not be able to operate our business. Our insurance, if available at all, would likely be insufficient to cover losses resulting from disasters or other business interruptions.\nIf generic versions of Korlym are approved and successfully commercialized, our business, results of operations and financial position would be adversely affected.\nThe marketing exclusivity provided by Korlym\u2019s orphan drug designation expired in February 2019, which means other companies may now seek to introduce generic equivalents of Korlym for the treatment of Cushing\u2019s syndrome, provided they receive FDA approval and can show that they would not infringe our applicable patents or that those patents are invalid or unenforceable. If our patents are successfully challenged and a generic version of Korlym becomes available, our sales of Korlym tablets and their price could decline rapidly and significantly, which would reduce our revenue and materially harm our results of operations and financial position. Competition from a generic version of Korlym may also cause our revenue to be materially less than the public guidance we have provided, which would likely cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nWe have sued Teva and Sun in Federal District Court with respect to their proposed generic versions of Korlym. In addition, Teva has challenged the validity of one of our patents in a proceeding before the Patent Trial and Appeals Board. Legal action to enforce or defend intellectual property rights is complex, costly and involves significant commitments of management time. There can be no assurance of a successful outcome. Please see \u201cPart I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings.\u201d Furthermore, the 30-month stay provided by the Hatch-Waxman Act expired on August 2, 2020, which means Teva now has final approval from the FDA to market its generic version of Korlym and may choose to do so at any time, notwithstanding any ongoing litigation or administrative disputes with us. Even if we prevail in our legal actions and Teva withdraws its product and pays us damages, the temporary availability of a generic version of Korlym would materially harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nOn February 1, 2021, we received a Paragraph IV notice from Hikma stating that is seeking FDA approval to market a generic version of Korlym. It is likely that other companies will do the same. While we will vigorously protect our intellectual property, there can be no assurance our efforts will be successful.\nOther companies offer or are attempting to develop different medications to treat patients with Cushing\u2019s syndrome. The availability of competing treatments could limit our revenue from Korlym.\nSince 2012, a medication owned by the Italian pharmaceutical company Recordati-S.p.A., the somatostatin analogue Signifor\u00ae (pasireotide) Injection, has been marketed in both the United States and the EU for adult patients with Cushing\u2019s disease (a subset of Cushing\u2019s syndrome). On March 6, 2020, the FDA granted Recordati approval to market another cortisol synthesis inhibitor, Isturisa\u00ae (osilodrostat) tablets, to treat patients with Cushing\u2019s disease. Osilodrostat is approved in the EU for the treatment of patients with Cushing\u2019s syndrome. Osilodrostat has been designated an orphan drug in both the EU and the United States.\nStrongbridge Biopharma plc (\u201cStrongbridge\u201d) has received orphan drug designation in the United States and the EU for the use of the cortisol synthesis inhibitor levoketoconazole to treat patients with Cushing\u2019s syndrome. Levoketoconazole is an enantiomer of the generic anti-fungal medication, ketoconazole, that is prescribed off-label to treat patients with Cushing\u2019s syndrome. Strongbridge has completed two Phase 3 trials, which met their primary endpoints of reducing cortisol synthesis, and expects to submit a new drug application (\u201cNDA\u201d) to the FDA in the first quarter of 2021.\nIf we cannot continue to obtain acceptable prices or adequate insurance coverage and reimbursement for Korlym, we will be unable to generate significant revenues.\nThe commercial success of Korlym depends on the availability of adequate insurance coverage and reimbursement. Government payers, including Medicare, Medicaid and the Veterans Administration, as well as private insurers and health maintenance organizations, are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting reimbursement for medicines. If government or private payers cease to provide adequate and timely coverage and reimbursement for Korlym, physicians may not prescribe the medication and patients may not purchase it, even if it is prescribed. In addition, delays in coverage for individual patients may reduce our revenues.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global economic contraction that may last a long time. Significant increases in unemployment stemming from the pandemic may cause some patients to lose their employer-sponsored insurance and may increase patient reliance on Medicaid (which pays significantly less for Korlym) and our financial assistance and free drug\nprograms and on the independent charities we support. There may also be delays in coverage as patients secure authorization for Korlym treatment from a new insurer. If the pandemic causes any of these effects, our revenue would decline and our charitable donation expense would increase.\nIn many foreign markets, drug prices and the profitability of prescription medications are subject to government control. In the United States, we expect that there will continue to be federal and state proposals for similar controls. Also, the trends toward managed health care in the United States and recent laws and legislation intended to increase the public visibility of drug prices and reduce the cost of government and private insurance programs could significantly influence the purchase of health care services and products and may result in lower prices for Korlym.\nIn the United States, there have been and continue to be a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ACA, which was passed in 2010, substantially changed the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers. The ACA, among other things, expanded Medicaid program eligibility and access to commercial health insurance coverage, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, established annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, and promoted a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program. The ACA also appropriated funding to comparative clinical effectiveness research, although it remains unclear how the research will affect Medicare coverage and reimbursement or how new information will influence other third-party payer policies.\nSince its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts (the \u201cTax Act\u201d) was enacted, which, among other things, removed penalties for not complying with the individual mandate to carry health insurance. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. On December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court\u2019s decision that the individual mandate was unconstitutional but remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are invalid as well. On March 2, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court granted the petitions for writs of certiorari to review the case, although it is unclear when the decision will be made or how these decisions, subsequent appeals, if any, and the Supreme Court will rule. In addition, there may be other efforts to challenge, replace or repeal the ACA that may affect the law or our business. Any new limitations on, changes to, or uncertainty with respect to the ability of individuals to enroll in governmental reimbursement programs or other third-party payer insurance plans could reduce Korlym sales, which in turn could affect our ability to successfully develop and commercialize new products.\nOther legislative and regulatory changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. These changes included an aggregate reduction in Medicare payments to providers of 2 percent per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021, unless additional Congressional action is taken. In addition, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Moreover, the federal government and the individual states in the United States have become increasingly active in developing proposals, passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control drug pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, formulary flexibility, marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures.\nThese new laws and the regulations and policies implementing them, as well as other healthcare-related measures that may be adopted in the future, could materially reduce our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates.\nThe unfavorable public perception of mifepristone may limit our ability to sell Korlym.\nThe active ingredient in Korlym, mifepristone, is approved by the FDA in another drug for the termination of early pregnancy. As a result, mifepristone is the subject of considerable debate in the United States and elsewhere. Public perception of mifepristone may limit the acceptance of Korlym by patients and physicians. Even though we have taken measures to minimize the chance that Korlym will accidentally be prescribed to a pregnant woman, physicians may choose not to prescribe Korlym to a woman simply to avoid the risk of terminating a pregnancy.\nWe depend on vendors to manufacture Korlym\u2019s active ingredient, form it into tablets, package it and dispense it to patients. We also depend on vendors to manufacture the API and capsules or tablets for our product candidates. If our suppliers become unable or unwilling to perform these functions and we cannot transfer these activities to replacement vendors in a timely manner, our business will be harmed.\nA single third-party manufacturer, PCAS, supplies the API in Korlym. Two other third-party manufacturers produce and bottle Korlym tablets. Our agreement with PCAS automatically renews for two one-year terms, unless either party provides 12-months\u2019 written notice of its intent not to renew. A single specialty pharmacy, Optime Care, Inc. (\u201cOptime\u201d) dispenses Korlym directly to patients and collects payments from insurers representing approximately 99 percent of our revenue. If Optime does not adhere to its agreements with payers, it may not be able to collect some or all of the payments due to us. Our agreement with Optime has a five-year term and renews upon the written consent of both parties, subject to customary termination provisions, including the right of Optime to terminate in the event of a material breach by us that we do not cure in a reasonable period of time after receiving written notice. In addition, we may terminate the agreement for convenience. In the event any of these vendors fails to perform its contractual obligations to us or is materially impaired in its performance by the COVID-19 pandemic or for any other reason, we may experience disruptions and delays in our supply chain and our ability to deliver Korlym to patients, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position.\nThe facilities used by our vendors to manufacture and package the API and drug product for Korlym and our product candidates must be approved by the FDA and, in some cases, the European Medicines Agency (\u201cEMA\u201d). We do not control the activities of these vendors, including whether they maintain adequate quality control and hire qualified personnel. We are dependent on them for compliance with the regulatory requirements known as current good manufacturing practices (\u201ccGMPs\u201d). If our vendors cannot manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict requirements of the FDA or others, they will not be able to maintain regulatory authorizations for their facilities and we could be prohibited from using the API or drug product they have provided. If the FDA, EMA or other regulatory authorities withdraw regulatory authorizations of these facilities, we may need to find alternative vendors or facilities, which would be time-consuming, complex and expensive and could significantly hamper our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for and market our products. Sanctions could be imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, refusal of regulators to approve our product candidates, delays, suspensions or withdrawals of approvals, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could harm our business.\nWe may not have adequate insurance to cover our exposure to product liability claims.\nWe may be subject to product liability or other claims based on allegations that Korlym or one of our product candidates has harmed a patient. Such a claim may damage our reputation by raising questions about Korlym or our product candidates\u2019 safety and could prevent or interfere with product development or commercialization. Less common adverse effects of a pharmaceutical product are sometimes not known until long after the product is approved for marketing. Because the active ingredient in Korlym is used to terminate pregnancy, clinicians using Korlym in clinical trials and physicians prescribing the medicine to women must take strict precautions to ensure that it is not administered to pregnant women. Failure to observe these precautions could result in significant product liability claims.\nOur insurance may not fully cover our potential product liabilities. Inability to obtain adequate insurance coverage could inhibit development of our product candidates or result in significant uninsured liability. Defending a lawsuit could be costly and divert management from productive activities.\nIf we are unable to maintain regulatory approval of Korlym for the treatment of patients with Cushing\u2019s syndrome or if we fail to comply with other requirements, we will be unable to generate revenue and may be subject to penalties.\nWe are subject to oversight by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States and elsewhere with respect to our research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and sales and marketing activities. These requirements include submissions of safety information, annual updates on manufacturing activities and continued compliance with FDA regulations, including cGMPs, good laboratory practices and good clinical practices (\u201cGCP\u201d). The FDA enforces these regulations through inspections of us and the laboratories, manufacturers and clinical sites we use. Foreign regulatory authorities have comparable requirements and enforcement mechanisms. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or product candidate, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency or deficiencies in manufacturing processes or management, as well as failure to comply with FDA or other U.S. or foreign regulatory requirements, may subject us to substantial civil and criminal penalties, injunctions, holds on clinical trials, product seizure, refusal to permit the import or export of products, restrictions on product marketing, withdrawal of the product from the market, product recalls, total or partial suspension of production, refusal to approve pending NDAs or supplemental NDAs, and suspension or revocation of product approvals.\nWe may be subject to civil or criminal penalties if our marketing of Korlym violates FDA regulations or health care fraud and abuse laws.\nWe are subject to FDA regulations governing the promotion and sale of medications. Although physicians are permitted to prescribe drugs for any indication they choose, manufacturers may only promote products for their FDA-approved use. All other uses are referred to as \u201coff-label.\u201d In the United States, we market Korlym to treat hyperglycemia secondary to hypercortisolism in adult patients with endogenous Cushing\u2019s syndrome who have type 2 diabetes mellitus or glucose intolerance and for whom surgery has failed or is not an option. We provide promotional materials and training programs to physicians covering the use of Korlym for this indication. The FDA may change its policies or enact new regulations at any time that restrict our ability to promote our products.\nIf the FDA were to determine that we engaged in off-label promotion, the FDA could require us to change our practices and subject us to regulatory enforcement actions, including issuance of a public \u201cwarning letter,\u201d injunction, seizure, civil fine or criminal penalties. Other federal or state enforcement authorities might act if they believe that the alleged improper promotion led to the submission and payment of claims for an unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement. Even if it is determined that we are not in violation of these laws, we may receive negative publicity, incur significant expenses and be forced to devote management time to defending our position.\nIn addition to laws restricting off-label promotion, we are also subject to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations designed to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing, and other abusive practices. The U.S. healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;\n\u2022federal false claims laws, including, without limitation, the False Claims Act, which prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act. Pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under these laws for a variety of promotional and marketing activities, such as allegedly providing free product to or entering into \u201csham\u201d consulting arrangements with customers to induce such customers to purchase, order or recommend the company\u2019s products in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute and federal false claims laws and regulations; reporting to pricing services inflated average wholesale prices that were then used by certain governmental programs to set reimbursement rates; engaging in the promotion of \u201coff-label\u201d uses that caused customers to submit claims to and obtain reimbursement from governmental payers for non-covered \u201coff-label\u201d uses; and submitting inflated best price information to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; the government may assert that a claim including items and services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act;\n\u2022the federal Civil Monetary Penalties law, which prohibits, among other things, offering or transferring remuneration to a federal healthcare beneficiary that a person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary\u2019s decision to order or receive items or services reimbursable by the government from a particular provider or supplier;\n\u2022the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), which created federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program or making false statements relating to health care matters; similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;\n\u2022federal \u201csunshine\u201d laws, including the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, that require transparency regarding financial arrangements with health care providers, such as the reporting and disclosure requirements imposed by the ACA on drug manufacturers regarding any \u201ctransfer of value\u201d made or distributed to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain health care professionals beginning in 2022, teaching hospitals, and ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Manufacturers are required to submit reports detailing these financial arrangements by the 90th day of each calendar year;\n\u2022federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers; and\n\u2022state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; and state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and pricing information.\nThe risk of being found in violation of these laws and regulations is increased by the fact that many of them have not been definitively interpreted by regulatory authorities or the courts and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available under them, it is possible that some of our business activities, including our relationships with physicians and other healthcare providers (some of whom recommend, purchase and/or prescribe our products) and the manner in which we promote our products, could be subject to challenge. We are also exposed to the risk that our employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, vendors, distributors, and contract research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d) may engage in fraudulent or other illegal activity. Although we have policies and procedures prohibiting such activity, it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct and the precautions we take may not be effective in controlling unknown risks or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations.\nIf we violate any of the laws described above or any other government regulations, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from governmental health care programs, a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance, individual imprisonment, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our financial results and ability to operate.\nRisks Related to our Research and Development Activities\nClinical drug development is lengthy, expensive and often unsuccessful. Results of early studies and trials are often not predictive of later trial results. Failure can occur at any stage of drug development. Our efforts to discover, develop and commercialize our product candidates may not succeed.\nClinical development is expensive, lengthy and often unsuccessful. Data from clinical trials are susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The results from early clinical trials are often not predictive of results in later clinical trials. Product candidates may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having produced positive results in preclinical studies and initial clinical trials. Many companies have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or unanticipated or unexpectedly severe adverse events.\nOur current clinical trials may prove inadequate to support marketing approvals. Even trials that generate positive results may have to be confirmed in much larger, more expensive and lengthier trials before we could realistically seek regulatory approval of a product candidate.\nClinical trials may be delayed by many factors, including:\n\u2022slow patient enrollment or delayed activation of clinical trial sites due to the COVID-19 pandemic or other factors;\n\u2022delays obtaining regulatory permission to start a trial, changes to the size or design of a trial or changes in regulatory requirements for a trial already underway;\n\u2022inability to secure acceptable terms with vendors and an appropriate number of clinical trial sites;\n\u2022delays or inability to obtain institutional review board (\u201cIRB\u201d) approval at prospective trial sites;\n\u2022failure of patients or investigators to comply with the clinical trial protocol;\n\u2022unforeseen safety issues; and\n\u2022negative findings of inspections of clinical sites or manufacturing operations by us, the FDA or other authorities.\nA trial may also be suspended or terminated by us, the trial\u2019s data safety monitoring board, the IRBs governing the sites where the trial is being conducted or the FDA for many reasons, including failure to comply with regulatory requirements or\nclinical protocols, negative findings in an inspection of our clinical trial operations or trial sites by the FDA or other authorities, unforeseen safety issues, failure to demonstrate a benefit or changes in government regulations. Disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic increase the likelihood of delays in initiating or completing our planned and ongoing clinical trials. Please see the risk factor, \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic has made conducting our clinical development programs more difficult.\u201d\nDuring the development of a product candidate, we may decide, or the FDA or other regulatory authorities may require us, to conduct more pre-clinical or clinical studies or to change the size or design of a trial already underway, which could delay or prevent the completion of development and increase its cost. Even if we conduct all of the clinical trials and supportive studies that we consider appropriate and the results are positive, we may not receive regulatory approval.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has made initiating and advancing our clinical development programs more difficult.\nWe conduct clinical trials at sites in the United States, Canada, Europe and Israel. In all of these places, authorities have imposed significant public health restrictions of varying degrees of severity which are likely to persist until a COVID-19 vaccine or effective treatment is widely available. In addition, physicians, patients and medical institutions have changed their behavior in an attempt to reduce the risk of infection that makes clinical trials more expensive, time-consuming and risky to initiate and conduct.\nSome of the sites where we are conducting clinical trials have stopped enrolling new patients or reduced the frequency with which enrolled patients see their physicians. Some clinical sites have temporarily stopped initiating new trials. Many patients are reluctant to participate in procedures required by our clinical trial protocols because they fear infection. In general, COVID-19 has slowed the pace of our clinical trials, including our studies in Cushing\u2019s syndrome, AIWG and NASH. Studies of diseases perceived to be acutely life-threatening, such as advanced solid tumors, have been experienced less delay and disruption.\nIf COVID-19 remains prevalent, we may experience additional disruptions, which could have a material adverse impact on our clinical trial plans and timelines, including:\n\u2022delays in enrolling patients in our clinical trials;\n\u2022delays in clinical site initiation, including difficulties in recruiting clinical investigators and staff;\n\u2022delays in receiving authorizations from local regulatory authorities and internal review boards to initiate clinical trials or amend existing protocols;\n\u2022delays in clinical sites receiving necessary supplies and materials due to interruptions in local and global shipping;\n\u2022changes in local regulations that require us to change the ways in which our clinical trials are conducted, which may result in unexpected costs or cause us to suspend or discontinue a trial in the affected jurisdiction;\n\u2022diversion of healthcare resources, including facilities, supplies and staff, away from the conduct of clinical trials;\n\u2022interruption of key clinical trial activities, such as clinical trial site monitoring, patient visits and follow-up, study procedures and data collection, that could affect the integrity of clinical trial data, due to limitations on travel;\n\u2022the infection of patients enrolled in our clinical trials with COVID-19, which could affect the results of the clinical trial, including by increasing the number of observed adverse events or by causing patients to drop out of the study;\n\u2022patient discontinuations due to fear of infection with COVID-19;\n\u2022interruptions or delays in preclinical studies due to restricted or limited operations at laboratory facilities;\n\u2022delays in necessary interactions with local regulators, ethics committees and other third parties and contractors due to limitations in employee resources or the furlough of government employees;\n\u2022limitations caused by the sickness of our employees or their families or the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people; and\n\u2022the possible refusal of the FDA or other regulatory authorities to accept data from clinical trials in affected geographies.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic affects our business, preclinical studies and clinical trials will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence.\nVendors manufacture and distribute the drug product we use in our trials, conduct and manage some of our clinical trials and perform data collection and analysis. Failure of these vendors to perform their duties or meet expected timelines may prevent or delay approval of our product candidates.\nThird-party clinical investigators and clinical sites enroll patients and CROs manage many of our trials and perform data collection and analysis. Although we control only certain aspects of these third-parties\u2019 activities, we are responsible for ensuring that every study adheres to its protocol and meets regulatory and scientific standards. If any of our vendors does not perform its duties or meet expected deadlines or fails to adhere to applicable GCP, or if the quality or accuracy of the data it produces is compromised, affected clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may be unable to obtain approval for our product candidates. Failure of our manufacturing vendors to perform their duties or comply with cGMPs may require us to recall drug product or repeat clinical trials, which would delay regulatory approval. If our agreements with any of these vendors terminate, we may not be able to enter into alternative arrangements in a timely manner or on reasonable terms.\nOur ability to physically inspect our vendors and clinical sites has been limited by the COVID-19 pandemic and associated public health restrictions, which increases the risk that failures to meet applicable requirements will go undetected.\nObtaining regulatory approval of product candidates in foreign jurisdictions would be costly and difficult. Failure to obtain such approvals would prevent us from commercializing our product candidates outside the United States.\nWe may seek to commercialize our products in international markets, which would require us to receive a marketing authorization and, in many cases, pricing approval, from the appropriate regulatory authorities. These approval processes include all of the risks associated with the FDA\u2019s approval process and, in some cases, more. Approval procedures vary between countries and can require additional pre-clinical or clinical studies. Obtaining approval may take longer than it does in the United States. Although approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by others, failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory process in others.\nOur products and product candidates may cause undesirable side effects that halt their clinical development, prevent their regulatory approval, limit their commercial potential or cause us significant liability.\nPatients in clinical trials report changes in their health, including new illnesses, injuries, and discomforts, to their study doctor. Often, it is not possible to determine whether or not these conditions were caused by the drug candidate being studied or something else. As we test our product candidates in larger, longer and more extensive clinical trials, or as use of them becomes more widespread if we receive regulatory approval, patients may report serious adverse events that did not occur or went undetected in previous trials. Many times, serious side effects are only detected in large-scale, Phase 3 clinical trials or following commercial approval.\nAdverse events reported in clinical trials can slow or stop patient recruitment, prevent enrolled patients from completing a trial and could give rise to liability claims. Regulatory authorities could respond to reported adverse events by interrupting or halting our clinical trials or limiting the scope of, delaying or denying marketing approval. If we elect, or are required by authorities, to delay, suspend or terminate any clinical trial or commercialization efforts, the commercial prospects of such product candidates or products may be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenues from them may be delayed or eliminated.\nIf one of our product candidates receives marketing approval, and we or others later identify undesirable side effects or adverse events, potentially significant negative consequences could result, including but not limited to:\n\u2022regulatory authorities may suspend, limit or withdraw approvals of such product;\n\u2022regulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label, including \u201cboxed\u201d warnings, or issue safety alerts and other safety information about the product;\n\u2022we may be required to change the way the product is administered or conduct additional studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022we may be required to create a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), which could include a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients, a communication plan for healthcare providers and/or other elements to assure safe use;\n\u2022the product may become less competitive;\n\u2022we may be subject to fines, injunctions or the imposition of criminal penalties; and\n\u2022we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients;\nAny of these events could seriously harm our business.\nWe need to increase the size of our organization and may experience difficulties in managing growth.\nOur commercial and research and development efforts are constrained by our limited administrative, operational and management resources. To date, we have relied on a small management team. Growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to recruit and retain additional employees. Our financial performance and ability to compete will depend on our ability to manage growth effectively. To that end, we must:\n\u2022manage our sales and marketing efforts, clinical trials, research and manufacturing activities effectively;\n\u2022hire more management, clinical development, administrative and sales and marketing personnel; and\n\u2022continue to develop our administrative systems and controls.\nFailure to accomplish any of these tasks, which will be more difficult during the COVID-19 pandemic, could harm our business.\nIf we lose key personnel or are unable to attract more skilled personnel, we may be unable to pursue our product development and commercialization goals.\nOur ability to operate successfully and manage growth depends upon hiring and retaining skilled managerial, scientific, sales, marketing, and financial personnel. The job market for qualified personnel is intensely competitive. We depend on the principal members of our management and scientific staff. Any officer or employee may terminate his or her relationship with us at any time and work for a competitor. We do not have employment insurance covering any of our personnel. The loss of key individuals could delay our research, development and commercialization efforts.\nRisks Related to our Capital Needs and Financial Results\nWe may need additional capital to fund our operations or for strategic reasons. Such capital may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe are dependent on revenue from the sale of Korlym and our cash reserves to fund our commercial operations and development programs. If Korlym revenue declines significantly, we may need to curtail our operations or raise funds to support our plans. We may also choose to raise funds for strategic reasons. We cannot be certain funding will be available on acceptable terms or at all. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased volatility and may reduce liquidity in the equity markets, which would make raising additional capital more difficult and expensive. Equity financing would cause dilution, debt financing may involve restrictive covenants. Neither type of financing may be available to us on attractive terms or at all. If we obtain funds through collaborations with other companies, we may have to relinquish rights to one or more of our product candidates. If our revenue declines and our cash reserves are depleted, and if adequate funds are not available from other sources, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of our development programs.\nIf we are unable to obtain or maintain orphan designation for our product candidates our financial results may be negatively affected.\nIn the United States and the EU, orphan drug designation confers financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages, and reduction of fees or fee waivers. Although we have received orphan drug designation for relacorilant for the treatment of patients with Cushing\u2019s syndrome and patients with pancreatic cancer in both the United States and EU, we may be unable to maintain these designations or to obtain designations for our other product candidates, which may negatively affect our financial results.\nRisks Relating to Our Intellectual Property\nTo succeed, we must secure and maintain adequate patent protection for the composition and methods of use of our proprietary, selective cortisol modulators and for the use of Korlym to treat Cushing\u2019s syndrome and other disorders.\nPatents are uncertain, involve complex legal and factual questions and are frequently the subject of litigation. The patents issued or licensed to us may be challenged at any time. Competitors may take actions we believe infringe our intellectual property, causing us to take legal action to defend our rights. Intellectual property litigation is lengthy, expensive and requires significant management attention. Outcomes are uncertain. If we do not protect our intellectual property, competitors may erode our competitive advantage. Please see \u201cPart I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings.\u201d\nOur patent applications may not result in issued patents and patents issued to us may be challenged, invalidated, held unenforceable or circumvented. Our patents may not prevent third parties from producing competing products. The foreign countries where we may someday operate may not protect our intellectual property to the extent the laws of the United States do. If we fail to obtain adequate patent protection in other countries, others may produce products in those countries based on our technology.\nThird parties may allege that our patents infringe their rights. Defending against such allegations may result in costly litigation and may require us to obtain a license or bar us from commercializing our product candidates or Korlym for a new indication.\nOur development and commercialization of Korlym or our selective cortisol modulators may give rise to claims that our patents or the patents we have licensed infringe the rights of others, which may require us to engage in costly, time-consuming and possibly unsuccessful litigation. If it is determined that one of our products or product candidates infringe others\u2019 patent rights, we may have to obtain licenses to those rights or delay or suspend commercial activity while we attempt to design around the infringed patent. If our efforts fail, we may be unable to commercialize the infringing product or product candidate. We do not have liability insurance for patent infringement.\nWe do not believe that we infringe any patents or other proprietary rights. We are not obligated to pay royalties relating to the use of intellectual property except to the University of Chicago. To maintain our licenses from the University of Chicago, we must make milestone and royalty payments. If we do not comply with our obligations under these licenses, we may lose the right to commercialize cortisol modulators, including mifepristone, for the treatment of TNBC and CRPC.\nOur patents concerning mifepristone cover its use, not its composition, which may make it harder to prevent patent infringement.\nWe own or have exclusively licensed issued U.S. patents covering the use of cortisol modulators, including mifepristone, to treat a variety of disorders. A method of use patent covers only a particular use of a compound, not its composition. Because our patents do not cover the composition of mifepristone, we cannot prevent others from commercializing mifepristone to treat disorders not covered by our method of use patents. The availability of mifepristone for these disorders may enable patients to obtain mifepristone from other companies for indications covered by our patents. Although such \u201coff-label\u201d use would violate our patents, effectively monitoring compliance and enforcing our rights may be difficult and costly. Mifepristone is sold in the United States by Danco Laboratories for the termination of pregnancy. We cannot be certain that patients with Cushing\u2019s syndrome will not be able to obtain mifepristone from Danco or another company, should that company receive approval to market mifepristone for any indication.\nRisks Related to Our Stock\nThe price of our common stock fluctuates widely and is likely to continue to do so. Opportunities for the sale of shares at any particular time may be limited.\nWe cannot assure investors that a liquid trading market for our common stock will exist at any particular time. As a result, holders of our common stock may not be able to sell shares quickly or at the current market price. During the 52-week period ended February 17, 2021, our average daily trading volume was approximately 1,466,131 shares and the intra-day sales prices per share of our common stock on The Nasdaq Stock Market ranged from $9.70 to $31.18. As of February 17, 2021, our officers, directors and principal stockholders beneficially owned approximately 16 percent of our common stock.\nOur stock price can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance or prospects. Securities class action lawsuits are often instituted against companies following periods of stock market volatility. Such litigation is costly and diverts management\u2019s attention from productive efforts.\nFactors that may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate rapidly and widely include:\n\u2022changes in the expected or actual timing of our competitors\u2019 potential development programs, including developments in ANDA litigation and proceedings before the PTAB and the announcement of ANDA filings seeking approval for generic versions of Korlym;\n\u2022general market and economic conditions, including the economic, social and emotional costs and dislocations arising from the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022actual or anticipated variations in our operating results or changes to any public guidance we have provided;\n\u2022actual or anticipated timing and results of our clinical trials;\n\u2022disputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u2022short selling of our common stock, the publication of speculative opinions about our business or other market manipulation activities by third parties that are intended to lower our stock price or increase its volatility;\n\u2022changes in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts or the failure of our performance to meet the published expectations of those analysts or any public guidance we have provided;\n\u2022actual or anticipated regulatory approvals of our product candidates or of competing products;\n\u2022purchases or sales of our common stock by our officers, directors or stockholders;\n\u2022changes in laws or regulations applicable to our product candidates or our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u2022technological innovations by us, our collaborators or our competitors;\n\u2022changes in the trading volume of our common stock;\n\u2022conditions in the pharmaceutical industry, including the market valuations of companies similar to Corcept;\n\u2022additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, collaborations or capital commitments;\n\u2022additional financing activities; and\n\u2022our cash and short-term investment position.\nOur stock price may decline if our financial performance does not meet the guidance we have provided to the public, estimates published by research analysts or other investor expectations.\nThe guidance we provide as to our expected 2021 revenue is only an estimate of what we believe is realizable at the time we give such guidance. It is difficult to predict our revenue and our actual results may vary materially from our guidance. The effect on our business of the COVID-19 pandemic is difficult to estimate. In addition, the rate of physician adoption of Korlym and the actions of government and private payers is uncertain. We may experience competition from generic versions of Korlym, which our public revenue guidance does not anticipate. We may not meet our financial guidance or other investor expectations for other reasons, including those arising from the risks and uncertainties described in this report and in our other public filings and public statements. Research analysts publish estimates of our future revenue and earnings based on their own analysis. The revenue guidance we provide may be one factor they consider when determining their estimates.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe are subject to government regulation and other legal obligations relating to privacy and data protection. Compliance with these requirements is complex and costly. Failure to comply could materially harm our business.\nWe and our partners are subject to federal, state and foreign laws and regulations concerning data privacy and security, including HIPAA and the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR. These and other regulatory frameworks are evolving rapidly as new rules are enacted and existing ones updated and made more stringent.\nIn the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy, laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations (e.g., Section 5 of the FTC Act), that govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our partners. In addition, we may obtain health information from third parties (including research institutions from which we obtain clinical trial data) that are subject to privacy and security requirements under HIPAA. Depending on the facts and circumstances, we could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain, use, or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA.\nEven when HIPAA does not apply, according to the Federal Trade Commission or the FTC, violating consumers\u2019 privacy or failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers\u2019 personal information secure may constitute unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The FTC expects a\ncompany\u2019s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Individually identifiable health information is considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards.\nIn addition, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. For example, the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act imposes restrictive requirements regulating the use and disclosure of health information and other personally identifiable information. Further, on June 28, 2018, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or the CCPA, which took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA creates individual privacy rights for California consumers and increases the privacy and security obligations of entities handling certain personal information. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. The CCPA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Similar laws have been proposed at the federal level and in other states.\nThe GDPR went into effect in 2018 and has become binding against all EEA member states. It imposes stringent requirements for controllers and processors of personal data, particularly with respect to clinical trials. The GDPR provides that EEA member states may make their own further laws and regulations limiting the processing of health data, which could limit our ability to use and share personal data or could cause our costs to increase and harm our business and financial condition. In addition, the GDPR increases the scrutiny that clinical trial sites located in the EEA should apply to transfers of personal data from such sites to countries that are considered to lack an adequate level of data protection, such as the United States. Recent legal developments have also created complexity and compliance uncertainty regarding certain transfers of information from the EEA to the United States. For example, on June 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (\u201cCJEU\u201d) declared the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework to be invalid. As a result, Privacy Shield is no longer a valid mechanism for transferring personal data from the EU to the United States. Moreover, it is uncertain whether the standard contractual clauses will also be invalidated by the European courts or legislature. The GDPR imposes substantial fines for breaches of data protection requirements, which can be up to four percent of global revenue for the preceding financial year or \u20ac20 million, whichever is greater, and it also confers a private right of action on data subjects for breaches of data protection requirements. Compliance with European data protection laws is a rigorous and time intensive process that may increase our cost of doing business, and despite those efforts, there is a risk that we may be subject to fines and penalties, litigation and reputational harm in connection with our European activities. Additionally, following the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the EU, we have to comply with the GDPR and separately the GDPR as implemented in the United Kingdom, each regime having the ability to fine up to the greater of \u20ac20 million/ \u00a317.5 million or 4% of global turnover. The relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear, for example around how data can lawfully be transferred between each jurisdiction, which exposes us to further compliance risk.\nComplying with U.S. and foreign privacy and security laws and regulations is complex and costly. Failure to comply by us or our vendors could subject us to litigation, government enforcement actions and substantial penalties and fines, which could harm our business.\nWe rely heavily on information technology systems to conduct our business. A breakdown or breach of these systems or our failure to protect confidential information concerning our business, patients or employees could interrupt the operation of our business and subject us to liability.\nWe store valuable confidential information relating to our business, patients and employees on our computer networks and on the networks of our vendors. In addition, we rely heavily on internet technology, including video conference, teleconference and file-sharing services, to conduct business during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the implementation of security measures, our networks and the networks of our vendors are subject to the risk of cyberattacks, \u201cphishing\u201d attacks, computer hackers, service provider or vendor error, or malfeasance or other intentional or unintentional acts by third parties and bad actors, including vendors, computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and internet and electrical failures. They may also be manipulated by criminals seeking to commit fraud or theft.\nCOVID-19 may increase our cybersecurity risks, due to our reliance on internet technology and the number of our employees that are working remotely, which may create additional opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities. In addition, system failures could cause the loss, theft, exposure, or unauthorized access or use of valuable clinical trial data as a result of accidents, errors or malfeasance by our employees, independent contractors or others working with us or on our behalf or otherwise disrupt our clinical and commercial activities and be expensive and time-consuming to remedy. Our servers and systems, and those of our vendors, may be vulnerable to computer malware, break-ins, denial-of-service attacks, and similar\ndisruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems, which could result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our confidential information, including our clinical data, or the confidential information of our patients or employees.\nThe computer systems of the CRO that managed one of our early-stage clinical trials was breached and confidential information, including information about some of the patients who participated in our trial, was exposed. Under applicable law, this breach is the responsibility of the CRO, which has notified the affected patients and is cooperating closely with regulatory and law enforcement authorities. We do not expect this breach to have any impact on our development programs or financial performance.\nWe have experienced \u201cphishing\u201d attacks and other unauthorized access to certain data and information. There is no assurance that our cybersecurity systems and processes will be effective in preventing unauthorized access in the future. Furthermore, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or to sabotage, systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. We may also experience security breaches that remain undetected for an extended period.\nDisruptions or security breaches that result in the disclosure of confidential or proprietary information could cause us to incur liability and delay or otherwise harm our research, development and commercialization efforts. We may be liable for losses suffered by patients or employees or other individuals whose confidential information is stolen as a result of a breach of the security of the systems that we or third parties and our vendors store this information on, and any such liability could be material. Even if we are not liable for such losses, any breach of these systems could expose us to material costs in notifying affected individuals, as well as regulatory fines or penalties. In addition, any breach of these systems could disrupt our normal business operations and expose us to reputational damage and harm our business, operating results and financial condition. Any insurance we maintain against the risk of this type of loss may not be sufficient to cover actual losses, or may not apply to the circumstances relating to any particular loss.\nWe are dependent on the continued functioning of the FDA and other federal instrumentalities. Inadequate funding of these instrumentalities, their partial or complete closure, their diversion of resources to work on pandemic-related issues, or their inability to hire and retain talented professionals could materially harm our business.\nThe government\u2019s ability to carry out its mandated functions is affected by a variety of factors, including adequate government funding, the ability to hire and retain key personnel, statutory, regulatory and policy changes, possible diversion of resources and limited operating capacity and diversion of resources caused by the COVID-19 pandemic or other events that may reduce the government\u2019s ability to perform routine functions. Disruptions at the FDA and other agencies may slow the time to review new drug applications and respond to other inquiries. Disruptions at the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) may temporarily stop its ability to review and approve proposed financing transactions. Several times in the last few years, including for 35 days beginning on December 22, 2018, the U.S. government has shut down and many regulatory agencies, including the FDA and SEC, have had to furlough employees and stop critical activities. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, it could significantly impair the FDA, SEC and other authorities\u2019 ability to process our submissions, which could materially harm our business.\nSeparately, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 10, 2020 the FDA announced its intention to postpone most inspections of foreign manufacturing facilities, and on March 18, 2020, the FDA temporarily postponed routine surveillance inspections of domestic manufacturing facilities. Subsequently, on July 10, 2020 the FDA announced its intention to resume certain on-site inspections of domestic manufacturing facilities subject to a risk-based prioritization system. The FDA intends to use this risk-based assessment system to identify the categories of regulatory activity that can occur within a given geographic area, ranging from mission critical inspections to resumption of all regulatory activities. Regulatory authorities outside the United States may adopt similar restrictions or other policy measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, or if global health concerns continue to prevent the FDA or other regulatory authorities from conducting their regular inspections, reviews, or other regulatory activities, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA or other regulatory authorities to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nChanges in federal, state and local tax laws may reduce our net earnings.\nOur earnings are subject to federal, state and local tax. We offset a portion of our earnings using net operating losses and our taxes using research and development tax credits, which reduces the amount of tax we pay. Some jurisdictions require that we pay taxes or fees calculated as a percentage of sales, payroll expense, or other indicia of our activities. Please see \u201cPart IV, Item 16, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Income Taxes.\u201d Changes to existing tax laws that we cannot control or predict could materially increase the amount of taxes and fees we must pay. For example, an increase in income tax rates or a reduction or elimination of net operating losses and research and development tax credits could significantly increase our tax expense, which would reduce our net income and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may be unable to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals for our product or product candidates.\nWe cannot promote a product candidate unless the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities approves it, which may not happen. Obtaining regulatory approval of a drug is difficult, uncertain, lengthy and expensive. Failure can occur at any stage. In order to receive FDA approval, we must demonstrate to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction that the new drug is safe and effective for its intended use and that our manufacturing processes comply with cGMPs. Our inability or the inability of our vendors to comply with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements can result in delays in or denials of new product approvals, warning letters, fines, consent decrees restricting or suspending manufacturing operations, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of product sales and criminal prosecution. Any of these or other regulatory actions could materially harm our business and financial condition.\nIf we receive regulatory approval for a product candidate, we will be subject to ongoing FDA requirements and oversight, such as continued safety and other reporting requirements and post-marketing restrictions. If we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may not be permitted to develop our product candidates or market our products and may be subject to product recalls or seizures. Any regulatory approvals for our product candidates may require costly post-marketing studies. Future governmental action or changes in FDA policy or personnel may also result in delays or rejection of an NDA or supplemental NDA.\nWe may face competition from companies with greater financial, technical and marketing resources than our own.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is competitive and subject to rapid technological change. Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical companies, which have greater clinical, marketing and sales resources than our own and may develop and commercialize medications that are superior to and less expensive than ours, which could negatively affect our financial results.\nIf we acquire products or product candidates, we will incur significant costs and may not realize the benefits we anticipate.\nWe may acquire a product or product candidate that complements our strategic plan. Such an acquisition may give rise to unforeseen difficulties and costs and may absorb significant management attention. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, which could dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership interest or cause us to incur significant expenses and debt.\nOur ability to compete could be diminished if we are unable to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information.\nIn addition to patents, we rely on a combination of confidentiality, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions, laws protecting trade secrets and security measures to protect our proprietary information. These measures may not be adequate, in which case competitors could exploit our proprietary information to our disadvantage. If employees, consultants or anyone else breaches their agreements with us regarding our proprietary information, we may not have adequate remedies for the breach.\nResearch analysts may not continue to provide or initiate coverage of our common stock or may issue negative reports.\nThe market for our common stock may be affected by the reports financial analysts publish about us. If any of the analysts covering us downgrades or discontinues coverage of our stock, the price of our common stock could decline rapidly and significantly. Paucity of research coverage may also adversely affect our stock price.\nSale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause its price to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our stock in the public market could reduce its price. As additional shares of our stock become available for public resale, whether by the exercise of stock options by employees or directors or because of an equity financing by us, the supply of our stock will increase, which could cause its price to fall. Substantially all of the shares of our stock are eligible for sale, subject to applicable volume and other resale restrictions.\nChanges in laws and regulations may significantly increase our costs, which could harm our financial results.\nNew laws and regulations, as well as changes to existing laws and regulations, including statutes and regulations concerning taxes and the development, approval, and marketing of medications, the provisions of the ACA requiring the reporting of aggregate spending related to health care professionals, the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules adopted by the SEC and by The Nasdaq Stock Market have and will likely continue to increase our cost of doing business and divert management\u2019s attention from revenue-generating activities.\nWe may fail to comply with our public company obligations, including securities laws and regulations. Such compliance is costly and requires significant management attention.\nThe federal securities laws and regulations, including the corporate governance and other requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, impose complex and continually changing regulatory requirements on our operations and reporting. These developing requirements will continue to increase our compliance costs. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that we evaluate the effectiveness of, and provide a management report with respect to, our internal controls over financial reporting. It also requires that the independent registered public accounting firm auditing our consolidated financial statements must attest to and report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. If we are unable to complete the required assessment and report or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to issue an unqualified opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in our financial reporting and our stock price would likely decline.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter and bylaws and under Delaware law may make an acquisition of us or a change in our management more expensive or difficult, even if an acquisition or a management change would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nProvisions in our charter and bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us or a change in our management. Some of these provisions allow us to issue preferred stock without any vote or further action by the stockholders, require advance notification of stockholder proposals and nominations of candidates for election as directors and prohibit stockholders from acting by written consent. In addition, a supermajority vote of stockholders is required to amend our bylaws. Our bylaws provide that special meetings of the stockholders may be called only by our Chairman, President or the Board of Directors and that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the Board of Directors. These provisions may prevent or delay a change in our Board of Directors or our management, which our Board of Directors appoints. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Section 203 may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15 percent or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us. These provisions in our charter and bylaws and under Delaware law could reduce the price that investors would be willing to pay for shares of our common stock.\nOur officers, directors and principal stockholders, acting as a group, could significantly influence corporate actions.\nAs of February 17, 2021, our officers and directors beneficially owned approximately 16 percent of our common stock. Acting together, these stockholders could significantly influence any matter requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combinations. The interests of this group may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders and may prevent or delay a change in control. This significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock because many investors perceive disadvantages to owning stock in companies with controlling stockholders.", "PERMNO": 90125, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "CORT"}
