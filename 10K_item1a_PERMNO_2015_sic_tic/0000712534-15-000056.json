RISK FACTORS\nRISK FACTORS\nThere are a number of factors, including those specified below, that may adversely affect the Corporation\u2019s business, financial results or stock price. Additional risks that the Corporation currently does not know about or currently views as immaterial may also impair the Corporation\u2019s business or adversely impact its financial results or stock price.\nINDUSTRY AND CORPORATE RISK FACTORS\nThe Corporation\u2019s business and financial results are significantly affected by general business and economic conditions.\nThe Corporation\u2019s business activities and earnings are affected by general business conditions in the United States and abroad. These conditions include short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation, monetary supply, fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets, and the strength of the United States economy and the state and local economies in which the Corporation operates. For example, a prolonged economic downturn, continued increase in unemployment, or other events that affect household and/or corporate incomes could result in deterioration of credit quality, an increase in the allowance for loan losses, or reduced demand for loan or fee-based products and services. Changes in the financial performance and condition of the Corporation\u2019s borrowers could negatively affect repayment of those borrowers\u2019 loans. In addition, changes in securities market conditions and monetary fluctuations could adversely affect the availability and terms of funding necessary to meet the Corporation\u2019s liquidity needs.\n\u2022\nChanges in the domestic interest rate environment could reduce the Corporation\u2019s net interest income.\nThe operations of financial institutions, such as the Corporation, are dependent to a large degree on net interest income, which is the difference between interest income from loans and investments and interest expense on deposits and borrowings. An institution\u2019s net interest income is significantly affected by market rates of interest, which in turn are affected by prevailing economic conditions, by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and by the policies of various regulatory agencies. Like all financial institutions, the Corporation\u2019s balance sheet is affected by fluctuations in interest rates. Volatility in interest rates can also result in the flow of funds away from financial institutions into direct investments. Direct investments, such as U.S. Government and corporate securities and other investment vehicles, including mutual funds, generally pay higher rates of return than financial institutions, because of the absence of federal insurance premiums and reserve requirements.\n\u2022\nChanges in the laws, regulations and policies governing banks and financial services companies could alter the Corporation\u2019s business environment and adversely affect operations.\nThe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. Its fiscal and monetary policies determine in a large part the Corporation\u2019s cost of funds for lending and investing and the return that can be earned on those loans and investments, both of which affect the Corporation\u2019s net interest margin. Federal Reserve Board policies can also materially affect the value of financial instruments that the Corporation holds, such as debt securities. The Corporation and the Bank are heavily regulated at the federal and state levels. This regulation is to protect depositors, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole. Congress and state legislatures and federal and state agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. Changes in statutes, regulations or policies could affect the Corporation in substantial and unpredictable ways, including limiting the types of financial services and products that the Corporation offers and/or increasing the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products.\nThe Corporation cannot predict whether any of this potential legislation will be enacted, and if enacted, the effect that it or any regulations would have on the Corporation\u2019s financial condition or results of operations. See a description of recent legislation in the \u201cLegislature and Regulatory Initiatives to Address Financial and Economic Crises\u201d section of Item 1: Business of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\u2022\nThe banking and financial services industry is highly competitive, and competitive pressures could intensify and adversely affect the Corporation\u2019s financial results.\nThe Corporation operates in a highly competitive industry that could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. The Corporation competes with other banks, savings and loan associations, mutual savings banks, finance companies, mortgage banking companies, credit unions and investment companies. In addition, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks. Many of the Corporation\u2019s competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and some have lower cost structures. Also, the potential need to adapt to industry changes in information technology systems, on which the Corporation and financial services industry are highly dependent, could present operational issues and require capital spending.\n\u2022\nActs or threats of terrorism and political or military actions taken by the United States or other governments could adversely affect general economic or industry conditions.\nGeopolitical conditions may also affect the Corporation\u2019s earnings. Acts or threats of terrorism and political or military actions taken by the United States or other governments in response to terrorism, or similar activity, could adversely affect general economic or industry conditions.\nPART I: ITEM 1A.
