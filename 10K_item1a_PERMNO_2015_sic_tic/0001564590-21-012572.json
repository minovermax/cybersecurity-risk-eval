The risks described below represent all of the material risks currently known to us; however, they are not the only ones the Company faces. Additional risks that are currently unknown to the Company or that the Company currently considers to be immaterial may also impair its business or adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition or results of operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operation could be adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to the Company\u2019s Business and Operations\nA future substantial deterioration in economic conditions, especially in the United States and Europe, would adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations and cash flows.\nEconomic conditions affect the Company\u2019s sales volumes, pricing levels and overall profitability. Demand for many of the Company\u2019s products depends on end-use markets. Challenging economic conditions may reduce demand for our products and may also impair the ability of customers to pay for products they have purchased. As a result, the Company\u2019s reserves for doubtful accounts and write-offs for accounts receivable may increase. Significant deterioration in economic conditions, especially in the United States and Europe, has had and may again have negative effects on the Company\u2019s results of operations and cash flows.\nA significant deterioration in economic conditions has caused and may again cause deterioration in the credit quality of our customers and the estimated residual value of our equipment. This could further negatively impact the ability of our customers to obtain the resources they need to make purchases of our equipment. Reduced credit availability will diminish our customers\u2019 ability to invest in their businesses, refinance maturing debt obligations, and meet ongoing working capital needs. If customers do not have sufficient access to credit, demand for the Company\u2019s products will likely decline. Reduced access to credit and the capital markets will also negatively affect the Company\u2019s ability to invest in strategic growth initiatives such as acquisitions.\nCOVID-19 and related economic conditions, including the Company\u2019s assessment of the vulnerability of our customers and vendors in relation to the economic disruptions associated with COVID-19, are continuing to negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe global outbreak of COVID-19 severely restricted the level of economic activity in many parts of the world. In response to this outbreak, the governments of many countries, states, cities and other geographic regions have taken a variety of preventative or protective actions, such as imposing restrictions on travel and business operations. While some countries have experienced declining numbers of COVID-19 cases and have therefore reversed some of these preventative and protective measures, others, including many areas of the United States, have experienced increases in COVID-19 cases and have implemented or are considering implementing or re-implementing such actions. These measures, while intended to curtail the spread of COVID-19, have had and are expected to continue to have significant adverse impacts of uncertain severity and duration on domestic and foreign economies. The outbreak and continued spread of COVID-19 have resulted in a global economic slowdown. Currently, the effectiveness of economic stabilization efforts and other measures being taken to mitigate the effects of these actions and the spread of COVID-19, including the development, approval and distribution of vaccines, is uncertain.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we and our affiliates, employees, suppliers, customers and others have been and may continue to be restricted or prevented from conducting normal business activities, including as a result of shutdowns, travel restrictions and other actions that may be recommended or mandated by governmental authorities. Such actions have prevented, and may in the future prevent us from accessing the facilities of our customers to provide services. While a substantial portion of our businesses have been classified as an essential business in jurisdictions in which facility closures have been mandated, we can give no assurance that there will not be closures in the future or that our businesses will be classified as essential in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has impacted, and may continue to impact, our office locations and manufacturing facilities, as well as those of our third-party vendors, including the effects of facility closures, reductions in operating hours and other social distancing efforts. In addition, we have modified our business practices (including practices regarding employee travel, employee work locations, and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences), and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, suppliers and other partners. These modifications to our business practices may cause us to experience reductions in productivity and disruptions to our business routines. Further, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, disruptions or delays in our supply chain as a result of such actions, which has resulted in higher supply chain costs to us in order to maintain an adequate supply of materials and components for our products.\nOur management of the impact of COVID-19 has and will continue to require significant investment of time from our management and employees, as well as resources across our global enterprise. The focus on managing and mitigating the impacts of COVID-19 on our business may cause us to divert or delay the application of our resources toward new initiatives or investments, which may adversely impact our future results of operations. In addition, issues relating to the COVID-19 pandemic may result in legal claims or litigation against us.\nWe may also experience impacts from market downturns and changes in consumer behavior related to pandemic fears as a result of COVID-19. In addition, our customers may choose to delay or abandon projects on which we provide products. We may also experience adverse impacts on demand and sales volumes from industries that are sensitive to economic downturns and volatility in commodity prices. If these adverse impacts continue, our stock price and the operating performances of our businesses could be adversely affected, which could require us to incur material impairment, restructuring or other charges.\nFurther, the impact of COVID-19 may cause significant uncertainty and volatility in the credit markets. We rely on the credit markets to provide us with liquidity to operate and grow our businesses beyond the liquidity that our operating cash flows provide. If our access to capital were to become significantly constrained or if costs of capital increased significantly due the impact of COVID-19, including volatility in the capital markets, or other factors, then our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nLastly, if the COVID-19 pandemic becomes more pronounced in our global markets, or resurges in markets recovering from the pandemic, our operations in impacted areas could experience further adverse financial impacts due to market changes and other resulting events and circumstances. The extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak impacts our financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19, the longevity of COVID-19, the impact of COVID-19 on economic activity, and the actions to contain its impacts on public health and the global economy. The impact of COVID-19 may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, any of which could have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur revenues and profitability are impacted by government spending, fluctuations in the construction industry, and capital expenditures in the oil and gas industry.\nMany of the Company\u2019s customers depend substantially on government spending, including highway construction and maintenance and other infrastructure projects by U.S. federal and state governments as well as foreign governments. Any decrease or delay in government funding of highway construction and maintenance and other infrastructure projects could cause the Company\u2019s revenues and profits to decrease.\nThe demand for our product in part depends on the condition of the oil and gas industry and, in particular, on the level of capital expenditures of companies engaged in the exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas. Capital expenditures by these companies are influenced by the following factors:\n\u2022\nthe oil and gas industry\u2019s ability to economically justify placing discoveries of oil and gas reserves in production;\n\u2022\ncurrent and projected oil and gas prices;\n\u2022\nthe oil and gas industry\u2019s need to clear all structures from the lease once the oil and gas reserves have been depleted;\n\u2022\nweather events, such as major tropical storms;\n\u2022\nthe abilities of oil and gas companies to generate, access and deploy capital;\n\u2022\nexploration, production and transportation costs;\n\u2022\nthe discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves;\n\u2022\nthe sale and expiration dates of oil and gas leases and concessions;\n\u2022\nlocal and international political and economic conditions;\n\u2022\nthe ability or willingness of host country government entities to fund their budgetary commitments; and\n\u2022\ntechnological advances.\nHistorically, prices of oil and natural gas and exploration, development and production have fluctuated substantially. A sustained period of substantially reduced capital expenditures by oil and gas companies will result in decreased demand for certain equipment produced by the Company, lower margins, and possibly net losses. Additionally, oil and gas companies may sell excess equipment into the general construction market which could further depress demand for certain of products.\nThe Company\u2019s level of indebtedness reduces our financial flexibility and meeting financial covenants required by our debt agreements could impede our ability to successfully operate.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s total debt was $47.3 million, which includes notes payable and capital lease obligations.\nOur level of debt affects our operations in several important ways, including the following:\n\u2022\na significant portion of our cash flow from operations is likely to be dedicated to the payment of the principal and interest on our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures or acquisitions may be limited;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all;\n\u2022\nour cash flow may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments; and\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to obtain additional loans as a result of covenants and agreements with existing debt holders.\nThe Company\u2019s existing debt agreements contain a number of significant covenants which may limit our ability to, among other things, borrow additional money, make capital expenditures, pay dividends, dispose of assets and acquire new businesses. These covenants also require the Company to meet certain financial and non-financial tests. A default or other event of non-compliance, if not waived or otherwise permitted by the Company\u2019s lenders, could result in acceleration of the Company\u2019s debt and possibly bankruptcy.\nThe Company may be unable to negotiate extensions of our credit agreements and to obtain additional debt or equity financing when needed.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on the amount of cash generated or required by our current operations, as well as additional funds which may be needed to finance future acquisitions. Future cash needs are subject to substantial uncertainty.\nAdequate funds may not be available when needed, and if we do not receive sufficient capital, we may be required to alter or reduce the scope of our operations or to forego making future acquisitions. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, existing stockholders may be diluted.\nThe remediation of the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting has caused us to incur substantial audit, legal and other costs, and may reduce investor confidence in our financial statements.\nWe incur substantial unanticipated expenses and costs, including audit, legal and other professional fees, in connection with the ongoing remediation of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. Certain remediation actions were recommended, and we are in the process of implementing them (see Item 9A \"Controls and Procedures\" of this Form 10-K for a description of these remediation measures). To the extent these steps are not successful, we could be forced to incur additional time and expense. In addition, these ongoing remediation efforts have diverted our management\u2019s attention away from the operation of our business.\nThe Company\u2019s business is affected by the cyclical nature of its markets.\nA substantial portion of our revenues are attributed to a limited number of customers which may decrease or cease purchasing any time, since the Company\u2019s products depends upon the general economic conditions of the markets in which the Company competes. The Company\u2019s sales depend in part upon its customers\u2019 replacement or repair cycles. Adverse economic conditions, including a decrease in commodity prices, may cause customers to forego or postpone new purchases in favor of repairing existing machinery. Downward economic cycles may result in reductions in sales of the Company\u2019s products, which may reduce the Company\u2019s profits.\nThe Company\u2019s business is sensitive to increases in interest rates.\nThe Company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed rate debt and existing issuances of variable rate debt. In addition, our credit agreement indebtedness may use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing our interest rate. LIBOR is\nthe subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms and other pressures may cause LIBOR to perform differently than in the past or to be replaced entirely. The consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted but could include an increase in the cost of our credit agreement indebtedness.\nIf interest rates rise, it becomes costlier for the Company\u2019s customers to borrow money to pay for the equipment they buy from the Company. Should the U.S. Federal Reserve Board decide to increase rates, prospects for business investment and manufacturing could deteriorate sufficiently and impact sales opportunities.\nOur increasingly international operations expose us to additional risks and challenges associated with conducting business internationally.\nThe international expansion of our business may expose us to risks inherent in conducting foreign operations. These risks include:\n\u2022\nchallenges associated with managing geographically diverse operations, which require an effective organizational structure and appropriate business processes, procedures and controls;\n\u2022\nthe increased cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions, including compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations;\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange and interest rate fluctuations and the resulting effect on our revenue and expenses, and the cost and risk of entering into hedging transactions, if we continue to do so in the future;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences;\n\u2022\ncomplexities and difficulties in obtaining protection and enforcing our intellectual property;\n\u2022\ncompliance with additional regulations and government authorities in a highly regulated business;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and political conditions internationally; and\n\u2022\npublic health concerns, including the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.\nAdditionally, changes to the United States\u2019 participation in, withdrawal from, renegotiation of certain international trade agreements or other major trade related issues including the non-renewal of expiring favorable tariffs granted to developing countries, tariff quotas, and retaliatory tariffs (including, but not limited to, the current United States administration\u2019s tariffs on China and China's retaliatory tariffs on certain products from the United States), trade sanctions, new or onerous trade restrictions, embargoes and other stringent government controls could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe risks that the Company faces in its international operations may continue to intensify if the Company further develops and expands its international operations.\nThe Company may face limitations on its ability to integrate acquired businesses and manage anticipated growth, and may be unable to effectively respond to technological change and implementing new systems.\nThe successful integration of new businesses depends on the Company\u2019s ability to manage these new businesses and cut excess costs. While the Company believes it has successfully integrated these acquisitions to date, the Company cannot ensure that these acquired companies will operate profitably or that the intended beneficial effect from these acquisitions will be realized.\nIf the Company fails to manage growth, the Company\u2019s financial results and business prospects may be harmed. To manage the Company\u2019s growth and to execute its business plan efficiently, the Company will need to institute, maintain and continue to improve operational, financial and management controls, as well as reporting systems and procedures. The Company also must effectively expand, train and manage its employee base. The Company cannot assure you that it will be successful in any of these endeavors.\nThe markets served by the Company are not historically characterized by rapidly changing technology. Nevertheless, the Company\u2019s future success will depend in part upon the Company\u2019s ability to enhance its current products and to develop and introduce new products. If the Company fails to anticipate or respond adequately to competitors\u2019 product improvements and new production introductions, future results of operations and financial condition will be negatively affected.\nSome of our customers rely on financing with third parties to purchase our products.\nWe rely on sales of our products to generate cash from operations. Significant portions of our sales are financed by third party finance companies on behalf of our customers. The availability and terms of financing by third parties are affected by general economic conditions, credit worthiness of our customers and estimated residual value of our equipment. Deterioration in credit quality of our\ncustomers or estimated residual value of our equipment, increases in interest rates or changes in the terms of third party financing agreements could negatively impact the ability or willingness of our customers to obtain resources they need to purchase our equipment. There can be no assurance third party finance companies will continue to extend credit to our customers.\nThe Company operates in a highly competitive industry and the Company is particularly subject to the risks of such competition.\nThe Company competes in a highly competitive industry and the competition which the Company encounters has an effect on its product prices, market share, revenues and profitability. Because certain competitors have substantially greater financial, production, research and development resources and substantially greater name recognition than the Company, the Company is particularly subject to the risks inherent in competing with them and may be put at a competitive disadvantage. To compete successfully, the Company\u2019s products must excel in terms of quality, price, product line, ease of use, safety and comfort, and the Company must also provide excellent customer service. The greater financial resources of the Company\u2019s competitors may put it at a competitive disadvantage. If competition in the Company\u2019s industry intensifies or if the Company\u2019s current competitors enhance their products or lower their prices for competing products, the Company may lose sales or be required to lower its prices. This may reduce revenue from the Company\u2019s products and services, lower its gross margins or cause the Company to lose market share. The Company may not be able to differentiate our products from those of competitors, successfully develop or introduce less costly products, offer better performance than competitors or offer purchasers of our products payment and other commercial terms as favorable as those offered by competitors.\nThe Company is dependent upon third-party suppliers, making us vulnerable to supply shortages.\nThe Company obtains materials and manufactured components from third-party suppliers. Any delay in the ability of the Company\u2019s suppliers to provide the Company with necessary materials and components may affect the Company\u2019s capabilities at a number of our manufacturing locations, or may require the Company to seek alternative supply sources. Delays in obtaining supplies may result from a number of factors affecting the Company\u2019s suppliers including capacity constraints, labor disputes, the impaired financial condition of a particular supplier, suppliers\u2019 allocations to other purchasers, difficulties in obtaining raw materials, shipping delays or disruptions, public health emergencies, weather emergencies or acts of war or terrorism. Any delay in receiving supplies could impair the Company\u2019s ability to deliver products to customers and, accordingly, could have a material adverse effect on business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, the Company purchases materials and services from suppliers on extended terms based on the Company\u2019s overall credit rating. Negative changes in the Company\u2019s credit rating may impact suppliers\u2019 willingness to extend terms and increase the cash requirements of the business.\nPrice increases in materials could reduce our profitability.\nWe use large amounts of steel and other items in the manufacture of our products. In the past, market prices of some of our key raw materials increased significantly. If we experience future significant increases in material costs, including steel, we may not be able to reduce product cost in other areas or pass future raw material price increases on to our customers and our margins could be adversely affected.\nThe Company faces product liability claims and other liabilities due to the nature of its business.\nIn the Company\u2019s lines of business numerous suits have been filed alleging damages for accidents that have occurred during the use or operation of the Company\u2019s products. The Company is self-insured, up to certain limits, for these product liability exposures, as well as for certain exposures related to general, workers\u2019 compensation and automobile liability. Insurance coverage is obtained for catastrophic losses as well as those risks required to be insured by law or contract. Any material liabilities not covered by insurance could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends upon the continued protection of its trademarks and the Company may be forced to incur substantial costs to maintain, defend, protect and enforce its intellectual property rights.\nThe Company\u2019s registered and common law trademarks, as well as certain of the Company\u2019s licensed trademarks, have significant value and are instrumental to the Company\u2019s ability to market its products. The Company\u2019s trademarks \u201cManitex\u201d, \u201cBadger\u201d, \u201cValla\u201d, \u201cPM\u201d and \u201cO&S\u201d are important to the Company\u2019s business as the majority of the Company\u2019s products are sold under those names. The Company has not registered all of its trademarks in the United States nor in the foreign countries where it does business. Third parties could assert claims against such intellectual property that the Company could be unable to successfully resolve. If the Company has to change the names of any of its products, it may experience a loss of goodwill associated with its brand names, customer confusion and a loss of sales.\nIn addition, international protection of the Company\u2019s intellectual property may not be available in some foreign countries to the same extent permitted by the laws of the United States. The Company could also incur substantial costs to defend legal actions relating to use of its intellectual property, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe Company may be unable to access the capital markets to raise funds and provide liquidity when needed.\nOur access to capital markets to raise funds through the sale of equity or debt securities is subject to various factors, including general economic and/or financial market conditions which are outside our control, as well as our historical and expected future financial performance and perceived credit worthiness. Significant changes in market liquidity conditions or our actual or perceived financial condition could impact access to funding and associated funding costs, which could reduce our earnings and cash flows.\nThe Company is subject to currency fluctuations.\nThe reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the U.S. dollar. Certain of our assets, liabilities, expenses, revenues and earnings are denominated in other countries\u2019 currencies, including the Euro, Chilean peso, and Argentinean peso. Those assets, liabilities, expenses, revenues and earnings are translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates to prepare our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, increases or decreases in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and those other currencies affect the value of those items as reflected in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value remains unchanged in their original currency. Due to the continued volatility of foreign currency exchange rates to the U.S. dollar, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may have an impact on the accuracy of our financial guidance. Such fluctuations in foreign currency rates relative to the U.S. dollar may cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in our guidance and have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nCompliance with changing laws and regulations may increase our costs or reduce our business flexibility.\nOur operations are subject to a number of potential risks. Such risks principally include:\n\u2022\ntrade protection measures and currency exchange controls;\n\u2022\nlabor unrest;\n\u2022\nglobal and regional economic conditions;\n\u2022\npolitical instability;\n\u2022\nterrorist activities and the U.S. and international response thereto;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the transfer of funds into or out of a country;\n\u2022\nexport duties and quotas;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign customs and tariffs;\n\u2022\ncurrent and changing regulatory environments;\n\u2022\ndifficulties protecting our intellectual property;\n\u2022\ntransportation delays and interruptions;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in obtaining distribution support;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters; and\n\u2022\ncurrent and changing tax laws.\nWe must comply with all applicable laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and other laws that prohibit engaging in corruption for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. These anti-corruption laws prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence government officials or private individuals for the purpose of obtaining or retaining a business advantage regardless of whether those practices are legal or culturally expected in a particular jurisdiction. Our global activities and distribution model are subject to risk of corruption by our employees and in addition, our sales agents, distributors, dealers and other third parties that transact Manitex business particularly because these parties are generally not subject to our control. We have an internal policy that expressly prohibits engaging in any commercial bribery and public corruption, including facilitation payments.\nThe Company\u2019s revenues are attributed to limited number of customers which may decrease or cease purchasing any time.\nThe Company\u2019s revenues are attributed to a limited number of customers. We generally do not have long-term supply agreements with our customers. Even if a multi-year contract exists, the customer is not required to commit to minimum purchases and can cease purchasing at any time. If we were to lose either a significant customer or several smaller customers our operating results and cash flows would be adversely impacted.\nThe Company depends on its information technology systems. If its information technology systems do not perform in a satisfactory manner or if the security of them is breached, it could be disruptive and or adversely affect the operations and results of operations of the Company.\nThe Company depends on its information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information (including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees, customers and other business partners), and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities. If our information technology systems do not perform in a satisfactory manner, it could be disruptive and or adversely affect the operations and results of operations of the Company, including the ability of the Company to report accurate and timely financial results.\nFurthermore, our information technology systems may be damaged, disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers, computer viruses, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication or utility failures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events, and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. A failure of or breach in information technology security could expose us and our customers, distributors and suppliers to risks of misuse of information or systems, the compromise of confidential information, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operations disruptions. In addition, such breaches in security could result in litigation, regulatory action and potential liability, as well as the costs and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nAs noted in item 9A below, the Company did not maintain an effective control environment over the information technology general controls based upon the criteria established in the COSO framework, to enable identification and mitigation of risks of material accounting errors. The Company has developed and is implementing a remediation plan to address this issue. See Item 9A \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d for further information.\nThe Company relies on key management.\nThe Company relies on the management and leadership skills of Steve Filipov, its Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Filipov entered into an employment agreement commencing on September 1, 2019. Under the employment agreement, Mr. Filipov\u2019s employment term automatically extends for successive periods of three years unless either the Company or Mr. Filipov gives written notice to the other party of non-renewal at least 90 days prior to the end of the then current employment term. The loss of his services could have a significant and negative impact on the Company\u2019s business. In addition, the Company relies on the management and leadership skills of other senior executives. The Company could be harmed by the loss of key personnel in the future.\nThe Company may be required to record goodwill or other intangible impairment charges on all or a significant amount of the goodwill or intangibles on its Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had approximately $27.5 million of goodwill and $15.7 million of net intangibles. The Company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually. If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess, as occurred in both 2020 and 2019. An impairment of a significant portion of goodwill could materially negatively affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company received a loan under the Paycheck Protection Program of the CARES Act, and all or a portion of the loan may not be forgivable.\nOn April 14, 2020, the Company and its United States subsidiaries received a loan under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which is part of the recently enacted CARES Act. The Company received total proceeds of $3.7 million from the PPP loan, and in accordance with the requirements of the PPP, the Company used proceeds from the PPP loan primarily for payroll costs. The loan is recorded on the balance sheet in current liabilities as deferred income liability and cash provided by operating activities on the statement of cash flows. We have applied to have this loan forgiven in accordance with applicable provisions of the PPP loan program, and we anticipate that this application will be approved. However, we cannot provide any assurance that any amount of the PPP loan will ultimately be forgiven.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nThe Company\u2019s principal shareholders, executive officers and directors hold a significant percentage of the Company\u2019s common stock, and these shareholders may take actions that may be adverse to your interests.\nThe Company\u2019s principal shareholders, executive officers and directors beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 39% of the Company\u2019s common stock as of February 1, 2021. As a result, these shareholders, acting together, will be able to significantly influence all matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election and removal of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions such as mergers, consolidations, sales and purchases of assets. They also could dictate the management of the\nCompany\u2019s business and affairs. This concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control or impeding a merger or consolidation, takeover or other business combination, even if smaller shareholders support such a transaction, which could cause the market price of our common stock to fall or prevent smaller shareholders from receiving a premium in such a transaction.\nProvisions of the Michigan Business Corporation Act and the Company\u2019s Articles of Incorporation, Amended and Restated Bylaws, and Rights Agreement may discourage or prevent a takeover of the Company.\nProvisions of the Company\u2019s Articles of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws, Michigan law, and the Rights Agreement, as amended, between the Company and Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solution, Inc., as rights agent, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the Company, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to you. These provisions could discourage potential takeover attempts and could adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s shares.
