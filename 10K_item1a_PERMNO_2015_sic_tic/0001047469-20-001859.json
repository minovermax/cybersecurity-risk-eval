RISK FACTORS\nThe material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect us are described below. Any of these risks, if they are realized, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and consequently, the market value of our common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect us. This Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. If any of the matters included in the following information about risk factors were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur business and operations may be materially adversely affected by weak economic conditions.\nOur business and operations, which primarily consist of banking activities, including lending money to customers and borrowing money from customers in the form of deposits, are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the U.S. generally, and in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area in particular. The economic conditions in our local markets may be different from the economic conditions in the U.S. as a whole. If economic conditions in the U.S. or any of our markets weaken, our growth and profitability from our operations could be constrained. In addition, foreign economic and political conditions could affect the stability of global financial markets, which could hinder economic growth. The current economic environment is characterized by interest rates gradually increasing from near historically low levels, which could impact our ability to attract deposits and to generate attractive earnings through our loan and investment portfolios. All these factors can individually or in the aggregate be detrimental to our business, and the interplay between these factors can be complex and unpredictable. Unfavorable market conditions, including as a result of events such as the recent coronavirus outbreak and related disruptions, can result in a deterioration in the credit quality of our borrowers and the demand for our products and services, an increase in the number of loan delinquencies, defaults and charge-offs, additional provisions for loan losses, a decline in the value of our collateral, and an overall material adverse effect on the quality of our loan portfolio.\nOur business is also significantly affected by monetary and related policies of the U.S. federal government and its agencies. Uncertainty about the federal fiscal policymaking process, the medium and long-term fiscal outlook of the federal government, and future tax rates are concerns for businesses, consumers and investors in the U.S. Changes in any of these policies are influenced by macroeconomic conditions and other factors that are beyond our control. Adverse economic conditions and government policy responses to such conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nWe are subject to interest rate risk, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nOur profitability, like that of most financial institutions, depends to a large extent on our net interest income, which is the difference between our interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and our interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings.\nInterest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Federal Reserve. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and securities and the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could affect our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities, and the average duration of our assets. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, our net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected.\nEarnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. Any substantial, unexpected or prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur interest sensitivity profile was slightly asset sensitive as of December 31, 2019. As a result, we would expect small increases in net interest income if interest rates rise, and small declines in the event rates fall. However, such expectations are based on our assumptions as to deposit customer behavior in an increasing rate scenario. When short-term interest rates rise, the rate of interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities may rise more quickly than the rate of interest that we receive on our interest-earning assets, which may cause our net interest income to decrease. Additionally, a shrinking yield premium between short-term and long-term market interest rates, a pattern usually indicative of investors' waning expectations of future growth and inflation, commonly referred to as a flattening of the yield curve, typically reduces our profit margin as we borrow at shorter terms than the terms at which we lend and invest.\nIn addition, an increase in interest rates could also have a negative impact on our results of operations by reducing the ability of borrowers to repay their current loan obligations. These circumstances could not only result in increased loan defaults, foreclosures and charge-offs, but also reduce collateral values and necessitate further increases to the allowance for loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to credit risk, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nOur business depends on our ability to successfully measure and manage credit risk. As a lender, we are exposed to the risk that the principal of, or interest on, a loan will not be paid timely or at all or that the value of any collateral supporting a loan will be insufficient to cover our outstanding exposure. In addition, we are exposed to risks with respect to the period of time over which the loan may be repaid, risks relating to loan underwriting, risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions, and risks inherent in dealing with individual loans and borrowers. The creditworthiness of a borrower is affected by many factors including local market conditions and general economic conditions. If the overall economic climate in the U.S. generally, or in our market areas specifically, experiences material disruption, including as a result of events such as the recent coronavirus outbreak and related disruptions, our borrowers may experience difficulties in repaying their loans, the collateral we hold may decrease in value or become illiquid, and our level of nonperforming loans, charge-offs and delinquencies could rise and require significant additional provisions for loan losses.\nOur risk management practices, such as monitoring the concentrations of our loans and our credit approval, review and administrative practices, may not adequately reduce credit risk, and our credit administration personnel, policies and procedures may not adequately adapt to changes in economic or any other conditions affecting related customers and the quality of the loan portfolio. Many of our loans are made to small businesses that are less able to withstand competitive, economic and financial pressures than larger borrowers. Consequently, we may have significant exposure if any of these borrowers becomes unable to pay their loan obligations as a result of economic or market conditions, or personal circumstances, such as divorce, unemployment or death. A failure to effectively measure and limit the credit risk associated with our loan portfolio may result in loan defaults, foreclosures and additional charge-offs, and may necessitate that we significantly increase our allowance for loan losses, each of which could adversely affect our net income. As a result, our inability to successfully manage credit risk could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLosses related to any single loan could have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWhile our average funded loan size is relatively small compared to our legal lending limit, averaging $1.4 million for commercial real estate loans (including construction) and approximately $228 thousand for commercial and industrial loans, at December 31, 2019, our legal lending limit has increased, and we have originated larger loans in recent years. As a result of our commercial real estate lending, the loan portfolio contains approximately 12 loans which have balances in excess of 5% of our shareholder's equity, and our largest single exposure is $25.5 million, while our largest exposure to one borrower is $26.2 million. Additionally, commercial and industrial loans not primarily secured by real estate are typically made based on the ability of the borrower to make payment on the loan from the cash flow of the business, and are collateralized primarily by business assets such as equipment, inventory and accounts receivable. These assets are often subject to depreciation over time, may be more difficult than real estate collateral to evaluate, and may be more difficult to realize the value of upon foreclosure. As a result, the availability of funds for repayment of such loans is often contingent on the success of the business itself. Although we seek to structure and monitor our loans and the financial condition of our borrowers in an effort to avoid or minimize losses, unexpected reversals in the business of an individual borrower can occur, and the resulting decline in the quality of loans to such borrowers, and related provisions for credit losses, could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, financial condition and shareholder returns.\nA substantial portion of our loans are and will continue to be real estate related loans in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. Adverse changes in the real estate market or economy in this area could lead to higher levels of problem loans and charge-offs, adversely affecting our earnings and financial condition.\nWe make loans primarily to borrowers in the Washington, D.C. and Baltimore metropolitan areas, focusing on the Virginia counties of Arlington, Fairfax, Loudoun and Prince William and the independent cities located within those counties, Washington D.C., and its Maryland suburbs, and have a substantial portion of our loans secured by real estate. These concentrations expose us to the risk that adverse developments in the real estate market, or in the general economic conditions in such areas, or the continuation of such adverse developments, could increase the levels of nonperforming loans and charge-offs, and reduce loan demand and deposit growth. In that event, we would likely experience lower earnings or losses. Additionally, if economic conditions in the area deteriorate, or there is significant volatility or weakness in the economy or any significant sector of the area's economy, our ability to develop our business relationships may be diminished, the quality and collectability of our loans may be adversely affected, our provision for loan losses may increase, the value of collateral may decline and loan demand may be reduced.\nIncreases to our nonperforming assets or other problem assets will have an adverse effect on our earnings.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had nonperforming loans and loans 90 days or more past due of $10.7 million, or 0.84% of total loans, $3.9 million of other real estate owned, or OREO, and nonperforming assets of 0.95% of total assets. At that date, we had a $3.9 million loan considered a troubled debt restructuring, which is included in our nonperforming loan totals above. If any of our loans which are 90 or more days past due and still accruing become nonaccrual loans, we will not record interest income on such loans, and may be required to reverse prior accruals, thereby adversely affecting our earnings. If the level of our nonperforming or other problem assets increases, we may be required to make additional provisions for loan losses, which will negatively impact our earnings. If we are required to foreclose on any collateral properties securing our loans, we will incur legal and other expenses in connection with the foreclosure and sale process and possible losses on the sale of OREO or other collateral. Additionally, the resolution of nonperforming assets, troubled debt restructurings\nand other problem assets requires the active involvement of management, which can distract management from its overall supervision of operations and other income producing activities.\nOur concentrations of loans may create a greater risk of loan defaults and losses.\nA substantial portion of our loans are secured by various types of real estate in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area and substantially all of our loans are to borrowers in that area. At December 31, 2019, 90.1% of our total loans were secured by real estate; commercial real estate loans, excluding construction and land development, comprised the largest portion of these loans at 64.6% of our portfolio. This concentration exposes us to the risk that adverse developments in the real estate market, or the general economic conditions in our market, could increase our nonperforming loans and charge-offs, reduce the value of our collateral and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. Management believes that the commercial real estate concentration risk is mitigated by diversification among the types and characteristics of real estate collateral properties, sound underwriting practices, rigorous portfolio monitoring and ongoing market analysis. Construction and land development loans comprised 17.0% of total loans at December 31, 2019. Commercial and industrial loans comprised 9.0%, of total loans at December 31, 2019. These categories of loans have historically carried a higher risk of default than other types of loans, such as single family residential mortgage loans. The repayment of these loans often depends on the successful operation of a business or the sale or development of the underlying property, and, as a result, are more likely to be adversely affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy in general. While we believe that our loan portfolio is well diversified in terms of borrowers and industries, these concentrations expose us to the risk that adverse developments in the real estate market, or in the general economic conditions in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, could increase the levels of nonperforming loans and charge-offs, and reduce loan demand. In that event, we would likely experience lower earnings or losses. Additionally, if, for any reason, economic conditions in our market area deteriorate, or there is significant volatility or weakness in the economy or any significant sector of the area's economy, our ability to develop our business relationships may be diminished, the quality and collectability of our loans may be adversely affected, our provision for loan losses may increase, the value of collateral may decline and loan demand may be reduced.\nCommercial real estate loans tend to have larger balances than single family mortgage loans and other consumer loans. Because the loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances, the deterioration of one or a few of these loans may cause a significant increase in nonperforming assets. An increase in nonperforming loans could result in a loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the provision for loan losses, or an increase in loan charge-offs, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe operate in a highly competitive market and face increasing competition from a variety of traditional and new financial services providers, which could adversely impact our profitability.\nThe banking business is highly competitive. We compete as a financial intermediary with other commercial banks, savings banks, credit unions, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market mutual funds and other financial institutions operating in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area and elsewhere, as well as nontraditional competitors such as fintech companies and internet-based lenders, depositories and payment systems. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete with traditional and new financial services providers, some of which maintain a physical presence in our market areas and others of which maintain only a virtual presence.\nOur primary market area is a highly competitive, highly branched, banking market. Competition in the market area for loans to small and middle-market businesses and professionals, our target market, is intense and pricing is important. Several of our competitors have substantially greater resources and\nlending limits than us, and offer certain services, such as extensive and established branch networks and trust services, that we do not currently provide or currently expect to provide in the near future. Moreover, larger institutions operating in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area may have access to borrowed funds at lower cost than will be available to us. Additionally, deposit competition among institutions in the market area is strong. Increased competition could require us to increase the rates we pay on deposits or lower the rates that we offer on loans, which could reduce our profitability. Our failure to compete effectively in our market could restrain our growth or cause us to lose market share, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur portfolio of loans to small and mid-sized community-based businesses may increase our credit risk.\nMany of our commercial business and commercial real estate loans are made to small business or middle market customers. These businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities and have a heightened vulnerability to economic conditions. If general economic conditions in the market area in which we operate negatively impact this important customer sector, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. Moreover, a portion of these loans have been made by us in recent years and the borrowers may not have experienced a complete business or economic cycle. The deterioration of our borrowers' businesses may hinder their ability to repay their loans with us, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur government contractor customers, and businesses in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area in general, may be adversely impacted by the federal government and a budget impasse.\nAt December 31, 2019, 9.0% of our total loans were outstanding to commercial and industrial customers. Of that, approximately 28.8% of outstanding commercial and industrial loans are to government contractors or their subcontractors specializing in the defense and homeland security and defense readiness sectors, and we have commitments of $131.6 million to such borrowers. We are actively seeking to expand our exposure to this business segment. While we believe that our loans to government contractor customers are unlikely to experience more than a delay in payment as a result of government shutdowns, the current emphasis on defense readiness presents an opportunity for many of our customers. In the event of a government shutdown, this could cause these customers to have their government contracts reduced or terminated for convenience, or have payments delayed, causing a loss of anticipated revenues or reduced cash flow, resulting in an increase in credit risk, and potentially defaults by such customers on their respective loans.\nOur government contractor customers could also withdraw their deposit balances during a shutdown to fund current operations, resulting in additional liquidity risk. Additionally, temporary layoffs, salary reductions or furloughs of government employees or government contractors could have adverse impacts on other businesses in our market and the general economy of the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, and may indirectly lead to a loss of revenues by our customers. As a result, a government shutdown could lead to an increase in the levels of past due loans, nonperforming loans, loan loss reserves and charge-offs, and a decline in liquidity.\nWe may not be able to retain or grow our core deposit base, which could adversely impact our funding costs.\nLike many financial institutions, we rely on customer deposits as our primary source of funding for our lending activities, and we continue to seek customer deposits to maintain this funding base. Our future growth will largely depend on our ability to retain and grow our deposit base. As of December 31, 2019, we had $1.29 billion in deposits. Our deposits are subject to potentially dramatic fluctuations in availability or price due to certain factors outside of our control, such as increasing competitive pressures for deposits, changes in interest rates and returns on other investment classes,\ncustomer perceptions of our financial health and general reputation, adverse developments in general economic conditions of an individual's business, and a loss of confidence by customers in us or the banking sector generally, which could result in significant outflows of deposits within short periods of time or significant changes in pricing necessary to maintain current customer deposits or attract additional deposits. Any such loss of funds could result in lower loan originations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLiquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and meet our obligations as they become due, and failure to maintain sufficient liquidity could materially adversely affect our growth, business, profitability and financial condition.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. Liquidity risk is the potential that we will be unable to meet our obligations as they become due because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and without adverse conditions or consequences. We require sufficient liquidity to fund asset growth, meet customer loan requests, customer deposit maturities and withdrawals, payments on our debt obligations as they come due and other cash commitments under both normal operating conditions and other unpredictable circumstances, including events causing industry or general financial market stress. Liquidity risk can increase due to a number of factors, including an over-reliance on a particular source of funding or market-wide phenomena such as market dislocation and major disasters. Factors that could detrimentally impact access to liquidity sources include, but are not limited to, a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in our market, adverse regulatory actions against us, or changes in the liquidity needs of our depositors. Market conditions or other events could also negatively affect the level or cost of funding, affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet contractual obligations, and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner, and without adverse consequences. Our inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans, and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our business, and could result in the closure of the Bank. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on acceptable terms could be impaired by factors that affect our organization specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general. Any substantial, unexpected, and/or prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could impair our ability to fund operations and meet our obligations as they become due and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on customer deposits, including brokered deposits, and to a lesser extent on advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta, or FHLB, to fund our operations. Although we have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances if desired, we may not be able to replace such funds in the future if our financial condition, the financial condition of the FHLB or market conditions were to change. FHLB borrowings and other current sources of liquidity may not be available or, if available, sufficient to provide adequate funding for operations.\nOur reputation is critical to our business, and damage to it could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe believe that a key differentiating factor for our business is the strong reputation we have built in our market. Maintaining a positive reputation is critical to attracting and retaining customers and employees. Adverse perceptions of us could make it more difficult for us to execute on our strategy. Harm to our reputation can arise from many sources, including actual or perceived employee misconduct, errors or misconduct by our third party vendors or other counterparties, litigation or regulatory actions, our failure to meet our high customer service and quality standards, compliance failures and weakened financial condition. Negative publicity about us, whether or not accurate, may damage our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur allowance for loan losses may be inadequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nExperience in the banking industry indicates that a portion of our loans will become delinquent, and that some may only be partially repaid or may never be repaid at all. We may experience losses for reasons beyond our control, such as the impact of general economic conditions on customers and their businesses. In determining the size of our allowance for loan losses, we rely on an analysis of our loan portfolio considering historical loss experience, volume and types of loans, trends in classification, volume and trends in delinquencies and nonaccruals, economic conditions and other pertinent information. Although we endeavor to maintain our allowance for loan losses at a level adequate to absorb any inherent losses in the loan portfolio, the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses is inherently highly subjective and requires us to make significant estimates of and assumptions regarding current credit risk and future trends, and the accuracy of our judgments depends on the outcome of future events. Further, despite our underwriting criteria and historical experience, we may be particularly susceptible to losses due to: (i) the geographic concentration of our loans, (ii) the concentration of higher risk loans, such as commercial real estate, and commercial and industrial loans, and (iii) the relative lack of seasoning of certain of our loans.\nDeterioration of economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, inaccurate management assumptions, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may result in our experiencing higher levels of nonperforming assets and charge-offs, and incurring loan losses in excess of our current allowance for loan losses, requiring us to make material additions to our allowance for loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur federal and state banking regulators, as an integral part of their supervisory function, periodically review the allowance for loan losses. These regulatory agencies may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or to recognize further loan charge-offs based upon their judgments, which may be different from ours. If we need to make significant and unanticipated increases in the loss allowance in the future, or to take additional charge-offs for which we have not established adequate reserves, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected at that time.\nThe success of our growth strategy depends, in part, on our ability to identify and retain individuals with experience and relationships in our market.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our management team and key employees. The loss of any of our management team or our key employees could materially adversely affect our ability to execute our business strategy, and we may not be able to find adequate replacements on a timely basis, or at all. We cannot ensure that we will be able to retain the services of any members of our management team or other key employees. Failure to attract and retain a qualified management team and qualified key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn order to continue to grow successfully, we must also identify and retain experienced loan officers with local expertise and relationships. We expect that competition for experienced loan officers will continue to be intense and that there will be a limited number of qualified loan officers with knowledge of, and experience in, the community banking industry in our market area. Even if we identify individuals that we believe could assist us in building our franchise, we may be unable to recruit these individuals away from their current banks. In addition, the process of identifying and recruiting loan officers with the combination of skills and attributes required to carry out our strategy is often lengthy. Our inability to identify, recruit and retain talented personnel could limit our growth and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The lack of acquisition\nopportunities in the future, or our inability to successfully bid for such opportunities as are available, could result in a slower pace of growth.\nWe may not be able to successfully manage continued growth.\nAs our capital base grows, so does our legal lending limit. We cannot be certain as to our ability to manage increased levels of assets and liabilities, or to successfully make and supervise higher balance loans. Further, we may not be able to maintain the relatively low number and level of nonperforming loans and charge-offs that we have experienced. We may be required to make additional investments in equipment, software, physical facilities and personnel to accumulate and manage higher asset levels and loan balances, which may adversely impact earnings, shareholder returns, and our efficiency ratio. Increases in operating expenses or nonperforming assets may have an adverse impact on the value of our common stock.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to grow and to remain profitable in future periods, or, if profitable, that our overall earnings will remain consistent with our prior results of operations, or increase in the future. A downturn in economic conditions in our market, particularly in the real estate market, heightened competition from other financial services providers, an inability to retain or grow our core deposit base, regulatory and legislative considerations, a failure to maintain adequate internal controls and compliance processes, and failure to attract and retain high-performing talent, among other factors, could limit our ability to grow assets, or increase profitability, as rapidly as we have in the past. Sustainable growth requires that we manage our risks by following prudent loan underwriting standards, balancing loan and deposit growth without materially increasing interest rate risk or compressing our net interest margin, maintaining more than adequate capital at all times, hiring and retaining qualified employees and successfully implementing our strategic initiatives. Our failure to sustain our historical rate of growth or adequately manage the factors that have contributed to our growth could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and profitability and therefore on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulatory requirements affecting our loans secured by commercial real estate could limit our ability to leverage our capital and adversely affect our growth and profitability.\nThe federal banking agencies have issued guidance governing financial institutions that have concentrations in commercial real estate lending. The guidance provides that institutions which have (i) total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land loans which represent 100% or more of an institution's total risk-based capital; or (ii) total reported commercial real estate loans, excluding loans secured by owner-occupied commercial real estate, representing 300% or more of the institution's total risk-based capital, where the institution's commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50% or more during the prior 36 months, are identified as having potential commercial real estate concentration risk. Institutions which are deemed to have concentrations in commercial real estate lending are expected to employ heightened levels of risk management with respect to their commercial real estate portfolios, and may be required to hold higher levels of capital. We have a concentration in commercial real estate loans, and we have experienced significant growth in our commercial real estate portfolio in recent years. As of December 31, 2019, commercial real estate loans, as defined for regulatory purposes, represented 396.4% of our total risk-based capital. Of those loans, commercial construction, development and land loans represented 111.7% of our total risk based capital. Owner-occupied commercial real estate loans represented an additional 107.0% of our total risk based capital. Management has extensive experience in commercial real estate lending, and has implemented and continues to maintain heightened portfolio monitoring and reporting, and strong underwriting criteria with respect to its commercial real estate portfolio. Nevertheless, we could be required to maintain higher levels of capital as a result of our commercial real estate concentration,\nwhich could limit our growth, require us to obtain additional capital, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLack of seasoning of our loan portfolio could increase risk of credit defaults in the future.\nAs a result of our organic growth over the past several years, as of December 31, 2019, approximately $1.02 billion, or 79.9%, of the loans in our loan portfolio were first originated during the past three years. The average age by loan type for loans originated in the past three years is: commercial real estate loans-1.55 years; commercial and industrial loans-1.35 years; commercial construction loans-0.91 years; consumer residential loans-1.38 years; and consumer nonresidential loans-1.64 years. In general, loans do not begin to show signs of credit deterioration or default until they have been outstanding for some period of time, a process referred to as \"seasoning.\" As a result, a portfolio of older loans will usually behave more predictably than a newer portfolio. Therefore, the recent and current level of delinquencies and defaults may not represent the level that may prevail as the portfolio becomes more seasoned and may not serve as a reliable basis for predicting the health and nature of our loan portfolio, including net charge-offs and the ratio of nonperforming assets in the future. Our limited experience with these loans may not provide us with a significant history with which to judge future collectability or performance. However, we believe that our stringent credit underwriting process, our ongoing credit review processes, and our history of successful management of our loan portfolio, mitigate these risks. Nevertheless, if delinquencies and defaults increase, we may be required to increase our provision for loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLimits on our ability to use brokered deposits as part of our funding strategy may adversely affect our ability to grow.\nA \"brokered deposit\" is any deposit that is obtained from, or through the mediation or assistance of, a deposit broker. These deposit brokers attract deposits from individuals and companies throughout the country and internationally whose deposit decisions are based almost exclusively on obtaining the highest interest rates. Recently enacted legislation excludes reciprocal deposits of up to the lesser of $5 billion or 20% of an institution's deposits from the definition of brokered deposits, where the institution is well capitalized and has a composite supervisory rating of 1 or 2. We have used brokered deposits in the past, and we intend to continue to use brokered deposits as one of our funding sources to support future growth. We have established a brokered deposit to total deposit tolerance ratio of 15%. As of December 31, 2019, brokered deposits, excluding reciprocal deposits, represented approximately 7.8% of our total deposits. Reciprocal deposits represented an additional 5.6% of total deposits at December 31, 2019. Currently, our brokered deposits have a comparable deposit cost to our core deposits. There are risks associated with using brokered deposits. In order to continue to maintain our level of brokered deposits, we may be forced to pay higher interest rates than those contemplated by our asset-liability pricing strategy which could have an adverse effect on our net interest margin. In addition, banks that become less than \"well capitalized\" under applicable regulatory capital requirements may be restricted in their ability to accept or renew, or prohibited from accepting or renewing, brokered deposits. If this funding source becomes more difficult to access, we will have to seek alternative funding sources in order to continue to fund our growth. This may include increasing our reliance on FHLB borrowings, attempting to attract additional non-brokered deposits, and selling loans. There can be no assurance that brokered deposits will be available, or if available, sufficient to support our continued growth. The unavailability of a sufficient volume of brokered deposits could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may face risks with respect to future expansion or acquisition activity.\nWe selectively seek to expand our banking operations through limited de novo branching or opportunistic acquisition activities. We cannot be certain that any expansion activity, through de novo branching, acquisition of branches of another financial institution or a whole institution, or the establishment or acquisition of nonbanking financial service companies, will prove profitable or will increase shareholder value. The success of any acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the estimated cost savings and revenue enhancements from combining our business and that of the target company. Our ability to realize increases in revenue will depend, in part, on our ability to retain customers and employees, and to capitalize on existing relationships for the provision of additional products and services. If our estimates turn out to be incorrect or we are not able to successfully combine companies, the anticipated cost savings and increased revenues may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of each company's ongoing business, diversion of management attention, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger. As with any combination of banking institutions, there also may be disruptions that cause us to lose customers or cause customers to withdraw their deposits. Customers may not readily accept changes to their banking arrangements that we make as part of or following an acquisition. Additionally, the value of an acquisition to us is dependent on our ability to successfully identify and estimate the magnitude of any asset quality issues of acquired companies.\nWe may not be successful in overcoming these risks or other problems encountered in connection with potential acquisitions or other expansion activity. Our inability to overcome these risks could have an adverse effect on our ability to implement our business strategy and enhance shareholder value, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAdditionally, at December 31, 2019, we had $7.1 million of goodwill related to our acquisition of Colombo. Goodwill and other intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis or when facts and circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Our financial condition and results of operation may be adversely affected if that goodwill is determined to be impaired, which would require us to take an impairment charge.\nWe have extended off-balance sheet commitments to borrowers which expose us to credit and interest rate risk.\nWe enter into off-balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. These off-balance sheet arrangements include commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and guarantees which would impact our liquidity and capital resources to the extent customers accept or use these commitments. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. Our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit and guarantees written is represented by the contractual or notional amount of those instruments. We use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on-balance sheet instruments.\nNew lines of business, products, product enhancements or services may subject us to additional risk.\nFrom time to time, we may implement new lines of business or offer new products and product enhancements as well as new services within our existing lines of business. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts. In developing, implementing or marketing new lines of business, products, product enhancements or services, we may invest significant time and resources. We\nmay underestimate the appropriate level of resources or expertise necessary to make new lines of business or products successful or to realize their expected benefits. We may not achieve the milestones set in initial timetables for the development and introduction of new lines of business, products, product enhancements or services, and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences, may also impact the ultimate implementation of a new line of business or offerings of new products, product enhancements or services. Any new line of business, product, product enhancement or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. We may also decide to discontinue businesses or products, due to lack of customer acceptance or unprofitability. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or offerings of new products, product enhancements or services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on the accuracy and completeness of information provided by customers and counterparties.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and counterparties, we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial information. We may also rely on representations of customers and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. In deciding whether to extend credit, we may rely upon customers' representations that their financial statements conform to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, or GAAP, and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the customer. We also may rely on customer representations and certifications, or audit or accountants' reports, with respect to the business and financial condition of our customers. Our financial condition, results of operations, financial reporting and reputation could be negatively affected if we rely on materially misleading, false, inaccurate or fraudulent information.\nWe depend on information technology and telecommunications systems of third parties, and any systems failures or interruptions could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nOur business depends on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems. We outsource many of our major systems, such as data processing, deposit processing, loan origination, email and anti-money laundering monitoring systems. Of particular significance is our long-term contract for core data processing services with Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations, and we could experience difficulty in implementing replacement solutions. In many cases, our operations rely heavily on secured processing, storage and transmission of information and the monitoring of a large number of transactions on a minute-by-minute basis, and even a short interruption in service could have significant consequences. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third party systems fail or experience interruptions. If significant, sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business and subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, failure of third parties to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or fraud or misconduct on the part of employees of any of these third parties, could disrupt our operations or adversely affect our reputation.\nWe are subject to cybersecurity risks and security breaches and may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks and to respond to cyber incidents, and we may experience harm to our reputation and liability exposure from security breaches.\nOur business involves the storage and transmission of customers' proprietary information and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation and potential liability. While we have incurred no material cyber-attacks or security breaches to date, a number of other financial services and other companies have disclosed cyber-attacks and security breaches, some of which have involved intentional attacks. Attacks may be targeted at us, our customers or both. Although we devote significant resources to maintain, regularly update and backup our systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of our computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets and the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information belonging to us or our customers, our security measures may not be effective against all potential cyber-attacks or security breaches. Despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, it is possible that we may not be able to anticipate, or implement effective preventive measures against, all security breaches of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because cyber-attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including persons who are involved with organized crime or associated with external service providers or who may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. These risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our internet-based product offerings and expand our internal usage of web-based products and applications. If an actual or perceived security breach occurs, customer perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and could result in the loss of customers.\nA successful penetration or circumvention of the security of our systems, including those of third party providers or other financial institutions, or the failure to meet regulatory requirements for security of our systems, could cause serious negative consequences, including significant disruption of our operations, misappropriation of our confidential information or that of our customers, or damage to our computers or systems or those of our customers or counterparties, significant increases in compliance costs (such as repairing systems or adding new personnel or protection technologies), and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to us or to our customers, loss of confidence in our security measures, customer dissatisfaction, significant litigation and regulatory exposure, and harm to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to keep up with the rapid technological changes in the financial services industry could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position and profitability.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and reduce costs. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements than we have. We may not be able to implement new technology-driven products and services effectively or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could harm our ability to compete effectively and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. As these technologies are improved in the future, we may be required to make significant capital expenditures in order to remain competitive, which may increase our overall expenses and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risks and/or losses to us.\nOur risk management framework is comprised of various processes, systems and strategies, and is designed to manage the types of risk to which we are subject, including, among others, credit, market, liquidity, interest rate and compliance. Our framework also includes financial or other modeling methodologies that involve management assumptions and judgment. Our risk management framework may not be effective under all circumstances and may not adequately mitigate any risk or loss to us. If our risk management framework is not effective, we could suffer unexpected losses and our business, financial condition, results of operations or growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected. We may also be subject to potentially adverse regulatory consequences.\nWe may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services companies are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services companies, or the financial services industry generally, could lead to market-wide liquidity problems and losses or defaults by us or other institutions. These losses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to design and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable reports and prevent fraud.\nWe believe that a control system, no matter how well designed and managed, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. We may not be able to identify all significant deficiencies and/or material weaknesses in our internal control system in the future, and our failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and FDIC regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on the use of data and modeling in both our management's decision-making generally and in meeting regulatory expectations in particular.\nThe use of statistical and quantitative models and other quantitatively-based analyses is endemic to bank decision-making and regulatory compliance processes, and the employment of such analyses is becoming increasingly widespread in our operations. Liquidity stress testing, interest rate sensitivity analysis, allowance for loan loss measurement, portfolio stress testing and the identification of possible violations of anti-money laundering regulations are examples of areas in which we are dependent on models and the data that underlies them. We anticipate that model-derived insights will be used more widely in our decision-making in the future. While these quantitative techniques and approaches improve our decision-making, they also create the possibility that faulty data or flawed quantitative approaches could yield adverse outcomes or regulatory scrutiny. Secondarily, because of the complexity inherent in these approaches, misunderstanding or misuse of their outputs could similarly result in suboptimal decision making, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future, and we may not be able to do so.\nAccess to sufficient capital is critical in order to enable us to implement our business plan, support our business, expand our operations and meet applicable capital requirements. The inability to have sufficient capital, whether internally generated through earnings or raised in the capital markets, could adversely impact our ability to support and to grow our operations. If we grow our operations faster than we generate capital internally, we will need to access the capital markets. We may not be able to raise additional capital in the form of additional debt or equity on acceptable terms, or at all. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on, among other things, conditions in the capital markets at that time, our financial condition and our results of operations. Economic conditions and a loss of confidence in financial institutions may increase our cost of capital and limit access to some sources of capital. Further, if we need to raise capital in the future, we may have to do so when many other financial institutions are also seeking to raise capital and would then have to compete with those institutions for investors. An inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could be subject to environmental risks and associated costs on our foreclosed real estate assets.\nA substantial portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing loans. There is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties and that we could be liable for remediation costs, as well as personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property's value or limit our ability to sell the affected property. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLitigation and regulatory actions, including possible enforcement actions, could subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments or other requirements resulting in increased expenses or restrictions on our business activities.\nIn the normal course of business, from time to time, we may be named as a defendant in various legal actions, arising in connection with our current and/or prior business activities. Legal actions could include claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. Further, we may in the future be subject to consent orders or other formal or informal enforcement agreements with our regulators. We may also, from time to time, be the subject of subpoenas, requests for information, reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental agencies regarding our current and/or prior business activities. Any such legal or regulatory actions may subject us to substantial compensatory or punitive damages, significant fines, penalties, obligations to change our business practices or other requirements resulting in increased expenses, diminished income and damage to our reputation. Our involvement in any such matters, whether tangential or otherwise, and even if the matters are ultimately determined in our favor, could also cause significant harm to our reputation and divert management attention from the operation of our business. Further, any settlement, consent order, other enforcement agreement or adverse judgment in connection with any formal or informal proceeding or investigation by government agencies may result in litigation, investigations or proceedings as other litigants and government agencies begin independent reviews of the same activities. As a result, the outcome of legal and regulatory actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe appraisals and other valuation techniques we use in evaluating and monitoring loans secured by real property and other real estate owned may not accurately reflect the net value of the asset.\nIn considering whether to make a loan secured by real property, we generally require an appraisal of the property. However, an appraisal is only an estimate of the value of the property at the time the appraisal is made, and, as real estate values may change significantly in value in relatively short periods of time (especially in periods of heightened economic uncertainty), this estimate may not accurately reflect the net value of the collateral after the loan is made. As a result, we may not be able to realize the full amount of any remaining indebtedness when we foreclose on and sell the relevant property. In addition, we rely on appraisals and other valuation techniques to establish the value of OREO, that we acquire through foreclosure proceedings and to determine loan impairments. If any of these valuations are inaccurate, our financial statements may not reflect the correct value of our OREO, if any, and our allowance for loan losses may not reflect accurate loan impairments. Inaccurate valuation of OREO or inaccurate provisioning for loan losses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to an extensive body of accounting rules and best practices. Periodic changes to such rules may change the treatment and recognition of critical financial line items and affect our profitability.\nThe nature of our business makes us sensitive to the large body of accounting rules in the U.S. From time to time, the governing bodies that oversee changes to accounting rules and reporting requirements may release new guidance for the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some instances, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in the restatement of prior period financial statements. Changes which have been approved for future implementation, or which are currently proposed or expected to be proposed or adopted include requirements that we: calculate the allowance for loan losses on the basis of the current expected credit losses over the lifetime of our loans, referred to as the CECL model, which is expected to be applicable to us beginning in 2023. These changes could adversely affect our capital, regulatory capital ratios, ability to make larger loans, earnings and performance metrics. Any such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnder the CECL model, banks will be required to present certain financial assets carried at amortized cost, such as loans held for investment and held-to-maturity debt securities, at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is to be based on information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. This measurement will take place at the time the financial asset is first added to the balance sheet and periodically thereafter. This differs significantly from the \"incurred loss\" model required under current GAAP, which delays recognition until it is probable a loss has been incurred. Accordingly, we expect that the adoption of the CECL model will materially affect how we determine our allowance for loan losses, and could require us to significantly increase our allowance. Moreover, the CECL model may create more volatility in the level of the allowance for loan losses. If we are required to materially increase the level of the allowance for loan losses for any reason, such increase could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are evaluating the impact the CECL accounting model will have on our accounting, but expect to recognize a one-time cumulative-effect adjustment to the allowance for loan losses as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the new standard is effective. We cannot yet determine the magnitude of any such one-time cumulative adjustment or of the overall impact of the new standard on our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe fair value of our investment securities can fluctuate due to factors outside of our control.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the fair value of our investment securities portfolio was approximately $141.6 million. Factors beyond our control can significantly influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio and can cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of these securities. These factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency actions in respect of the securities, defaults by the issuer or with respect to the underlying securities, and changes in market interest rates and instability in the capital markets. Any of these factors, among others, could cause other-than-temporary impairments, or OTTI, and realized and/or unrealized losses in future periods and declines in other comprehensive income, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. The process for determining whether impairment of a security is OTTI usually requires complex, subjective judgments about the future financial performance and liquidity of the issuer, any collateral underlying the security and our intent and ability to hold the security for a sufficient period of time to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value, in order to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security. Our failure to correctly and timely assess any impairments or losses with respect to our securities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have no current plans to pay cash dividends.\nHolders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. The Bank is our primary operating business and the source of substantially all of our earnings, and our ability to pay dividends will be subject to the earnings, capital levels, capital needs and limitations relating to the payment of dividends by the Bank to us. The amount of dividends that a bank may pay is limited by state and federal laws and regulations. While we have sufficient retained earnings and expect our future earnings to be sufficient to pay cash dividends, our board of directors currently intends to retain earnings for the purpose of financing growth. In addition, we are a bank holding company, and our ability to declare and pay dividends to our shareholders is dependent on federal regulatory considerations, including the guidelines of the Federal Reserve regarding capital adequacy and dividends. It is the policy of the Federal Reserve that bank holding companies should generally pay dividends on common stock only out of earnings, and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization's expected future needs, asset quality and financial condition.\nUncertainty relating to the discontinuation, reform or replacement of LIBOR may adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee, or ARRC, has proposed that the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, as the rate that represents best practice as the alternative to USD-LIBOR for use in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to USD-LIBOR. ARRC has proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR from USD-LIBOR and organizations are currently working on industry wide and company specific transition plans as it relates to derivatives and cash markets exposed to USD-LIBOR. The Company has material contracts that are indexed to USD-LIBOR and is monitoring this activity and evaluating the related risks.\nThe inability to obtain LIBOR rates, and the uncertainty as to the nature, comparability and utility of alternative reference rates which have been or may be established may adversely affect the value of LIBOR-based loans, investment securities and other financial instruments in our portfolio, and may impact the availability and cost of hedging instruments and borrowings. If LIBOR rates are no longer available, and the Bank is required to implement substitute indices for the calculation of interest rates under its loan agreements, it may incur additional expenses in effecting the transition, and may be\nsubject to disputes or litigation with customers over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the substitute indices, which could have an adverse effect on its results of operations. At this time, it is not possible to predict the effect that these developments, any discontinuance, modification or other reforms to LIBOR or any other reference rate, the establishment of alternative reference rates, or the impact of any such events on contractual mechanisms may have on the markets, us or our fixed-to-floating rate debt securities. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential discontinuance, modification, alternative reference rates or other reforms may negatively impact market liquidity, our access to funding required to operate our business and the trading market for our fixed-to-floating rate debt securities. Furthermore, the use of alternative reference rates or other reforms could cause the interest payable on our outstanding fixed-to-floating rate debt securities to be materially different, and potentially higher, than expected.\nThe effects of widespread public health emergencies may negatively affect our local economies or disrupt our operations, which would have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nWidespread health emergencies, such as the recent coronavirus outbreak, can disrupt our operations through their impact on our employees, customers and their businesses, and the communities in which we operate. Disruptions to our customers could result in increased risk of delinquencies, defaults, foreclosures and losses on our loans, negatively impact regional economic conditions, result in a decline in local loan demand, loan originations and deposit availability and negatively impact the implementation of our growth strategy. Any one or more of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nOur industry is highly regulated, and the regulatory framework, together with any future legislative or regulatory changes, may have a materially adverse effect on our operations.\nThe banking industry is highly regulated and supervised under both federal and state laws and regulations that are intended primarily for the protection of depositors, customers, the public, the banking system as a whole or the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund, not for the protection of our shareholders and creditors. We are subject to regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve, and our Bank is subject to regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve and the VBFI. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be difficult and costly, and changes to laws and regulations can impose additional compliance costs. The Dodd-Frank Act, which imposes significant regulatory and compliance changes on financial institutions, is an example of this type of federal regulation. The laws and regulations applicable to us govern a variety of matters, including permissible types, amounts and terms of loans and investments we may make, the maximum interest rate that may be charged, the amount of reserves we must hold against deposits we take, the types of deposits we may accept and the rates we may pay on such deposits, maintenance of adequate capital and liquidity, changes in control of us and our Bank, transactions between us and our Bank, handling of nonpublic information, restrictions on dividends and establishment of new offices. We must obtain approval from our regulators before engaging in certain activities, and there is risk that such approvals may not be granted, either in a timely manner or at all. These requirements may constrain our operations, and the adoption of new laws and changes to or repeal of existing laws may have a further impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, the burden imposed by those federal and state regulations may place banks in general, including our Bank in particular, at a competitive disadvantage compared to their non-bank competitors. Our failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations, or regulatory policies and interpretations of such laws and regulations, could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties or damage to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBank holding companies and financial institutions are extensively regulated and currently face an uncertain regulatory environment. Applicable laws, regulations, interpretations, enforcement policies and accounting principles have been subject to significant changes in recent years, and may be subject to significant future changes. Future changes may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFederal and state regulatory agencies may adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied. We cannot predict the substance or effect of pending or future legislation or regulation or the application of laws and regulations to us. Compliance with current and potential regulation, as well as regulatory scrutiny, may significantly increase our costs, impede the efficiency of our internal business processes, require us to increase our regulatory capital, and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner by requiring us to expend significant time, effort and resources to ensure compliance and respond to any regulatory inquiries or investigations.\nIn addition, regulators may elect to alter standards or the interpretation of the standards used to measure regulatory compliance or to determine the adequacy of liquidity, risk management or other operational practices for financial service companies in a manner that impacts our ability to implement our strategy and could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the regulatory agencies have extremely broad discretion in their interpretation of laws and regulations and their assessment of the quality of our loan portfolio, securities portfolio and other assets. If any regulatory agency's assessment of the quality of our assets, operations, lending practices, investment practices, capital structure or other aspects of our business differs from our assessment, we may be required to take additional charges or undertake, or refrain from taking, actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFederal and state regulators periodically examine our business and may require us to remediate adverse examination findings or may take enforcement action against us.\nThe Federal Reserve and the VBFI periodically examine our business, including our compliance with laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, the Federal Reserve or the VBFI were to determine that our financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity or other aspects of any of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or that we were in violation of any law or regulation, they may take a number of different remedial actions as they deem appropriate. These actions include the power to require us to remediate any such adverse examination findings.\nIn addition, these agencies have the power to take enforcement action against us to enjoin \"unsafe or unsound\" practices, to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation of law or regulation or unsafe or unsound practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital, to direct the sale of subsidiaries or other assets, to limit dividends and distributions, to restrict our growth, to assess civil money penalties against us or our officers or directors, to remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate our deposit insurance and place our Bank into receivership or conservatorship. Any regulatory enforcement action against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength for our Bank in times of stress.\nUnder federal law and long-standing Federal Reserve policy, we, as a bank holding company, are required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to our Bank and to commit resources\nto support the Bank if necessary. We may be required to commit additional resources to the Bank at times when we may not be in a financial position to provide such resources or when it may not be in our, or our shareholders' or creditors', best interests to do so. A requirement to provide such support is more likely during times of financial stress for us and the Bank, which may make any capital we are required to raise to provide such support more expensive than it might otherwise be. In addition, any capital loans we make to the Bank are subordinate in right of repayment to deposit liabilities of the Bank.\nRegulatory initiatives regarding bank capital requirements may require heightened capital.\nRegulatory capital rules, which implement the Basel III regulatory capital reforms from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, include a common equity Tier 1 capital requirement and establish criteria that instruments must meet to be considered common equity Tier 1 capital, additional Tier 1 capital or Tier 2 capital. These enhancements were intended to both improve the quality and increase the quantity of capital required to be held by banking organizations, and to better equip the U.S. banking system to deal with adverse economic conditions. The capital rules require banks to maintain a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5% or greater, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8% or greater, a total capital ratio of 10% or greater and a leverage ratio of 5% or greater to be deemed \"well capitalized\" for purposes of certain rules and prompt corrective action requirements. Bank holding companies and banks are also required to hold a capital conservation buffer of common equity Tier 1 capital of 2.5% to avoid limitations on capital distributions and discretionary executive compensation payments.\nThe Federal Reserve may also set higher capital requirements for holding companies whose circumstances warrant it. For example, holding companies experiencing significant internal growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible assets. Our regulatory capital ratios currently are in excess of the levels established for \"well capitalized\" institutions. Future regulatory change could impose higher capital standards.\nThe 2018 Act directed the federal banking agencies to develop a CBLR, calculated by dividing tangible equity capital by average consolidated total assets. In October 2019, the federal banking agencies adopted a CBLR of 9%. If a \"qualified community bank,\" generally a depository institution or depository institution holding company with consolidated assets of less than $10 billion, has a leverage ratio which exceeds the CBLR of 9%, then such bank will be considered to have met all generally applicable leverage and risk based capital requirements; the capital ratio requirements for \"well capitalized\" status under Section 38 of the FDIA, and any other leverage or capital requirements to which it is subject. As of December 31, 2019, we qualified for this simplified capital regime, however, there can be no assurance that satisfaction of the CBLR will provide adequate capital for our operations and growth, or an adequate cushion against increase levels of nonperforming assets or weakened economic conditions.\nAny new or revised standards adopted in the future may require us to maintain materially more capital, with common equity as a more predominant component, or manage the configuration of our assets and liabilities to comply with formulaic liquidity requirements. We may not be able to raise additional capital at all, or on terms acceptable to us. Failure to maintain capital to meet current or future regulatory requirements could have a significant material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nThe Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, the USA Patriot Act and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering\nprogram and to file reports such as suspicious activity reports and currency transaction reports. We are required to comply with these and other anti-money laundering requirements. Our federal and state banking regulators, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, and other government agencies are authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of anti-money laundering requirements. We are also subject to increased scrutiny of compliance with the regulations issued and enforced by the OFAC. If our program is deemed deficient, we could be subject to liability, including fines, civil money penalties and other regulatory actions, which may include restrictions on our business operations and our ability to pay dividends, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity, restrictions on expansion, and restrictions on entering new business lines. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have significant reputational consequences for us. Any of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to numerous \"fair and responsible banking\" laws designed to protect consumers, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions.\nThe Community Reinvestment Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations, including state laws and regulations, prohibit discriminatory lending practices by financial institutions. The Federal Trade Commission Act and the Dodd-Frank Act prohibit unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices by financial institutions. The U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, federal banking agencies, and other federal and state agencies are responsible for enforcing these fair and responsible banking laws and regulations. A challenge to an institution's compliance with fair and responsible banking laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity, restrictions on expansion and restrictions on entering new business lines. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution's performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Such actions could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to laws regarding the privacy, information security and protection of personal information and any violation of these laws or another incident involving personal, confidential or proprietary information of individuals could damage our reputation and otherwise adversely affect our business.\nOur business requires the collection and retention of large volumes of customer data, including personally identifiable information, or PII, in various information systems that we maintain and in those maintained by third party service providers. We also maintain important internal company data such as PII about our employees and information relating to our operations. We are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations governing the privacy and protection of PII of individuals (including customers, employees and other third parties). For example, our business is subject to the GLB Act, which, among other things: (i) imposes certain limitations on our ability to share nonpublic PII about our customers with nonaffiliated third parties; (ii) requires that we provide certain disclosures to customers about our information collection, sharing and security practices and afford customers the right to \"opt out\" of any information sharing by us with nonaffiliated third parties (with certain exceptions); and (iii) requires that we develop, implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing appropriate safeguards based on our size and complexity, the nature and scope of our activities, and the sensitivity of customer information we process, as well as plans for responding to data security breaches. Various federal and state banking regulators and states have also enacted data breach notification requirements with varying levels of individual, consumer, regulatory or law enforcement notification in the event of a security breach. Ensuring that our collection, use, transfer and storage of PII complies with all applicable laws and regulations can increase our costs. Furthermore, we may not be able to ensure that customers and other third parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information that they exchange\nwith us, particularly where such information is transmitted by electronic means. If personal, confidential or proprietary information of customers or others were to be mishandled or misused (in situations where, for example, such information was erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, or where such information was intercepted or otherwise compromised by third parties), we could be exposed to litigation or regulatory sanctions under privacy and data protection laws and regulations. Concerns regarding the effectiveness of our measures to safeguard PII, or even the perception that such measures are inadequate, could cause us to lose customers or potential customers and thereby reduce our revenues. Accordingly, any failure, or perceived failure, to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws and regulations may subject us to inquiries, examinations and investigations that could result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices or in significant liabilities, fines or penalties, and could damage our reputation and otherwise adversely affect our operations, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur use of third party vendors and our other ongoing third party business relationships are subject to increasing regulatory requirements and attention.\nWe regularly use third party vendors in our business and we rely on some of these vendors for critical functions including, but not limited to, our core processing function. Third party relationships are subject to increasingly demanding regulatory requirements and attention by bank regulators. We expect our regulators to hold us responsible for deficiencies in our oversight or control of our third party vendor relationships and in the performance of the parties with which we have these relationships. As a result, if our regulators conclude that we have not exercised adequate oversight and control over our third party vendors or that such vendors have not performed adequately, we could be subject to administrative penalties or fines as well as requirements for consumer remediation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRulemaking changes implemented by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will result in higher regulatory and compliance costs that may adversely affect our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act created a new, independent federal agency, the CFPB, which was granted broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws. The consumer protection provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and the examination, supervision and enforcement of those laws and implementing regulations issued by the CFPB have created a more intense and complex environment for consumer finance regulation. The ultimate impact of this heightened scrutiny is uncertain but could result in changes to pricing, practices, products and procedures. It could also result in increased costs related to regulatory oversight, supervision and examination. These changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPotential limitations on incentive compensation contained in proposed federal agency rulemaking may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain our highest performing employees.\nThe Federal Reserve, other federal banking agencies and the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, have jointly published proposed rules designed to implement provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act prohibiting incentive compensation arrangements that would encourage inappropriate risk taking at covered financial institutions, which includes a bank or bank holding company with $1 billion or more in consolidated assets. It cannot be determined at this time whether or when a final rule will be adopted and whether compliance with such a final rule will substantially affect the manner in which we structure compensation for our executives and other employees. Depending on the nature and application of the final rules, we may not be able to successfully compete with financial institutions and\nother companies that are not subject to some or all of the rules to retain and attract executives and other high performing employees.\nThe Bank's FDIC deposit insurance premiums and assessments may increase.\nThe Bank's deposits are insured by the FDIC up to legal limits and, accordingly, the Bank is subject to insurance assessments based on the Bank's average consolidated total assets less its average tangible equity. The Bank's regular assessments are determined by its risk classification, which is based on its regulatory capital levels and the level of supervisory concern that it poses. Numerous bank failures during the financial crisis and increases in the statutory deposit insurance limits increased resolution costs to the FDIC and put significant pressure on the Deposit Insurance Fund. In order to maintain a strong funding position and the reserve ratios of the Deposit Insurance Fund required by statute and FDIC estimates of projected requirements, the FDIC has the power to increase deposit insurance assessment rates and impose special assessments on all FDIC-insured financial institutions. Any future increases or special assessments could reduce our profitability and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 18115, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FVCB"}
