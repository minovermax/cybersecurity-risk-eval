{"cik": "310522", "company": "FEDERAL NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION FANNIE MAE", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-02-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRefer to \u201cMD&A-Risk Management\u201d and \u201cMD&A-Business Segments\u201d for more detailed descriptions of the primary risks to our business and how we seek to manage those risks.\nThe risks we face could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and net worth, and could cause our actual results to differ materially from our past results or the results contemplated by forward-looking statements contained in this report. However, these are not the only risks we face. In addition to the risks we discuss below, we face risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial.\nThe future of our company is uncertain.\nThere continues to be significant uncertainty regarding the future of our company, including how long the company will continue to exist in its current form, the extent of our role in the market, how long we will be in conservatorship, what form we will have and what ownership interest, if any, our current common and preferred stockholders will hold in us after the conservatorship is terminated, and whether we will continue to exist following conservatorship. The conservatorship is indefinite in duration and the timing, conditions and likelihood of our emerging from conservatorship are uncertain. Our conservatorship could terminate through a receivership. Termination of the conservatorship, other than in connection with a receivership, requires Treasury\u2019s consent under the senior preferred stock purchase agreement.\nThe previous Administration endorsed the wind down of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac through a responsible transition and the enactment of comprehensive housing finance reform legislation. The current Administration has not articulated a formal position on housing finance reform or the future of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac; however, the Secretary of the Treasury has publicly stated that he is focused on housing finance reform and a solution to the current status of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\nWe expect that Congress will continue to consider legislation that could result in significant changes in our structure and role in the future, including proposals that would result in Fannie Mae\u2019s liquidation or dissolution. Congress, FHFA or other agencies may also consider legislation or regulation aimed at increasing the competition we face, reducing our market share, expanding our obligations to provide funds to Treasury, constraining our business operations, or subjecting us to new obligations, such as the Freedom of Information Act, that could impose substantial burdens or adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. We cannot predict the prospects for the enactment, timing or final content of housing finance reform legislation or other legislation related to our activities.\nWe may not have sufficient capital reserves to avoid a net worth deficit if we experience a comprehensive loss in a future quarter. If we have a net worth deficit in a future quarter, we will be required to draw funds from Treasury to avoid being placed into receivership.\nBecause of our net worth deficit as of December 31, 2017, we had no capital reserves as of that date. Our ability to rebuild our capital reserves in future periods is limited. The dividend provisions of the senior preferred stock permit us to retain only up to $3.0 billion in future earnings as capital reserves, provided our conservator directs us to declare and pay senior preferred stock dividends in full in the future. As a result, we may not have sufficient capital reserves to avoid a net worth deficit if we have a comprehensive loss in a future quarter. And, because we had no capital reserves as of December 31, 2017, if we have a comprehensive loss in the first quarter of 2018, we will also have a net worth deficit for that quarter.\nWe have experienced and expect to continue to experience volatility in our financial results from period to period due to a number of factors, particularly changes in market conditions that result in fluctuations in the estimated fair value of the financial instruments, such as derivatives and certain securities, that we mark to market through our\nFannie Mae 2017 Form 10-K\nRisk Factors\nearnings. Other factors that may result in volatility in our quarterly financial results include developments that affect our loss reserves, such as changes in interest rates, home prices or accounting standards, or events such as natural disasters. Accordingly, although we expect to remain profitable on an annual basis for the foreseeable future, the potential volatility in our financial results, which may be significant from quarter to quarter, could result in a net worth deficit in a future quarter. In addition, other factors such as legislative or regulatory actions could result in a net worth deficit in a future quarter.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued guidance that changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments, which we will adopt on January 1, 2020. For loans, held-to-maturity debt securities and other financial assets recorded at amortized cost, entities will be required to use a new forward-looking \u201cexpected loss\u201d model that will replace today\u2019s \u201cincurred loss\u201d model and generally will result in the earlier recognition of allowance for loan losses. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements. We expect the greater impact of the guidance to relate to our accounting for credit losses for loans that are not individually impaired. The adoption of this guidance may decrease, perhaps substantially, our retained earnings and increase our allowance for loan losses, which could result in a net worth deficit when we adopt the guidance in the first quarter of 2020.\nFor any quarter for which we have a net worth deficit, we will be required to draw funds from Treasury under the senior preferred stock purchase agreement to avoid being placed into receivership. After we receive the additional funds requested from Treasury to eliminate our net worth deficit as of December 31, 2017, the maximum amount of remaining funding under the agreement will be $113.9 billion. If we were to draw additional funds from Treasury under the agreement in respect of a future period, the amount of remaining funding under the agreement would be reduced by the amount of our draw. Dividend payments we make to Treasury do not restore or increase the amount of funding available to us under the agreement. Accordingly, if we experience multiple quarters of net worth deficits, the amount of remaining funding available under the senior preferred stock purchase agreement could be significantly reduced from its current level.\nOur regulator is authorized or required to place us into receivership under specified conditions, which would result in the liquidation of our assets. Amounts recovered from the liquidation may not be sufficient to repay the liquidation preference of any series of our preferred stock or to provide any proceeds to common shareholders.\nFHFA is required to place us into receivership if the Director of FHFA makes a written determination that our assets are less than our obligations for a period of 60 days after the filing deadline for our Form 10-K or Form 10-Q with the SEC. Although Treasury committed to providing us funds in accordance with the terms of the senior preferred stock purchase agreement, if we need funding from Treasury to avoid triggering FHFA\u2019s obligation, Treasury may not be able to provide sufficient funds to us within the required 60 days if it has exhausted its borrowing authority, if there is a government shutdown, or if the funding we need exceeds the amount available to us under the agreement. In addition, we could be put into receivership at the discretion of the Director of FHFA at any time for other reasons set forth in the GSE Act, including if we are critically undercapitalized or if we are undercapitalized and have no reasonable prospect of becoming adequately capitalized.\nA receivership would terminate the conservatorship. In addition to the powers FHFA has as our conservator, the appointment of FHFA as our receiver would terminate all rights and claims that our shareholders and creditors may have against our assets or under our charter arising from their status as shareholders or creditors, except for their right to payment, resolution or other satisfaction of their claims as permitted under the GSE Act. If we are placed into receivership and do not or cannot fulfill our guaranty to the holders of our Fannie Mae MBS, there may be significant delays of any payments to our MBS holders, and the MBS holders could become unsecured creditors of ours with respect to claims made under our guaranty to the extent the mortgage collateral underlying the Fannie Mae MBS is insufficient to satisfy the claims of the MBS holders.\nIn the event of a liquidation of our assets, only after payment of the administrative expenses of the receiver and the immediately preceding conservator, the secured and unsecured claims against the company (including repaying all outstanding debt obligations), and the liquidation preference of the senior preferred stock, would any liquidation proceeds be available to repay the liquidation preference on any other series of preferred stock. Finally, only after the liquidation preference on all series of preferred stock is repaid would any liquidation proceeds be available for distribution to the holders of our common stock. We believe that in the event of a liquidation of our assets it is unlikely that there would be sufficient proceeds to make any distribution to holders of our preferred stock or common stock, other than possibly to Treasury as a holder of our senior preferred stock.\nFannie Mae 2017 Form 10-K\nRisk Factors\nOur business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected if we are unable to retain and recruit well-qualified senior executives and other employees. The conservatorship, the uncertainty of our future and limitations on our executive and employee compensation put us at a disadvantage compared to many other companies in attracting and retaining these employees.\nOur business processes are highly dependent on the talents and efforts of our senior executives and other employees. The conservatorship, the uncertainty of our future and limitations on executive and employee compensation have had, and are likely to continue to have, an adverse effect on our ability to retain and recruit well-qualified executives and other employees. Turnover in key management positions and challenges in integrating new management could harm our ability to manage our business effectively and successfully finalize the implementation of our and FHFA\u2019s current strategic initiatives, and ultimately could adversely affect our financial performance.\nActions taken by Congress, FHFA and Treasury to date, or that may be taken by them or other government agencies in the future, have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on the retention and recruitment of senior executives and other employees. We are subject to significant restrictions on the amount and type of compensation we may pay our executives and other employees under conservatorship. For example, we are subject to a law that limits the annual direct compensation of our Chief Executive Officer to no more than $600,000 while we are in conservatorship or receivership, and a law that prohibits our senior executives from receiving bonuses during any period of conservatorship. Additionally, we are unable to offer equity-based compensation to our employees. As a result of these restrictions, we have not been able to incent and reward excellent performance with compensation structures that provide upside potential to our executives, which places us at a disadvantage compared to many other companies in attracting and retaining executives. In addition, the uncertainty of potential congressional action with respect to housing finance reform, which may result in the wind-down of the company, also negatively affects our ability to retain and recruit executives and other employees.\nLimitations on our ability to offer market-based compensation also makes succession planning difficult. In particular, the limit on the annual direct compensation of our Chief Executive Officer to $600,000 significantly elevates our risk that we will not be able to retain our Chief Executive Officer and negatively affects our succession planning and our ability to attract qualified candidates for this critical role.\nWe face competition from within the financial services industry and from businesses outside of the financial services industry for qualified executives and other employees. If we are unable to retain, promote and attract executives and other employees with the necessary skills and talent, we would face increased risks for operational failures. If there were several high-level departures at approximately the same time, our ability to conduct our business would likely be materially adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business activities are significantly affected by the conservatorship and the senior preferred stock purchase agreement.\nWe are currently under the control of our conservator, FHFA, and we do not know when or how the conservatorship will terminate. As conservator, FHFA can direct us to enter into contracts or enter into contracts on our behalf, and generally has the power to transfer or sell any of our assets or liabilities. In addition, our directors do not have fiduciary duties to any person or entity except to the conservator. Accordingly, our directors are not obligated to consider the interests of the company, the holders of our equity or debt securities, or the holders of Fannie Mae MBS in making or approving a decision unless specifically directed to do so by the conservator.\nWe are subject to significant restrictions on our business activities during conservatorship. We may be prevented by our conservator from engaging in business activities or transactions that we believe would benefit our business and financial results. For example, because FHFA must approve changes to the national loan level price adjustments we charge and can direct us to make other changes to our guaranty fee pricing, our ability to address changing market conditions, pursue certain strategic objectives, or manage the mix of loans lenders choose to deliver to us is constrained. We publish national risk-based loan level price adjustment grids that specify the additional cash fees we charge at the time we acquire a loan based on the credit characteristics of the loan. These fees allow us to price appropriately for the credit risk we assume in providing our guaranty on the loans. We do not have the ability to implement changes to these pricing grids without the approval of FHFA. If the mix of our single-family loan acquisitions changes, and FHFA does not approve requested changes to our pricing grids in response to these changes, it could adversely affect our financial results and condition. In addition, if FHFA directs\nFannie Mae 2017 Form 10-K\nRisk Factors\nus to change our pricing in any manner-including increases or decreases in our base guaranty fees or our loan-level price adjustments-it could result in a decrease in our guaranty fee revenues in future periods, a decrease in our single-family business volume or a negative impact on the credit risk profile of our new single-family acquisitions, any of which could adversely affect our financial results and condition.\nBecause we are under the control of our conservator, our business objectives may not be consistent with the investment objectives of our investors. We are devoting significant resources to meeting FHFA\u2019s goals for our conservatorship and expect to continue to do so. We may be required by our conservator to engage in activities that are operationally difficult, costly to implement or unprofitable, or that may adversely affect our financial results or the credit risk profile of our book of business. FHFA has changed our business objectives significantly since we entered conservatorship, and could make additional changes at any time. Actions we take to meet FHFA\u2019s strategic goals and objectives for our conservatorship could adversely affect our financial results. For example, FHFA\u2019s conservatorship scorecards in recent years have included objectives relating to the development of a uniform mortgage-backed security for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. As the implementation date of the single security approaches, some Fannie Mae MBS and comparable Freddie Mac PCs are trading closer to or at parity. If our market share declines in the future due to this trend or other factors, it could adversely affect our financial results. It is also possible that uncertainty surrounding the implementation and overall impact of the Single Security Initiative could contribute to declines in the liquidity or market value of our Fannie Mae MBS.\nThe senior preferred stock purchase agreement with Treasury includes a number of covenants that significantly restrict our business activities. We cannot, without the prior written consent of Treasury: pay dividends (except on the senior preferred stock); sell, issue, purchase or redeem Fannie Mae equity securities; sell, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of assets in specified situations; engage in transactions with affiliates other than on arm\u2019s-length terms or in the ordinary course of business; issue subordinated debt; or incur indebtedness that would result in our aggregate indebtedness exceeding 120% of the amount of mortgage assets we are allowed to own under the agreement. In deciding whether to consent to any request for approval it receives from us under the agreement, Treasury has the right to withhold its consent for any reason and is not required by the agreement to consider any particular factors, including whether or not management believes that the transaction would benefit the company. Pursuant to the senior preferred stock purchase agreement, the maximum allowable amount of mortgage assets we were permitted to own as of December 31, 2017 was $288.4 billion and will decrease to $250 billion as of December 31, 2018. In addition, FHFA has requested that we further cap our mortgage assets each year at 90% of the annual limit under our senior preferred stock purchase agreement with Treasury.\nActions taken by the conservator and the restrictions set forth in the senior preferred stock purchase agreement could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and net worth.\nA number of lawsuits have been filed against the U.S. government relating to the senior preferred stock purchase agreement and the conservatorship. See \u201cNote 16, Commitments and Contingencies\u201d and \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d for a description of these lawsuits. These lawsuits, and actions Treasury or FHFA may take in response to these lawsuits, could have a material impact on our business.\nThe conservatorship and agreements with Treasury have had, and will continue to have, a material adverse effect on our common and preferred shareholders.\nWe do not know when or how the conservatorship will terminate. Moreover, even if we are released from conservatorship, we remain subject to the terms of the senior preferred stock purchase agreement, senior preferred stock and warrant, which can only be canceled or modified with the consent of Treasury. The conservatorship and agreements with Treasury have had, and will continue to have, material adverse effects on our common and preferred shareholders, including the following:\nNo voting rights during conservatorship. The rights and powers of our shareholders are suspended during conservatorship. During conservatorship, our common shareholders do not have the ability to elect directors or to vote on other matters unless the conservator delegates this authority to them.\nNo dividends to common or preferred shareholders, other than to Treasury. Our conservator announced in September 2008 that we would not pay any dividends on the common stock or on any series of preferred stock, other than the senior preferred stock, while we are in conservatorship. In addition, under the terms of the senior preferred stock purchase agreement, dividends may not be paid to common or preferred shareholders (other than on the senior preferred stock) without the prior written consent of Treasury, regardless of whether we are in conservatorship.\nFannie Mae 2017 Form 10-K\nRisk Factors\nOur profits are distributed to Treasury. Pursuant to the dividend provisions of the senior preferred stock and quarterly directives from our conservator, we are obligated to pay Treasury each quarter any dividends declared consisting of the amount, if any, by which our net worth as of the end of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter exceeds an applicable capital reserve amount, which is $3.0 billion effective January 1, 2018. As a result, our net income is not available to common shareholders or preferred shareholders other than Treasury as holder of the senior preferred stock.\nLiquidation preference of senior preferred stock is high and could increase. The senior preferred stock ranks prior to our common stock and all other series of our preferred stock, as well as any capital stock we issue in the future, as to both dividends and distributions upon liquidation. Accordingly, if we are liquidated, the senior preferred stock is entitled to its then-current liquidation preference (which includes any accumulated but unpaid dividends), before any distribution is made to the holders of our common stock or other preferred stock. After we receive the additional funds from Treasury to eliminate our net worth deficit as of December 31, 2017, the liquidation preference on the senior preferred stock will be $123.8 billion. The liquidation preference would increase further if we draw on Treasury\u2019s funding commitment in respect of any future quarters or if we do not pay dividends owed on the senior preferred stock. If we are liquidated, we believe it is unlikely that there would be sufficient funds remaining after payment of amounts to our creditors and to Treasury as holder of the senior preferred stock to make any distribution to holders of our common stock and other preferred stock.\nExercise of the Treasury warrant would substantially dilute investment of current shareholders. If Treasury exercises its warrant to purchase shares of our common stock equal to 79.9% of the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding on a fully diluted basis, the ownership interest in the company of our then-existing common shareholders will be substantially diluted, and we would thereafter have a controlling shareholder.\nNo longer managed for the benefit of shareholders. Because we are in conservatorship, we are no longer managed with a strategy to maximize shareholder returns.\nFor additional description of the conservatorship and our agreements with Treasury, see \u201cBusiness-Conservatorship and Treasury Agreements.\u201d\nWe may incur significant credit losses and credit-related expenses on the loans in our book of business, which could materially adversely affect our earnings, financial condition and net worth.\nWe are exposed to a significant amount of mortgage credit risk on our $3.2 trillion total book of business, which includes mortgage assets that back our guaranteed Fannie Mae MBS, mortgage assets in our retained mortgage portfolio and credit enhancements we provide. Borrowers of mortgage loans that we own or guaranty may fail to make required payments of principal and interest on their mortgage loans, exposing us to the risk of credit losses and credit-related expenses. Increases in our credit-related expenses would reduce our earnings and adversely affect our financial condition and net worth.\nThe credit performance of loans in our book of business could deteriorate in the future, particularly if we experience national or regional declines in home prices, weakening economic conditions or high unemployment, resulting in higher credit losses and credit-related expenses. Although we strengthened our underwriting and eligibility standards in late 2008 and 2009, we continue to have loans in our book of business that were originated under our prior standards. As of December 31, 2017, 10% of our single-family conventional guaranty book of business consisted of loans acquired prior to 2009 and another 13% consisted of Refi Plus loans, which represent refinancings of loans that were originated prior to June 2009. Moreover, some of the loans we acquired prior to 2009 that remain in our single-family book of business as of December 31, 2017 have certain characteristics that expose us to greater credit risk than other types of mortgage loans, such as Alt-A loans (2% of our single-family conventional guaranty book), interest-only loans (1% of our single-family conventional guaranty book) and loans with FICO credit scores at origination of less than 620 (2% of our single-family conventional guaranty book). In addition, 17% of our single-family conventional guaranty book of business as of December 31, 2017 consisted of loans with original LTV ratios greater than 90%, which may pose a higher credit risk than loans with lower LTV ratios. We present detailed information about the risk characteristics of our single-family conventional guaranty book of business and our multifamily guaranty book of business in \u201cMD&A-Business Segments.\u201d The processing of foreclosures of single-family loans continues to be slow in some states, which has negatively affected our foreclosure timelines and our single-family serious delinquency rate.\nWhile we use certain credit enhancements to mitigate some of our potential future credit losses, these credit enhancements may provide less protection than we expect for a number of reasons. Some of the credit enhancements we use, such as mortgage insurance and credit insurance risk transfer transactions, are subject to\nFannie Mae 2017 Form 10-K\nRisk Factors\nthe risk that the counterparties may not meet their obligations to us. Our credit risk transfer transactions have limited terms (typically 10 or 12.5 years), after which they provide limited or no further credit protection on the covered loans. Due to differences in accounting, there also could be a significant lag between the time when we recognize a provision for credit losses and when we recognize the related recovery from our CAS transactions. While a credit expense on a loan in a reference pool for a CAS transaction is recorded when it is probable that we have incurred a loss, for our CAS issued beginning in 2016, a recovery is recorded when an actual loss event occurs. In addition, our credit risk transfer transactions are not designed to shield us from all losses because we retain a portion of the risk of future losses on loans covered by these transactions, including all or a portion of the first loss risk in most transactions. Similarly, mortgage insurance does not protect us from all losses on covered loans. For example, mortgage insurance does not cover us from default risk for properties that suffered damages that were not covered by the hazard insurance we require. A property damaged by a flood that was outside a flood hazard area, where we require coverage, or a property damaged by an earthquake are the most likely scenarios where property damage may result in a default not covered by hazard insurance.\nA failure in our operational systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could materially adversely affect our business, impair our liquidity, cause financial losses and harm our reputation.\nShortcomings or failures in our internal processes, people, data management or systems could disrupt our business or have a material adverse effect on our risk management, liquidity, financial statement reliability, financial condition and results of operations. Such a failure could result in legislative or regulatory intervention or sanctions, liability to customers, financial losses, business disruptions and damage to our reputation. For example, our business is highly dependent on our ability to manage and process, on a daily basis, an extremely large number of transactions, many of which are highly complex, across numerous and diverse markets and in an environment in which we must adapt to changing external conditions. These transactions are subject to various legal, accounting and regulatory standards. Our financial, accounting, data processing or other operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, adversely affecting our ability to process these transactions or manage associated data with reliability and integrity. In addition, we rely on information provided by third parties in processing many of our transactions; that information may be incorrect or we may fail to properly manage or analyze it or properly monitor its data quality.\nWe rely upon business processes that are highly dependent on people, technology and equipment, data and the use of numerous complex systems and models to manage our business and produce books and records upon which our financial statements and risk reporting are prepared. This reliance increases the risk that we may be exposed to financial, reputational or other losses as a result of inadequately designed internal processes or data management architecture, inflexible technology or the failure of our systems. While we continue to enhance our technology, infrastructure, operational controls and organizational structure in order to reduce our operational risk, these actions may not be effective to manage these risks and may create additional operational risk as we execute these enhancements. In addition, our use of third-party service providers for some of our business and technology functions increases the risk that an operational failure by a third party will adversely affect us.\nOur ability to manage and aggregate data may be limited by the effectiveness of our policies, programs, processes, systems and practices that govern how data is acquired, validated, stored, protected, processed and shared. Failure to manage data effectively and to aggregate data in an accurate and timely manner may limit our ability to manage current and emerging risks, as well as to manage changing business needs.\nWe also face the risk of operational failure, termination or capacity constraints of any of the clearing agents, paying agents, exchanges, clearinghouses or other financial intermediaries we use to facilitate our securities and derivatives transactions. In recent years, there has been significant consolidation among clearing agents, exchanges and clearing houses. This consolidation and interconnectivity increases the risk of operational failure, on both an individual basis and an industry-wide basis, as disparate complex systems need to be integrated, often on an accelerated basis. Any such failure, termination or constraint could adversely affect our ability to effect transactions or manage our exposure to risk, and could have a significant adverse impact on our business, liquidity, financial condition, net worth and results of operations.\nSubstantially all of our employees and business operations functions are consolidated in two metropolitan areas: Washington, DC and Dallas, Texas. As a result of this concentration of our employees and facilities, a catastrophic event at either location, such as a terrorist attack, natural disaster, extreme weather event or disease pandemic could impact our ability to operate notwithstanding the business continuity plans and facilities that we have in\nFannie Mae 2017 Form 10-K\nRisk Factors\nplace. Although we have an out-of-region data center for disaster recovery, this data center will take several days to become operational in the event it becomes necessary as a result of the catastrophic loss of our in-region data center. Moreover, because of the concentration of our employees in the Washington, DC and Dallas metropolitan areas, if a regional disruption occurs in one of these areas, our employees may not be not able to occupy our facilities, work remotely, or communicate with or travel to other locations. Accordingly, we may not be able to successfully implement our contingency plans if a catastrophic event occurs, which could materially adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and lead to financial losses.\nA breach of the security of our systems or facilities, or those of third parties with which we do business, including as a result of cyber attacks, could damage or disrupt our business or result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential information, which could damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses.\nOur operations rely on the secure receipt, processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks and with our business partners, including proprietary, confidential or personal information that is subject to privacy laws, regulations or contractual obligations. Information security risks for large institutions like us have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies and the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct or automate financial transactions. There have been several recent, highly publicized cases involving financial services companies, consumer-based companies and other organizations reporting the unauthorized disclosure of client, customer or other confidential information, as well as cyber attacks involving the dissemination, theft and destruction of corporate information, intellectual property, cash or other valuable assets. There have also been several highly publicized cases where hackers have requested \u201cransom\u201d payments in exchange for not disclosing customer information or for not making the targets\u2019 computer systems unavailable.\nWe have been, and likely will continue to be, the target of attempted cyber attacks, computer viruses, malicious code, phishing attacks, denial of service attacks and other information security threats. To date, cyber attacks have not had a material impact on our financial condition, results or business; however, we could suffer material financial or other losses in the future and we are not able to predict the severity of these attacks. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats, the current global economic and political environment, our prominent size and scale and our role in the financial services industry, the outsourcing of some of our business operations, the ongoing shortage of qualified cyber security professionals, and the interconnectivity and interdependence of third parties to our systems.\nDespite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our software, computers, systems and information, we may not be able to anticipate, detect or recognize threats to our systems and assets, or to implement effective preventive measures against all cyber threats, especially because the techniques used are increasingly sophisticated, change frequently, are complex, and are often not recognized until launched. We routinely identify cyber threats as well as vulnerabilities in our systems and work to address them, but these efforts may be insufficient. Cyber attacks can originate from a variety of sources, including external parties who are affiliated with foreign governments or are involved with organized crime or terrorist organizations. Third parties may also attempt to induce employees, customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information or provide access to our systems or network, or to our data or that of our counterparties or borrowers, and these types of risks may be difficult to detect or prevent.\nThe occurrence of a cyber attack, breach, unauthorized access, misuse, computer virus or other malicious code or other cyber security event could jeopardize or result in the unauthorized disclosure, gathering, monitoring, misuse, corruption, loss or destruction of confidential and other information that belongs to us, our customers, our counterparties, third-party service providers or borrowers that is processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks. The occurrence of such an event could also result in damage to our software, computers or systems, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our, our customers\u2019, our counterparties\u2019 or third parties\u2019 operations. This could result in significant losses, loss of customers and business opportunities, reputational damage, litigation, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nA cyber attack could occur and persist for an extended period of time without detection. We expect that any investigation of a cyber attack would be inherently unpredictable and that it would take time before the completion of any investigation and before there is availability of full and reliable information. During such time we would not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it, and certain errors or actions could be\nFannie Mae 2017 Form 10-K\nRisk Factors\nrepeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated. In addition, announcing that a cyber attack has occurred increases the risk of additional cyber attacks, and preparing for this elevated risk can delay the announcement of a cyber attack. All or any of these challenges could further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack.\nIn addition, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures and to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures arising from operational and security risks. Although we maintain insurance coverage relating to cybersecurity risks, our insurance may not be sufficient to provide adequate loss coverage in all circumstances.\nBecause we are interconnected with and dependent on third-party vendors, exchanges, clearing houses, fiscal and paying agents, and other financial institutions, we could be adversely impacted if any of them is subject to a successful cyber attack or other information security event. For example, if a data breach compromises the integrity of borrower data that we or our customers rely on, it could adversely affect our operations or financial results. Third parties with which we do business may also be sources of cybersecurity or other technological risks. We outsource certain functions and these relationships allow for the external storage and processing of our information, as well as customer, counterparty and borrower information, including on cloud-based systems. We also share this type of information with regulatory agencies and their vendors. While we engage in actions to mitigate our exposure resulting from our information-sharing activities, ongoing threats may result in unauthorized access, loss or destruction of data or other cybersecurity incidents with increased costs and consequences to us such as those described above.\nWe routinely transmit and receive personal, confidential and proprietary information by electronic means. We have discussed and worked with customers, vendors, service providers, counterparties and other third parties to develop secure transmission capabilities and protect against cyber attacks, but we do not have, and may be unable to put in place, secure capabilities with all of our clients, vendors, service providers, counterparties and other third parties and we may not be able to ensure that these third parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information. An interception, misuse or mishandling of personal, confidential or proprietary information being sent to or received from a customer, vendor, service provider, counterparty or other third party could result in legal liability, regulatory action and reputational harm.\nOur concurrent implementation of multiple new initiatives may increase our operational risk and result in one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.\nWe are currently implementing a number of initiatives in furtherance of both our and our conservator\u2019s strategic objectives. The magnitude of the many new initiatives we are undertaking may increase our operational risk. Many of these initiatives involve significant changes to our business processes, systems and infrastructure, and present significant operational challenges for us. For example, we are working with FHFA and Freddie Mac on a multi-year effort to build a common securitization platform to eventually replace some of our current securitization infrastructure and to issue a uniform mortgage-backed security on this platform. This initiative, in coordination with related internal infrastructure upgrades, is expected to result in significant changes to our current systems and operations, and involves a high degree of complexity. While implementation of each individual initiative creates operational challenges, implementing multiple initiatives during the same time period significantly increases these challenges. Due to the operational complexity associated with these changes and the limited time periods for implementing them, we believe there is a risk that implementing these changes could result in one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in a future period. If this were to occur, we could experience material errors in our reported financial results. In addition, FHFA, Treasury, other agencies of the U.S. government or Congress may require us to take actions in the future that could further increase our operational risk.\nWe may undertake efforts that adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and net worth.\nIn conservatorship our business is no longer managed with a strategy to maximize shareholder returns while fulfilling our mission. FHFA\u2019s current strategic goals for our conservatorship are described in \u201cBusiness-Legislation and Regulation-Housing Finance Reform-Conservator Developments and Strategic Goals.\u201d In pursuit of the goals prescribed by our conservator, we are taking a variety of actions that could adversely affect our economic returns, possibly significantly, such as modifying loans to help struggling borrowers; expanding our underwriting and eligibility requirements to increase access to mortgage credit; increasing our use of credit risk transfer transactions, which effectively reduces the guaranty fee income we retain on the covered loans; and\nFannie Mae 2017 Form 10-K\nRisk Factors\npreparing to issue a uniform mortgage-backed security. We may also be asked to take additional efforts in support of our conservator\u2019s goals in the future that could adversely affect our economic returns. These activities may have short- and long-term adverse effects on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and net worth.\nOther agencies of the U.S. government or Congress also may ask us to take actions to support the housing and mortgage markets or in support of other goals. These actions may adversely affect our financial results and condition. For example, in December 2011 Congress enacted the TCCA under which, at the direction of FHFA, we increased the guaranty fee on all single-family residential mortgages delivered to us by 10 basis points effective April 1, 2012. The revenue generated by this fee increase is paid to Treasury and helps offset the cost of a two-month extension of the payroll tax cut in 2012.\nWe are also required by the GSE Act to undertake efforts in support of the housing market that could adversely affect our financial results and condition. For example, we are subject to housing goals under the GSE Act that require that a portion of the mortgage loans we acquire must be for low- and very low-income families, families in low-income census tracts and moderate-income families in minority census tracts or designated disaster areas. In addition, in December 2016, FHFA issued a final rule to implement our new duty to serve very low-, low- and moderate-income families in three underserved markets: manufactured housing, affordable housing preservation and rural areas. We are making changes to our business and our acquisitions to comply with our new duty to serve obligations, which went into effect on January 1, 2018. We may take actions to meet our housing goals and duty to serve obligations that could adversely affect our profitability. For example, we may acquire loans that offer lower expected returns on our investment than our other loan acquisitions and that may potentially increase our credit losses and credit-related expenses. If we do not meet our housing goals or duty to serve requirements, and FHFA finds that the goals or requirements were feasible, we may become subject to a housing plan that could require us to take additional steps that could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The potential penalties for failure to comply with housing plan requirements include a cease-and-desist order and civil money penalties. See \u201cBusiness-Legislation and Regulation-GSE Act and Other Regulation of Our Business\u201d for more information on our housing goals and duty to serve underserved markets.\nLimitations on our ability to access the debt capital markets could have a material adverse effect on our ability to fund our operations.\nOur ability to fund our business depends primarily on our ongoing access to the debt capital markets. Market concerns about matters such as the extent of government support for our business, the future of our business (including future profitability, future structure, regulatory actions and our status as a government-sponsored enterprise) and the creditworthiness of the U.S. government could cause a severe negative effect on our access to the unsecured debt markets, particularly for long-term debt. We believe that our ability in recent years to issue debt of varying maturities at attractive pricing resulted from federal government support of our business. As a result, we believe that our status as a government-sponsored enterprise and continued federal government support is essential to maintaining our access to debt funding. Changes or perceived changes in federal government support of our business or our status as a government-sponsored enterprise could materially and adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that the government will continue to support us, or that our current level of access to debt funding will continue. In addition, due to our reliance on the U.S. government\u2019s support, our access to debt funding also could be materially adversely affected by a change or perceived change in the creditworthiness of the U.S. government.\nFuture changes or disruptions in the financial markets could significantly change the amount, mix and cost of funds we obtain, as well as our liquidity position. If we are unable to issue both short- and long-term debt securities at attractive rates and in amounts sufficient to operate our business and meet our obligations, it likely would interfere with the operation of our business and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations, financial condition and net worth.\nOur liquidity contingency plans may be difficult or impossible to execute during a liquidity crisis.\nOur liquidity contingency plans may be difficult or impossible to execute during a liquidity crisis. If we cannot access the unsecured debt markets, our ability to repay maturing indebtedness and fund our operations could be eliminated or significantly impaired. In this event, our alternative sources of liquidity-consisting of our other investments portfolio and the unencumbered mortgage assets in our retained mortgage portfolio-may not be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs.\nFannie Mae 2017 Form 10-K\nRisk Factors\nWe believe that the amount of mortgage-related assets that we could successfully sell or borrow against in the event of a liquidity crisis or significant market disruption is substantially lower than the amount of mortgage-related assets we hold. Due to the current composition of our retained mortgage portfolio, including the significant amount of distressed assets in our portfolio, there would likely be insufficient market demand for large amounts of the mortgage-related assets in our portfolio over a prolonged period of time, which would limit our ability to borrow against or sell these assets. To the extent that we are able to obtain funding by pledging or selling mortgage-related assets as collateral, we anticipate that a discount would be applied that would reduce the value assigned to those assets. Depending on market conditions at the time, this discount could result in proceeds significantly lower than the current market value of these assets and could thereby reduce the amount of financing we obtain, which could reduce our earnings and net worth.\nA decrease in the credit ratings on our senior unsecured debt could have an adverse effect on our ability to issue debt on reasonable terms, particularly if such a decrease were not based on a similar action on the credit ratings of the U.S. government. A decrease in our credit ratings also could require that we post additional collateral for our derivatives contracts.\nA reduction in our credit ratings could materially adversely affect our liquidity, our ability to conduct our normal business operations, our financial condition and our results of operations. Credit ratings on our senior unsecured debt, as well as the credit ratings of the U.S. government, are primary factors that could affect our borrowing costs and our access to the debt capital markets. Credit ratings on our debt are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agencies. Actions by governmental entities impacting the support we receive from Treasury could adversely affect the credit ratings on our senior unsecured debt. As of December 31, 2017, our long-term debt was rated \u201cAA+\u201d by Standard & Poor\u2019s Ratings Services (\u201cS&P\u201d), \u201cAaa\u201d by Moody\u2019s Investors Services (\u201cMoody\u2019s\u201d) and \u201cAAA\u201d by Fitch Ratings Limited (\u201cFitch\u201d).\nBecause we rely on the U.S. government for capital support, in recent years, when a rating agency has taken an action relating to the U.S. government\u2019s credit rating, they have taken a similar action relating to our ratings at approximately the same time. S&P, Moody\u2019s and Fitch have all indicated that they would likely lower their ratings on the debt of Fannie Mae and certain other government-related entities if they were to lower their ratings on the U.S. government. We currently cannot predict whether one or more of these rating agencies will downgrade our debt ratings in the future, nor can we predict the potential impact.\nA reduction in our credit ratings also could cause derivatives clearing organizations or their members to demand that we post additional collateral for our derivative contracts. Our credit ratings and ratings outlook are included in \u201cMD&A-Liquidity and Capital Management-Liquidity Management-Credit Ratings.\u201d\nOne or more of our institutional counterparties may fail to fulfill their contractual obligations to us, resulting in financial losses, business disruption and decreased ability to manage risk.\nWe rely on our institutional counterparties to provide services and credit enhancements that are critical to our business. We face the risk that one or more of our institutional counterparties may fail to fulfill their contractual obligations to us. Our primary exposures to institutional counterparty risk are with credit guarantors that provide credit enhancements on the mortgage assets that we hold in our retained mortgage portfolio or that back our Fannie Mae MBS, including mortgage insurers, mortgage reinsurers and multifamily lenders with risk sharing arrangements; mortgage servicers that service the loans we hold in our retained mortgage portfolio or that back our Fannie Mae MBS; mortgage sellers and servicers that are obligated to repurchase loans from us or reimburse us for losses in certain circumstances; the financial institutions that issue the investments held in our other investments portfolio; and derivatives counterparties. We also have counterparty exposure to custodial depository institutions; mortgage originators, investors and dealers; debt security dealers; financial guarantors; and document custodians.\nIn the event of a bankruptcy or receivership of one of our counterparties, we may be required to establish our ownership rights to the assets these counterparties hold on our behalf to the satisfaction of the bankruptcy court or receiver, which could result in a delay in accessing these assets causing a decline in their value. In addition, if we are unable to replace a defaulting counterparty that performs services that are critical to our business with another counterparty, it could adversely affect our ability to conduct our operations and manage risk.\nWe routinely enter into a high volume of transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, mortgage lenders and commercial banks, and mortgage insurers, resulting in a significant credit concentration with respect to this industry. We may have multiple exposures to particular\nFannie Mae 2017 Form 10-K\nRisk Factors\ncounterparties, as many of our counterparties provide several types of services to us. For example, our lender customers or their affiliates may also act as derivatives counterparties, mortgage servicers, custodial depository institutions or document custodians. Accordingly, if one of these counterparties were to become insolvent or otherwise default on its obligations to us, it could harm our business and financial results in a variety of ways.\nAn institutional counterparty may default in its obligations to us for a number of reasons, such as changes in financial condition that affect its credit rating, changes in its servicer rating, a reduction in liquidity, operational failures or insolvency. Counterparty defaults or limitations on their ability to do business with us could result in significant financial losses or hamper our ability to do business or manage the risks to our business, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and net worth.\nWe depend on our ability to enter into derivatives transactions in order to manage the duration and prepayment risk of our retained mortgage portfolio. If we lose access to our derivatives counterparties, it could adversely affect our ability to manage these risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nOur financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected if mortgage servicers fail to perform their obligations to us.\nWe delegate the servicing of the mortgage loans in our guaranty book of business to mortgage servicers; we do not have our own servicing function. Functions performed by mortgage servicers on our behalf include collecting and delivering principal and interest payments, administering escrow accounts, monitoring and reporting delinquencies, performing default prevention activities and other functions. The inability of a mortgage servicer to perform these functions due to financial, operational, regulatory or other issues could negatively affect our ability to manage our book of business, delay or prevent our collection of amounts due to us, or otherwise result in the failure to perform other servicing duties, resulting in financial losses.\nOur servicers also have an active role in our loss mitigation efforts. Our ability to actively manage the troubled loans that we own or guarantee, and to implement our homeownership assistance and foreclosure prevention efforts quickly and effectively, is limited by our reliance on our mortgage servicers. A decline in servicer performance on loss mitigation could adversely affect our credit performance, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nA large portion of our single-family guaranty book is serviced by non-depository servicers. The potentially lower financial strength, liquidity and operational capacity of non-depository mortgage sellers and servicers compared with depository mortgage sellers and servicers may negatively affect their ability to satisfy their repurchase or compensatory fee obligations or to service the loans on our behalf.\nIf we replace a mortgage servicer, we likely would incur costs and potential increases in servicing fees and could also face operational risks. If a mortgage servicer fails, it could result in a temporary disruption in servicing and loss mitigation activities relating to the loans serviced by that mortgage servicer, particularly if there is a loss of experienced servicing personnel. We may also face challenges in transferring a large servicing portfolio.\nMultifamily mortgage servicing is typically performed by the lenders who sell the mortgages to us. We are exposed to the risk that multifamily servicers could come under financial pressure, which could potentially result in a decline in the quality of the servicing they provide us.\nWe may incur losses as a result of claims under our mortgage insurance policies not being paid in full or at all.\nWe rely heavily on mortgage insurers to provide insurance against borrower defaults on single-family conventional mortgage loans with LTV ratios over 80% at the time of acquisition. Although the financial condition of our primary mortgage insurer counterparties currently approved to write new business has improved in recent years, there is still a risk that these counterparties may fail to fulfill their obligations to pay our claims under insurance policies.\nWith respect to primary mortgage insurers that we have approved to write coverage on loans sold to us, we currently do not differentiate pricing based on counterparty strength or operational performance. Additionally, we would not revoke a primary mortgage insurer\u2019s status as an eligible insurer unless there was a material violation of our private mortgage insurer eligibility requirements. Further, we do not generally select the provider of primary mortgage insurance on a specific loan, because the selection is usually made by the lender at the time the loan is originated. Accordingly, we have limited ability to manage our concentration risk with respect to primary mortgage insurers.\nFannie Mae 2017 Form 10-K\nRisk Factors\nThree of our mortgage insurer counterparties who are currently not approved to write new business-PMI Mortgage Insurance Co. (\u201cPMI\u201d), Triad Guaranty Insurance Corporation (\u201cTriad\u201d) and Republic Mortgage Insurance Company (\u201cRMIC\u201d)-are currently in run-off. A mortgage insurer that is in run-off continues to collect renewal premiums and process claims on its existing insurance business, but no longer writes new insurance, which increases the risk that the mortgage insurer will pay claims only in part or fail to pay claims at all under existing insurance policies. Entering run-off may close off a source of profits and liquidity that may have otherwise assisted a mortgage insurer in paying claims under insurance policies, and could also cause the quality and speed of its claims processing to deteriorate. PMI and Triad have been paying only a portion of policyholder claims and deferring the remaining portion. PMI is currently paying 71.5% of claims under its mortgage insurance policies in cash and is deferring the remaining 28.5%, and Triad is currently paying 75% of claims in cash and deferring the remaining 25%. It is uncertain whether PMI or Triad will be permitted in the future to pay their deferred policyholder claims and/or increase or decrease the amount of cash they pay on claims. RMIC is no longer deferring payments on policyholder claims and has paid us its previously outstanding deferred payment obligations as well as interest on those obligations; however, RMIC remains in run-off. PMI, Triad and RMIC provided a combined $6.1 billion, or 4%, of our risk in force mortgage insurance coverage of our single-family guaranty book of business as of December 31, 2017.\nOn at least a quarterly basis, we assess our mortgage insurer counterparties\u2019 respective abilities to fulfill their obligations to us, and our loss reserves take into account this assessment. If our assessment indicates their ability to pay claims has deteriorated significantly or if our projected claim amounts have increased, it could result in an increase in our loss reserves and our credit losses.\nChanges in accounting standards and policies can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial results.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. From time to time, the FASB or the SEC changes the financial accounting and reporting standards or the policies that govern the preparation of our financial statements. In addition, FHFA provides guidance that affects our adoption or implementation of financial accounting or reporting standards. These changes can be difficult to predict and expensive to implement, and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We could be required to apply new or revised guidance retrospectively, which may result in the revision of prior period financial statements by material amounts. The implementation of new or revised accounting guidance, such as the new impairment guidance issued in June 2016 described above and in \u201cNote 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-New Accounting Guidance,\u201d could have a material adverse effect on our financial results or net worth and result in or contribute to the need for additional draws from Treasury under the senior preferred stock purchase agreement.\nMaterial weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting could result in errors in our reported results or disclosures that are not complete or accurate.\nManagement has determined that, as of the date of this filing, we have ineffective disclosure controls and procedures that result in a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has expressed an adverse opinion on our internal control over financial reporting because of the material weakness. Our ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and material weakness could result in errors in our reported results or disclosures that are not complete or accurate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nOur material weakness relates specifically to the impact of the conservatorship on our disclosure controls and procedures. Because we are under the control of FHFA, some of the information that we may need to meet our disclosure obligations may be solely within the knowledge of FHFA. As our conservator, FHFA has the power to take actions without our knowledge that could be material to our shareholders and other stakeholders, and could significantly affect our financial performance or our continued existence as an ongoing business. Because FHFA currently functions as both our regulator and our conservator, there are inherent structural limitations on our ability to design, implement, test or operate effective disclosure controls and procedures relating to information known to FHFA. As a result, we have not been able to update our disclosure controls and procedures in a manner that adequately ensures the accumulation and communication to management of information known to FHFA that is needed to meet our disclosure obligations under the federal securities laws, including disclosures affecting our financial statements. Given the structural nature of this material weakness, we do not expect to remediate this\nFannie Mae 2017 Form 10-K\nRisk Factors\nweakness while we are under conservatorship. See \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d for further discussion of management\u2019s conclusions on our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting.\nIn many cases, our accounting policies and methods, which are fundamental to how we report our financial condition and results of operations, require management to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Management also relies on models in making these estimates.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Our management must exercise judgment in applying many of these accounting policies and methods so that these policies and methods comply with GAAP and reflect management\u2019s judgment of the most appropriate manner to report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, management must select the appropriate accounting policy or method from two or more alternatives, any of which might be reasonable under the circumstances but might affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses that we report. See \u201cNote 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d for a description of our significant accounting policies.\nWe have identified two of our accounting policies as being critical to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations. These accounting policies are described in \u201cMD&A-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.\u201d We believe these policies are critical because they require management to make particularly subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions.\nBecause our financial statements involve estimates for amounts that are very large, even a small change in the estimate can have a significant impact for the reporting period. For example, because our allowance for loan losses is so large, even a change that has a small impact relative to the size of this allowance can have a meaningful impact on our results for the quarter in which we make the change.\nMany of our accounting methods involve substantial use of models. Models are inherently imperfect predictors of actual results because they are based on assumptions, including assumptions about future events. Our actual results could differ significantly from those generated by our models. As a result, the estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements, as well as our estimates of our future results of operations, may be inaccurate, perhaps significantly.\nFailure of our models to produce reliable results may adversely affect our ability to manage risk and make effective business decisions.\nWe make significant use of quantitative models to measure and monitor our risk exposures and to manage our business. For example, we use models to measure and monitor our exposures to interest rate, credit and market risks, and to forecast credit losses. The information provided by these models is used in making business decisions relating to strategies, initiatives, transactions, pricing and products.\nModels are inherently imperfect predictors of actual results because they are based on historical data and assumptions regarding factors such as future loan demand, borrower behavior, creditworthiness and home price trends. Other potential sources of inaccurate or inappropriate model results include errors in computer code, bad data, misuse of data, or use of a model for a purpose outside the scope of the model\u2019s design. Modeling often assumes that historical data or experience can be relied upon as a basis for forecasting future events, an assumption that may be especially tenuous in the face of unprecedented events.\nGiven the challenges of predicting future behavior, management judgment is used at every stage of the modeling process, from model design decisions regarding core underlying assumptions, to interpreting and applying final model output. To control for these inherent imperfections, our models are validated by an independent model risk management team within our Enterprise Risk Division and are subject to control requirements set by our model risk policies.\nWhen market conditions change quickly and in unforeseen ways, there is an increased risk that the model assumptions and data inputs for our models are not representative of the most recent market conditions. Under such circumstances, we must rely on management judgment to make adjustments or overrides to our models. A formal model update is typically an extensive process that involves basic research, testing, independent validation and production implementation. In a rapidly changing environment, it may not be possible to update existing models quickly enough to properly account for the most recently available data and events. Management\nFannie Mae 2017 Form 10-K\nRisk Factors\nadjustments to modeled results are applied within the confines of the governance structure provided by a combination of our model risk management team and our management-level finance and risk committees.\nIf our models fail to produce reliable results on an ongoing basis, we may not make appropriate risk management decisions, including decisions affecting loan purchases, management of credit losses, guaranty fee pricing, and asset and liability management. Any of these decisions could adversely affect our business, results of operations, liquidity, net worth and financial condition. Furthermore, strategies we employ to manage and govern the risks associated with our use of models may not be effective or fully reliable.\nChanges in interest rates or our loss of the ability to manage interest rate risk successfully could adversely affect our financial results and condition, and increase interest rate risk.\nWe fund our operations primarily through the issuance of debt and invest our funds primarily in mortgage-related assets that permit mortgage borrowers to prepay their mortgages at any time. These business activities expose us to market risk, which is the risk of loss resulting from changes in the economic environment. Market risk includes interest rate risk, which is the risk of loss from adverse changes in the value of our assets or liabilities or our future earnings due to changes in interest rates. We describe these risks in more detail in \u201cMD&A-Risk Management-Market Risk Management, Including Interest Rate Risk Management.\u201d Changes in interest rates affect both the value of our mortgage assets and prepayment rates on our mortgage loans.\nChanges in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and net worth. Our ability to manage interest rate risk depends on our ability to issue debt instruments with a range of maturities and other features, including call provisions, at attractive rates and to engage in derivatives transactions. We must exercise judgment in selecting the amount, type and mix of debt and derivative instruments that will most effectively manage our interest rate risk. The amount, type and mix of financial instruments that are available to us may not offset possible future changes in the spread between our borrowing costs and the interest we earn on our mortgage assets.\nWe mark to market changes in the estimated fair value of our derivatives through our earnings on a quarterly basis, but we do not similarly mark to market changes in some of the financial instruments that generate our interest rate risk exposures. As a result, changes in interest rates, particularly significant changes, can have a significant adverse effect on our earnings and net worth for the quarter in which the changes occur, depending on the nature of the changes and the derivatives we hold at that time. We have experienced significant fair value losses in some periods due to changes in interest rates, and we expect to continue to experience volatility from period to period in our financial results as a result of fair value losses or gains on our derivatives.\nChanges in interest rates also can affect our credit losses. When interest rates increase, our credit losses from loans with adjustable payment terms may increase as borrower payments increase at their reset dates, which increases the borrower\u2019s risk of default. Rising interest rates may also reduce the opportunity for these borrowers to refinance into a fixed-rate loan. Similarly, many borrowers may have additional debt obligations, such as home equity lines of credit and second liens, that also have adjustable payment terms. If a borrower\u2019s payment on his or her other debt obligations increases due to rising interest rates or a change in amortization, it increases the risk that the borrower may default on a loan we own or guarantee. In addition to increasing the risk of future borrower defaults, rising interest rates reduce expected future loan prepayments, which lengthens the expected life of our individually impaired loans and therefore increases our impairment related to concessions we have provided on those loans.\nChanges in spreads could materially impact our results of operations, net worth and the fair value of our net assets.\nSpread risk or basis risk is the resulting impact of changes in the spread between our mortgage assets and our debt and derivatives we use to hedge our position. Changes in market conditions, including changes in interest rates, liquidity, prepayment and default expectations, and the level of uncertainty in the market for a particular asset class may cause fluctuations in spreads. Changes in mortgage spreads have contributed to significant volatility in our financial results in certain periods, due to fluctuations in the estimated fair value of the financial instruments that we mark to market through our earnings, and this could occur again in a future period. Changes in mortgage spreads could cause significant fair value losses, and could adversely affect our near-term financial results and net worth. We do not actively manage or hedge our spread risk after we purchase mortgage assets, other than through asset monitoring and disposition.\nFannie Mae 2017 Form 10-K\nRisk Factors\nOur business is subject to laws and regulations that restrict our activities and operations, which limit our ability to diversify our business and may prohibit us from undertaking activities that management believes would benefit our business.\nAs a federally chartered corporation, we are subject to the limitations imposed by the Charter Act, extensive regulation, supervision and examination by FHFA and regulation by other federal agencies, including Treasury, HUD and the SEC. As a company under conservatorship, our primary regulator has management authority over us in its role as our conservator. We are also subject to other laws and regulations that affect our business, including those regarding taxation and privacy.\nThe Charter Act defines our permissible business activities. For example, we may not originate mortgage loans or purchase single-family loans in excess of the conforming loan limits, and our business is limited to the U.S. housing finance sector. In addition, as described in a previous risk factor, our business activities are subject to significant restrictions as a result of the conservatorship and the senior preferred stock purchase agreement. As a result of these limitations on our ability to diversify our operations, our financial condition and results of operations depend almost entirely on conditions in a single sector of the U.S. economy, specifically, the U.S. housing market. Weak or unstable conditions in the housing market can therefore have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and net worth.\nOur business and financial results could be materially adversely affected by legal or regulatory proceedings.\nWe are a party to various claims and other legal proceedings. We also have been, and in the future may be, involved in government investigations. We may be required to establish accruals and to make substantial payments in the event of adverse judgments or settlements of any such claims, investigations or proceedings, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and net worth. Any legal proceeding or governmental investigation, even if resolved in our favor, could result in negative publicity or cause us to incur significant legal and other expenses.\nDevelopments in, outcomes of, impacts of, and costs, expenses, settlements and judgments related to these legal proceedings and governmental investigations may differ from our expectations and exceed any amounts for which we have accrued or require adjustments to such accruals. In addition, responding to these matters could divert significant internal resources away from managing our business.\nAn active trading market in our equity securities may cease to exist, which would adversely affect the market price and liquidity of our common and preferred stock.\nOur common stock and preferred stock are now traded exclusively in the over-the-counter market. We cannot predict the actions of market makers, investors or other market participants, and can offer no assurances that the market for our securities will be stable. If there is no active trading market in our equity securities, the market price and liquidity of the securities will be adversely affected.\nMortgage fraud could result in significant financial losses and harm to our reputation.\nWe use a process of delegated underwriting in which lenders make specific representations and warranties about the characteristics of the mortgage loans we purchase and securitize. As a result, we do not independently verify most borrower information that is provided to us. This exposes us to the risk that one or more of the parties involved in a transaction (the borrower, seller, broker, appraiser, title agent, lender or servicer) will engage in fraud by misrepresenting facts about a mortgage loan. Similarly, we rely on delegated servicing of loans and use of a variety of external resources to manage our REO inventory. We have experienced financial losses resulting from mortgage fraud, including institutional fraud perpetrated by counterparties. In the future, we may experience additional financial losses or reputational damage as a result of mortgage fraud.\nFannie Mae 2017 Form 10-K\nRisk Factors\nOur business and financial results are affected by general economic conditions, particularly home prices and employment trends, and a deterioration of economic conditions or the financial markets may materially adversely affect our results of operations, net worth and financial condition.\nOur business is significantly affected by the status of the U.S. economy, particularly home prices and employment trends. A prolonged period of slow growth in the U.S. economy or any deterioration in general economic conditions or the financial markets could materially adversely affect our results of operations, net worth and financial condition. For example, if home prices decrease or the unemployment rate increases, it could result in significantly higher levels of credit losses and credit-related expense.\nGlobal economic conditions can also adversely affect our business and financial results. Changes or volatility in market conditions resulting from deterioration in or uncertainty regarding global economic conditions can adversely affect the value of our assets, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, net worth and financial condition. Global economic conditions also could negatively affect the credit performance of the loans in our book of business.\nVolatility or uncertainty in global political conditions also can significantly affect economic conditions and the financial markets. We describe above the risks to our business posed by changes in interest rates and changes in spreads. In addition, as described above, future changes or disruptions in the financial markets could significantly change the amount, mix and cost of funds we obtain, as well as our liquidity position.\nA decline in activity in the U.S. housing market, increasing interest rates, or recent changes in tax laws could lower our business volumes or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations, net worth and financial condition.\nOur business volume is affected by the rate of growth in total U.S. residential mortgage debt outstanding and the size of the U.S. residential mortgage market. A decline in mortgage debt outstanding reduces the unpaid principal balance of mortgage loans available for us to acquire, which in turn could reduce our net interest income. Even if we were able to increase our share of the secondary mortgage market, it may not be sufficient to make up for a decline in the rate of growth in mortgage originations.\nMortgage interest rates also affect our business volume. Rising interest rates generally result in fewer mortgage originations, particularly for refinances. An increase in interest rates, particularly if the increase is sudden and steep, could significantly reduce our business volume. Significant reductions in our business volume could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The Federal Reserve has raised the target range for the federal funds rate five times between December 2015 and December 2017. In January 2018, the Federal Reserve stated that it expects economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate; and that the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. The Federal Reserve also stated that the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. The Federal Reserve may increase rates at a faster rate than it is currently expecting. Moreover, the Federal Reserve\u2019s federal funds rate path is not the only factor that affects long-term interest rates. Accordingly, our business remains subject to the risk of sudden and steep interest rate increases.\nThe recent changes in tax laws may also adversely affect housing demand, home prices or other housing or mortgage market conditions, which could adversely affect our results of operations, net worth and financial condition.\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheet normalization program could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and net worth.\nIn recent years, the Federal Reserve has purchased a significant amount of mortgage-backed securities issued by us, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae. The Federal Reserve began to taper these purchases in January 2014 and concluded its asset purchase program in October 2014. From October 2014 through September 2017, the Federal Reserve maintained a policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities; therefore, it continued to purchase a significant amount of agency mortgage-backed securities. In October 2017, the Federal Reserve initiated the balance sheet normalization program the Federal Open Market Committee described in June 2017. Under this\nFannie Mae 2017 Form 10-K\nRisk Factors\nprogram, the Federal Reserve\u2019s securities holdings will be gradually reduced by decreasing reinvestment of principal payments from those securities. We expect the Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheet normalization program likely will result, in the longer term, in increases in mortgage interest rates and a widening of mortgage spreads, which could adversely affect our business volume and reduce demand for Fannie Mae MBS. If this occurs, it could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and net worth.\nRegulatory changes in the financial services industry may negatively impact our business.\nChanges in the regulation of the financial services industry are affecting and are expected to continue to affect many aspects of our business. Examples of regulatory changes that have affected us or may affect us in the future include: rules requiring the clearing of certain derivatives transactions and margin and capital rules for uncleared derivative trades, which impose additional costs on us; the CFPB\u2019s \u201cability-to-repay\u201d rule, which has limited the types of products we can acquire and could impact the volume of loans sold to us in the future; and the development of single-counterparty credit limit regulations, which could cause our customers to change their business practices.\nThe Administration and some members of Congress have indicated a desire to reduce or amend financial regulations, particularly those promulgated under specified provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Changes to financial regulations could affect our business directly or indirectly if they affect our customers and counterparties.\nChanges in regulations applicable to U.S. banks could also affect our business, as U.S. banks purchase a large amount of our debt and MBS securities. New or revised liquidity or capital requirements applicable to U.S. banks could materially affect demand by those banks for our debt securities and MBS in the future.\nThe actions of Treasury, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the SEC, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve and international central banking authorities directly or indirectly impact financial institutions\u2019 cost of funds for lending, capital-raising and investment activities, which could increase our borrowing costs or make borrowing more difficult for us. Changes in monetary policy are beyond our control and difficult to anticipate.\nOverall, these legislative and regulatory changes could affect us in substantial and unforeseeable ways and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and net worth.\nLegislative, regulatory or judicial actions could negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition or net worth.\nLegislative, regulatory or judicial actions at the federal, state or local level could negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition or net worth. Legislative, regulatory or judicial actions could affect us in a number of ways, including by imposing significant additional costs on us and diverting management attention or other resources. For example, we could be affected by:\n\u2022\nLegislative or regulatory changes that expand our or our servicers\u2019 responsibility and liability for securing, maintaining or otherwise overseeing vacant properties prior to foreclosure, which could increase our costs.\n\u2022\nState laws and court decisions granting new or expanded priority rights to homeowners associations over our mortgages, which could adversely affect our ability to recover our losses on affected loans.\n\u2022\nLegal challenges relating to MERSCORP and the MERS\u00ae System, which could negatively affect our ability to use the MERS System and adversely affect our ability to enforce our rights with respect to the large portion of our loans that are registered and tracked in the MERS System. These challenges could result in court decisions that increase the costs and time it takes to record loans or foreclose on loans.\nIn addition, as described above, our business could be materially adversely affected by legislative and regulatory actions relating to housing finance reform or the financial services industry, or by legal or regulatory proceedings.\nThe occurrence of a major natural or other disaster in the United States could negatively impact our credit losses and credit-related expenses.\nWe conduct our business in the single-family and multifamily residential mortgage markets and own or guarantee the performance of mortgage loans throughout the United States. The occurrence of a major natural or environmental disaster, terrorist attack, cyber attack, pandemic, or similar event (a \u201cmajor disruptive event\u201d) in a regional geographic area of the United States could negatively impact our credit losses and credit-related expenses in the affected area or, depending on the nature of the event, nationally.\nFannie Mae 2017 Form 10-K\nRisk Factors\nThe occurrence of a major disruptive event could negatively impact a geographic area in a number of different ways, depending on the nature of the event. A major disruptive event that either damages or destroys residential or multifamily real estate securing mortgage loans in our book of business or negatively impacts the ability of borrowers to continue to make principal and interest payments on mortgage loans in our book of business could increase our delinquency rates, default rates and average loan loss severity of our book of business in the affected region or regions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and net worth. While we attempt to create a geographically diverse book of business, a major disruptive event, depending on its magnitude, scope and nature, could generate significant credit losses and credit-related expenses.", "PERMNO": 51043, "SIC": 6111, "TIC": "FNMA"}
