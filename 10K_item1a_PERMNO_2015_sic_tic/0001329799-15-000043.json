RISK FACTORS\nMaking or continuing an investment in our securities, including our common stock and securities convertible into shares of our common stock, involves certain risks that you should carefully consider. The following are the key risk factors that affect us. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected, the market price for your securities could decline, and you could lose all or a part of your investment. Further, to the extent that any of the information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K constitutes forward-looking statements, the risk factors set forth below also are cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe are dependent upon the services of key executives and other key personnel and we could be harmed by the loss of their services.\nOur performance depends largely on the experience and client relationships of our management team and bankers and our ability to attract and retain skilled employees. Most of our executives and bankers have been involved in venture banking for much of their professional careers, primarily in providing lending or other financing services to emerging growth technology companies, life sciences companies and venture firms, and have strong relationships with individuals and institutions in the markets we serve. While we have employment agreements with certain of our executives, competition for skilled employees is intense and our bankers may terminate their employment with us at any time. We could have difficulty replacing such employees with persons who are experienced in the specialized aspects of our business or who have ties to the communities within our market areas. If we are unable to retain our employees or to replace terminating employees with other skilled people, our growth and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nBecause of the credit profile of our loan portfolio, our levels of nonperforming assets and charge-offs can be volatile. We may need to make material provisions for loan losses in any period, which could reduce net income and/or increase net losses in that period.\nOur loan portfolio has a credit profile different from that of most other banking companies. The credit profile of our clients varies across our loan portfolio, based on the nature of the lending we do for different market segments. In our portfolios for early, expansion and late stage companies, many of our loans are made to companies with modest or negative cash flows and no established record of profitable operations. Repayment of these loans may be dependent upon receipt by borrowers of additional equity financing from venture firms or others, or in some cases, a successful sale to a third party, public offering or other form of liquidity event. Due to the overall weakening of the economic environment in 2008, venture capital financing activity, as well as mergers and acquisitions and initial public offerings - activities on which venture firms rely to \u201cexit\u201d investments to realize returns - slowed in a meaningful manner. While there has been some improvement in overall economic conditions since then, particularly during the past few years, if economic conditions worsen or do not continue to improve, such activities may slow down again, which may impact the financial health of our client companies. Venture firms may continue to provide financing in a more selective manner, at lower levels, and/or on less favorable terms, any of which may have an adverse effect on our borrowers that are otherwise dependent on such financing to repay their loans to us. Moreover, collateral for many of our loans often includes intellectual property, which is difficult to value and may not be readily salable in the case of default. Because of the intense competition and rapid technological change that characterizes the companies in the technology and life science industry sectors, a borrower\u2019s financial position can deteriorate rapidly.\nWe continue to increase our efforts to lend to larger clients, as well as to make larger loans. These larger loans include loans equal to or greater than $7.5 million to individual clients, which have over time represented an increasingly larger proportion of our total loan portfolio. Increasing our loan commitments, especially for larger loans, could increase the impact on us of any single borrower default.\nWe may enter into financing arrangements with our clients, the repayment of which may be dependent on third parties\u2019 financial condition or ability to meet their payment obligations. We make loans secured by letters of credit issued by other third party banks, the repayment of which may be dependent on the reimbursement by third party banks. These third parties may not meet their financial obligations to our clients or to us, which could have an adverse impact on us. We also intend to continue to emphasize asset-based lending by providing our clients with lines of credit secured by accounts receivable and inventory. These types of loans generally expose us to additional risks since they are made on the basis of the borrower\u2019s ability to make payments from the cash flows of the borrower\u2019s business and are secured by collateral that may depreciate over time.\nIn our portfolio of venture capital clients, many of our clients have lines of credit, the repayment of which is dependent on the payment of capital calls or management fees by the underlying limited partner investors in the funds managed by these firms. These limited partner investors may face liquidity issues or have difficulties meeting their financial commitments, especially during unstable economic times, which may lead to our clients\u2019 inability to meet their repayment obligations to us.\nBased on the credit profile of our overall loan portfolio, our level of nonperforming loans, loan charge-offs and allowance for loan losses can be volatile and can vary materially from period to period. Although our average nonperforming loans and loan charge-offs have been relatively low historically, due to the credit profile of our loan portfolio and the nature of our borrowers, we may have quarterly or interim periods where nonperforming loans and charge-offs significantly exceed our historical averages. Increases in our level of nonperforming loans or loan charge-offs may require us to increase our provision for loan losses in any period, which could reduce our net income or cause net losses in that period. Additionally, such increases in our level of nonperforming loans or loan charge-offs may also have an adverse effect on our capital ratios and market perceptions of us.\nIf we conclude that the decline in value of any of our investment securities is other than temporary, we are required to write down the value of that security through a charge to earnings.\nWe review securities in our investment securities portfolio at each quarter-end reporting period for impairment due to changes in value associated with credit quality. When our other than temporary impairment (\u201cOTTI\u201d) methodology shows that an investment security has declined below its carrying value, we are required to assess whether the decline is other than temporary. Factors beyond our control can significantly influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio and can cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of these securities. For example, fixed-rate securities are generally subject to decreases in market value when market interest rates rise. Additional factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency downgrades of the securities, defaults by the issuer or individual borrowers with respect to the underlying securities, and instability in the credit markets. The process for determining whether impairment is other than temporary usually requires difficult, subjective judgments about the future financial performance of the security and any collateral underlying the security in order to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal on the security. Changes in the expected cash flows of these securities may result in our concluding in future periods that the impairment of these securities is other than temporary.\nIf we conclude through our impairment methodology that the decline is other than temporary, we are required to write down the value of that security through a charge to earnings in the quarter during which such determination is made and our capital ratios may be adversely impacted. Even if we determine that the unrealized losses associated with the investment portfolio do not require an impairment charge, increases in such unrealized losses adversely impact the tangible common equity ratio, which may adversely impact investor sentiment. A significant reduction in our capital ratios or negative investor perception may adversely impact our ability to access the capital markets or might increase our cost of capital. (See Note 3 - Investment Securities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data within this report for additional information.)\nThe valuation risk associated with our investment portfolio could have a material adverse impact on our book equity.\nAs part of managing our overall inherent risk position, our investment portfolio is typically weighted towards fixed-rate securities. If interest rates increase (decrease) the fair value of our available-for-sale investment portfolio will conversely decrease (increase). The decline in value is an unrealized loss that will decrease the fair value of our securities and the Other Comprehensive Income component of our shareholders\u2019 equity. The potential loss in book value could be quite large depending on how quickly and how materially market interest rates change. While the loss may not be permanent, due to the relatively large size of the investment portfolio the loss could have a material impact on our book value for any particular reporting period. In addition to regular interest rate risk analysis, we also conduct ongoing analysis to test Square 1 Bank\u2019s exposure to various rising rate scenarios in order to better manage this risk.\nPublic equity offerings and mergers and acquisitions involving our clients or a slowdown in venture capital investment levels may reduce the market for venture capital investment and the borrowing needs of our current and potential clients, which could adversely affect our ability to grow and our financial performance.\nOur core strategy is focused on providing banking products and services to companies, including in particular early- and expansion-stage companies that receive financial support from sophisticated investors, including venture capital or private equity firms, \u201cangels,\u201d and corporate investors. We derive a meaningful share of our deposits from these companies and provide them with loans as well as other banking products and services. In many cases, our credit decisions are based on our analysis of the likelihood that our venture capital-backed client will receive additional rounds of equity capital from investors. If the amount of capital available to such companies decreases, it is likely that the number of new clients and investor financial support to our existing borrowers could decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, profitability and growth prospects.\nWhile an active market for public equity offerings and mergers and acquisitions generally has positive implications for our business, one negative consequence is that our clients may pay off or reduce their loans with us if they complete a public equity offering, are acquired by or merge with another entity or otherwise receive a significant equity investment. Moreover, our capital call lines of credit are typically utilized by our venture capital fund clients to make investments prior to receipt of capital called from their respective limited partners. A slowdown in overall venture capital investment levels may reduce the need for our clients to borrow from our capital call lines of credit. Any significant reduction in the outstanding amounts of our loans or under our lines of credit could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe borrowing needs of our clients may be unpredictable, especially during a challenging economic environment. We may not be able to meet our unfunded credit commitments, or adequately reserve for losses associated with our unfunded credit commitments, which could have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.\nA commitment to extend credit is a formal agreement to lend funds to a client as long as there is no violation of any condition established under the agreement. The actual borrowing needs of our clients under these credit commitments have historically been lower than the contractual amount of the commitments. A significant portion of these commitments expire without being drawn upon. Because of the credit profile of our clients, we typically have a substantial amount of total unfunded credit commitments, which are not reflected on our balance sheet. Actual borrowing needs of our clients may exceed our expected funding requirements, especially during a challenging economic environment when our client companies may be more dependent on our credit commitments due to the lack of available credit elsewhere, the increasing costs of credit, or the limited availability of financings from venture firms. In addition, limited partner investors of our venture capital clients may fail to meet their underlying investment commitments due to liquidity or other financing issues, which may increase our clients\u2019 borrowing needs. Any failure to meet our unfunded credit commitments in accordance with the actual borrowing needs of our clients may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.\nAdditionally, we establish a reserve for losses associated with our unfunded credit commitments. The level of the reserve for unfunded credit commitments is determined by following a methodology similar to that used to establish our allowance for loan losses in our funded loan portfolio. The reserve is based on credit commitments outstanding, credit quality of the loan commitments, and management\u2019s estimates and judgment, and is susceptible to significant changes. There can be no assurance that our reserve for unfunded credit commitments will be adequate to provide for actual losses associated with our unfunded credit commitments. An increase in the reserve for unfunded credit commitments in any period would result in a charge to our earnings, which would reduce our net income or increase net losses in that period.\nConcentration of risk increases the potential for significant losses.\nConcentration of risk increases the potential for significant losses in our business. While there may exist a great deal of diversity within each industry, our clients are concentrated by these general industry niches: technology, life science and venture capital. Many of our client companies are concentrated by certain stages within their life cycles, such as early-stage or expansion-stage, and many of these companies are venture capital-backed. Our loan concentrations are derived from our borrowers engaging in similar activities or types of loans extended to a diverse group of borrowers that could cause those borrowers to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions. In addition, we are continuing to increase our efforts to lend to larger clients and/or to make larger loans, which may increase our concentration risk. Any adverse effect on any of our areas of concentration could have a material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Due to our concentrations, we may suffer losses even when economic and market conditions are generally favorable for our competitors.\nWe face competitive pressures that could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and future growth.\nWe compete with other banks and specialty and diversified financial services companies and venture debt funds, many of which are larger than us. While there are a limited number of direct competitors in the venture banking market, some of our competitors have long-standing relationships with venture firms and the companies that are funded by such firms. As such, the market we target is extremely competitive and several of our competitors have significantly greater resources, established customer bases, more locations and longer operating histories. Our competitors sometimes undercut the pricing and/or credit terms we are able to offer in order to increase their market share. Our pricing and credit terms could deteriorate if we act to meet these competitive challenges, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition and future growth. If we are not able to successfully compete for customers and grow our business, our profitability could be adversely affected.\nA return of recessionary conditions could result in increases in our level of nonperforming loans and/or reduce demand for our products and services, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nAlthough the U.S. economy has emerged from the severe recession that occurred in 2008 and 2009, economic growth has been slow and uneven, and unemployment levels remain high. Recovery by many businesses has been impaired by lower consumer spending. A return to prolonged deteriorating economic conditions and/or negative developments in the domestic and international credit markets could significantly affect the ability of our client companies to operate, the markets in which we do business, the value of our loans and investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability. These events may cause us to incur losses and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur allowance for loan losses is determined based upon both objective and subjective factors, and may be inadequate or subject to increase by our regulators, which could hurt our earnings.\nWhen borrowers default and do not repay the loans that we make to them, we may lose money. The allowance for loan losses is the amount estimated by management as necessary to cover probable losses in the loan portfolio at the statement of financial condition date. The allowance is established through the provision for loan losses, which is charged to income. Determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses necessarily involves a high degree of judgment. Among the material estimates required to establish the allowance are loss exposure at default, the amount and timing of future cash flows on impacted loans, value of collateral, and determination of the loss factors to be applied to the various elements of the portfolio. If our estimates and judgments regarding such matters prove to be incorrect, our allowance for loan losses might not be sufficient, and additional loan loss provisions might need to be made. Depending on the amount of such loan loss provisions, the adverse impact on our earnings could be material. In addition, we may increase the allowance because of changing economic conditions or other qualitative factors. There may be a significant increase in the number of borrowers who are unable or unwilling to repay their loans, resulting in our charging off more loans and increasing our allowance.\nIn addition, bank regulators may require us to make a provision for loan losses or otherwise recognize further loan charge-offs following their periodic review of our loan portfolio, our underwriting procedures, and our loan loss allowance. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by such regulatory authorities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Please see \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d under Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the procedures we follow in establishing our loan loss allowance.\nOur current level of interest rate spread may decline in the future. Any material reduction in our interest rate spread, or a continuation of the sustained period of low market interest rates, could have a material effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nA major portion of our net income comes from our interest rate spread, which is the difference between the interest rates paid by us on amounts used to fund assets and the interest rates and fees we receive on our interest-earning assets. We fund assets using deposits and other borrowings. While we offer interest-bearing deposit products, a majority of our deposit balances consist of noninterest-bearing products. Our interest-earning assets include outstanding loans extended to our clients and securities held in our investment portfolio. Overall, the interest rates we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities and receive on our interest-earning assets, and our level of interest rate spread, could be affected by a variety of factors, some of which are not within our control, including inflation, recession, global economic disruptions, federal government fiscal and monetary policy, changes in market interest rates, competition, regulatory requirements (such as the repeal of the interest payment restrictions under Federal Reserve Regulation Q), and a change over time in the mix of the types of loans, investment securities, deposits and other liabilities on our balance sheet.\nChanges in market interest rates, such as the Federal Funds rate, generally impact our interest rate spread. While changes in interest rates do not produce equivalent changes in the revenues earned from our interest-earning assets and the expenses associated with our interest-bearing liabilities, increases in market interest rates will nevertheless likely cause our interest rate spread to increase. Conversely, if interest rates decline and we are unable to reduce our funding costs sufficiently (due to either competitive factors or the maturity schedule of existing liabilities), our interest rate spread will decline. Sustained low levels of market interest rates could continue to place downward pressure on our net income levels. Unexpected or further interest rate changes may adversely affect our business forecasts and expectations. Any material reduction in our interest rate spread or the continuation of sustained low levels of market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See \"Interest Rate Risk-Interest Rate Risk Management\u201d under Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nWe anticipate that we will have increased operating expenses in 2015 which could adversely impact our earnings.\nAs we continue to grow our business and add employees to support our growth, we will incur additional personnel and benefits expenses related to this growth. In addition, our occupancy expenses will increase in 2015 as we continue to open new loan production offices. We anticipate that the aggregate of these increased expenses will result in an approximate increase in our operating expenses in the mid-teens for 2015 compared to 2014. Such increased operating expenses could adversely impact our net income for fiscal year 2015.\nLiquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. We and Square 1 Bank require sufficient liquidity to meet our expected, as well as unexpected, financial obligations, business needs and regulatory capital requirements. Primary liquidity resources for Square 1 Financial are dividends from the Bank and periodic capital raising transactions. We may not be able to receive dividends from\nthe Bank on a timely basis to satisfy our liquidity needs. See \u201c-We are dependent upon Square 1 Bank for cash flow, and Square 1 Bank\u2019s ability to make cash distributions is restricted.\u201d Additionally, our ability to raise additional capital depends on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, including investor perceptions regarding the banking industry, market conditions and governmental activities, and on our financial condition and performance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise additional capital if needed on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we fail to maintain sufficient liquidity, our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, and our ability to meet applicable regulatory capital requirements, would be materially and adversely affected.\nClient deposits are the primary source of liquidity for Square 1 Bank. We tend to have volatility in our deposit portfolio due to, among other things, venture capital funding and disbursement patterns and portfolio company cash burn rates. We have tools in place to manage this volatility, including varying the pricing of various deposit products and encouraging clients to use certain off-balance sheet investment products offered through our registered investment adviser subsidiary, Square 1 Asset Management, Inc. When needed, wholesale borrowing capacity supplements our liquidity in the form of short- and long-term borrowings secured by our portfolio of investment securities, loans outstanding and, finally, through unsecured overnight funding channels available to us in the Fed Funds market. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities, or on terms attractive to us, could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include, in addition to those referred to above, a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market downturn or adverse regulatory action against us, or a decrease in depositor confidence in us. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a severe volatility or disruption of the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole. Any failure to manage our liquidity effectively could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe may not pay dividends if we are not able to receive dividends from our subsidiary, Square 1 Bank.\nWe are a separate and distinct legal entity from our banking and non-banking subsidiaries, and depend on the payment of cash dividends from Square 1 Bank and our existing liquid assets as the principal sources of funds for paying operating expenses and satisfying our obligations. Such dividends would be a source of funds for us to pay cash dividends on our common stock, should we elect to pay any dividends in the future. Unless we receive dividends from Square 1 Bank or choose to use our liquid assets, we may not be able to pay our operating expenses or satisfy our obligations. Square 1 Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends is subject to its ability to earn net income and to meet certain regulatory requirements. See \u201cSupervision and Regulation-Dividend Restrictions\u201d under Item 1. Business for a discussion of regulatory and other restrictions on dividend declarations.\nOur business reputation is important and any damage to it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business plan emphasizes relationship banking. We have benefited from strong relationships with our current, former and potential clients and shareholders, the venture capital and private equity communities, and the industries that we serve. As a result, our reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business. We strive to enhance our reputation by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who share our core value of delivering superior service to our customers. If our reputation is negatively affected by legal, regulatory, supervisory or enforcement actions, matters affecting our financial reporting or compliance with Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) and exchange listing requirements, negative publicity, the actions of our employees or otherwise, our existing relationships may be damaged. We could lose some of our existing customers, including groups of large customers who have relationships with each other, and we may not be successful in attracting new customers. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. See the section captioned \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d under Item 1. Business.\nRegulation of the financial services industry is undergoing major changes, and future legislation could increase our cost of doing business or harm our competitive position.\nWe and Square 1 Bank are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors\u2019 funds, the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund and the safety and soundness of the banking system as a whole, not shareholders. These regulations affect our lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things. Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. Changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject us to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products we may offer, and/or limit the pricing we may charge on certain banking services, among other things. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) has and will continue to change the current bank regulatory structure and affect the lending, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding\ncompanies. In addition to the self-implementing provisions of the statute, the Dodd-Frank Act calls for many administrative rulemakings by various federal agencies to implement various parts of the legislation, some of which have yet to be implemented. We cannot be certain when final rules affecting us will be issued through such rulemakings and what the specific content of such rules will be. The financial reform legislation and any implementing rules that are ultimately issued could have adverse implications on the financial industry, the competitive environment, and our ability to conduct business. We will have to apply resources to ensure that we are in compliance with all applicable provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and any implementing rules, which may increase our costs of operations and adversely impact our earnings. Additionally, revised capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action rules applicable to us became effective January 1, 2015. Compliance with these rules will impose additional costs on us.\nFailure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations, there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur. See the section captioned \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d under Item 1. Business of this report for further information.\nWe are periodically subject to examination and scrutiny by a number of banking agencies and, depending upon the findings and determinations of these agencies, we may be required to make adjustments to our business that could adversely affect us.\nFederal and state banking agencies periodically conduct examinations of our business, including compliance with applicable laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, a federal banking agency was to determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, asset concentration, earnings prospects, management, liquidity, sensitivity to market risk or other aspects of any of our operations has become unsatisfactory, or that we or our management is in violation of any law or regulation, it could take a number of different remedial actions as it deems appropriate. These actions include the power to enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices, to require affirmative actions to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital, to restrict our growth, to change the asset composition of our portfolio or balance sheet, to assess civil monetary penalties against our officers or directors, to remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate our deposit insurance. If we become subject to such regulatory actions, our business, results of operations and reputation may be negatively impacted.\nWe are dependent upon Square 1 Bank for cash flow, and Square 1 Bank\u2019s ability to make cash distributions is restricted.\nOur primary tangible asset is Square 1 Bank. As such, we depend upon Square 1 Bank for cash distributions (through dividends on Square 1 Bank\u2019s stock) that we use to pay our operating expenses and satisfy our obligations. Such distributions would be a source of funds to pay dividends, should we elect to pay any in the future, on our common stock. There are numerous laws and banking regulations that limit Square 1 Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends to Square 1 Financial. If Square 1 Bank is unable to pay dividends to Square 1 Financial, we may not be able to satisfy our obligations or pay dividends on our common stock. Federal and state statutes and regulations restrict Square 1 Bank\u2019s ability to make cash distributions to Square 1 Financial. These statutes and regulations require, among other things, that Square 1 Bank maintain certain levels of capital in order to pay a dividend. Further, state and federal banking authorities have the ability to restrict the payment of dividends by supervisory action.\nAny future FDIC insurance premium increases may adversely affect our earnings.\nThe amount that is assessed by the FDIC for deposit insurance is set by the FDIC based on a variety of factors. These include the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund\u2019s reserve ratio, Square 1 Bank\u2019s assessment base, which is equal to average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity, and various inputs into the FDIC\u2019s assessment rate calculation. We may be required to pay higher FDIC premiums if there is an increase in the number of financial institution failures. Such higher premiums or a required premium prepayment may adversely impact our earnings.\nThe unsoundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services companies are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services companies, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems\nand could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated if the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure.\nThird party vendors provide key components of our business infrastructure such as core loan and deposit data processing systems, internet connections, network access and funds distribution. While we have selected these third party vendors carefully, we cannot control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including those which result from their failure to provide services for any reason or their poor performance of services, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise to conduct its business. Replacing these third party vendors could also entail significant delay and expense.\nWe are dependent on our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party servicers, and systems failures, interruptions or breaches of security could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur business is dependent on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party servicers. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If significant, sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, and/or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn addition, we provide our customers with the ability to bank remotely, including over the Internet and the telephone. The secure transmission of confidential information over the Internet and other remote channels is a critical element of remote banking. Our network could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes and other security breaches. We may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses. To the extent that our activities or the activities of our customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches and viruses could expose us to claims, regulatory scrutiny, litigation and other possible liabilities. Any inability to prevent security breaches or computer viruses could also cause existing customers to lose confidence in our systems and could materially and adversely affect us.\nWe continually encounter technological change. The failure to understand and adapt to these changes could negatively impact our business.\nFinancial products and services have become increasingly technology-driven. Our ability to meet the needs of our customers competitively, and in a cost-efficient manner, is dependent on the ability to keep pace with technological advances and to invest in new technology as it becomes available, which may result in incremental operating costs. Many of our competitors have greater resources to invest in technology than we do and may be better equipped to market new technology-driven products and services. The ability to keep pace with technological change is important, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse impact on our business and therefore on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risks and/or losses to us.\nWe have implemented a risk management framework to manage our risk exposure. This framework is comprised of various processes, systems and strategies, and is designed to manage the types of risk to which we are subject, including, among others, credit, market, liquidity, interest rate and compliance. Our framework also includes financial or other modeling methodologies which involve management assumptions and judgment. There is no assurance that our risk management framework will be effective under all circumstances or that it will adequately mitigate any risk or loss to us. If our framework is not effective, we could suffer unexpected losses and our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially and adversely affected. We may also be subject to potentially adverse regulatory consequences.\nWe depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties and our financial condition, results of operations, financial reporting and reputation could be negatively affected if we rely on materially misleading, false, inaccurate or fraudulent information.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and counterparties, we may rely on information furnished to us by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. We also may rely on representations of customers and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. For example, under our accounts receivable financing arrangements, we rely on information, such as invoices, contracts and other supporting documentation, provided by our clients and their account debtors to determine the amount of credit to extend. Similarly, in deciding whether to extend credit, we may rely upon our customers\u2019 representations that their financial statements conform to GAAP and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the customer. We also may rely on customer representations and certifications, or other audit or accountants\u2019 reports, with respect to the business and financial condition of our clients. Our financial condition, results of operations, financial reporting and reputation could be negatively affected if we rely on materially misleading, false, inaccurate or fraudulent information.\nInsiders have substantial control over us, and this control may limit our shareholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters and may delay or prevent a third party from acquiring control over us.\nOur directors and executive officers and their affiliates currently beneficially own, in the aggregate, 37.34% of our outstanding Class A common stock and all of our Class B common stock. The significant concentration of stock ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our Class A common stock due to investors\u2019 perception that conflicts of interest may exist or arise. In addition, these shareholders will be able to exercise influence over all matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets. This concentration of ownership could limit your ability to influence corporate matters and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control, including a merger, consolidation or other business combination involving us, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control, even if that change in control would benefit our other shareholders.\nChanges in accounting standards could materially impact our financial statements.\nFrom time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board or the SEC may change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. Such changes may result in Square 1 Financial being subject to new or changing accounting and reporting standards. In addition, the bodies that interpret the accounting standards (such as banking regulators or outside auditors) may change their interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. These changes may be beyond our control, can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retrospectively, or apply an existing standard differently, also retrospectively, in each case resulting in our needing to revise or restate prior period financial statements.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results. As a result, current and potential shareholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting which would harm our business and the trading price of our securities.\nManagement regularly reviews and updates our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or are otherwise required to restate our financial statements, we could be required to implement expensive and time-consuming remedial measures and could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports. We may also face regulatory enforcement or other actions, including the potential delisting of our securities from Nasdaq Stock Market. This could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including our stock price, and could potentially subject us to litigation.\nBusiness disruptions and interruptions due to natural disasters and other external events beyond our control can adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations can be subject to natural disasters and other external events beyond our control, such as earthquakes, fires, severe weather, public health issues, power failures, telecommunication loss, major accidents, terrorist attacks, acts of war, and other natural and man-made events. Such events of disaster, whether natural or attributable to human beings, could cause severe destruction, disruption or interruption to our operations or property. Financial institutions, such as us, generally must resume operations promptly following any interruption. If we were to suffer a disruption or interruption and were not able to resume\nnormal operations within a period consistent with industry standards, our business could suffer serious harm. In addition, depending on the nature and duration of the disruption or interruption, we might be vulnerable to fraud, additional expense or other losses, or to a loss of business and/or clients. We have implemented a business continuity and disaster recovery program which is reviewed and updated no less than annually. There is no assurance that our business continuity and disaster recovery program can adequately mitigate the risks of such business disruptions and interruptions.\nAdditionally, natural disasters and external events could affect the business and operations of our clients, which could impair their ability to pay their loans or fees when due, impair the value of collateral securing their loans, cause our clients to reduce their deposits with us, or otherwise adversely affect their business dealings with us, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to an Investment in our Common Stock\nAn investment in our common stock is not an insured deposit and is subject to risk of loss.\nAn investment in our common stock is not a bank deposit and will not be insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or any other government agency. An investment in our common stock is subject to investment risk, and an investor must be capable of affording the loss of the investor\u2019s entire investment.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years, although we could lose that status sooner if our gross revenues exceed $1.0 billion, if we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt in a three-year period, or if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30 before that time, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions, or if we choose to rely on additional exemptions in the future. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nSecurities analysts may not continue coverage on our common stock, which could adversely affect the market for our common stock.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities analysts publish about us and our business. We do not have any control over these securities analysts, and they may not cover our common stock. If securities analysts do not cover our common stock, the lack of research coverage may adversely affect its market price. If we are covered by securities analysts, and our common stock is the subject of an unfavorable report, the price of our common stock may decline. If one or more of these analysts cease to cover us or fail to publish regular reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause the price or trading volume of our common stock to decline.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nOur Board of Directors intends to retain all of our earnings to promote growth and build capital. Accordingly, we do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. In addition, our ability to pay dividends may be restricted as a result of applicable banking laws, regulations and policies and we may be unable to pay dividends, should we elect to do so, if we are not able to receive dividends from Square 1 Bank. See \u201c-We may not pay dividends if we are not able to receive dividends from our subsidiary, Square 1 Bank\u201d within this section and \u201cSupervision and Regulation-Dividend Restrictions\u201d under Item 1. Business of this report for further information. If the receipt of dividends over the near term is important to you, you should not invest in our common stock.\nOur corporate governance documents, and certain corporate and banking laws applicable to us, could make a takeover more difficult.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and corporate and federal banking laws, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of our organization or conduct a proxy contest, even if those events were perceived by many of our shareholders as beneficial to their interests. These provisions, and the corporate and banking laws and regulations applicable to us:\n\u2022\nenable our Board of Directors to issue additional shares of authorized, but unissued capital stock;\n\u2022\nenable our Board of Directors to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock with such designations, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Board;\n\u2022\nenable our Board of Directors to increase the size of the Board and fill the vacancies created by the increase;\n\u2022\nenable our Board of Directors to amend our bylaws without shareholder approval;\n\u2022\nrequire advance notice for director nominations and other shareholder proposals;\n\u2022\npermit the election of directors to staggered terms of three years;\n\u2022\ndo not permit cumulative voting by shareholders in the election of directors; and\n\u2022\nrestrict the calling of special meetings of shareholders.\nThese provisions may discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control, including under circumstances in which our shareholders might otherwise receive a premium over the market price of our shares.\nWe will be subject to business uncertainties while the Merger is pending, which could adversely affect our business.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Merger on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on us, and, consequently, the surviving corporation. These uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Merger is consummated and for a period of time thereafter, and could cause customers and others that deal with us to seek to change their existing business relationships with us. In addition, the Merger Agreement restricts us from making certain acquisitions and taking other specified actions without the consent of PacWest, and generally requires us to continue our operations in the ordinary course, until the Merger closes. These restrictions, which will be described in the proxy statement/prospectus relating to the Merger (when it becomes available), may prevent us from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the Merger.\nFailure to complete the Merger could negatively impact the stock price and the future business and financial results of the Company.\nIf the Merger is not completed for any reason, including as a result of the Company\u2019s shareholders declining to approve the Merger Agreement, our ongoing business may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the Merger, we would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on our stock price;\n\u2022\nwe may experience negative reactions from our customers, vendors and employees;\n\u2022\nwe will have incurred substantial expenses and will be required to pay certain costs relating to the Merger, whether or not the Merger is completed; and\n\u2022\nmatters relating to Merger (including integration planning) will require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management, which would otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us as an independent company.\nIn addition to the above risks, if the Merger Agreement is terminated and our board of directors seeks another merger or business combination, our shareholders cannot be certain that we will be able to find a party willing to offer equivalent or more attractive consideration than the consideration PacWest has agreed to provide in the Merger. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, we may be required to pay a termination fee of $32.5 million to PacWest. See the proxy statement/prospectus relating to the Merger (when it becomes available) for additional information.", "PERMNO": 14553, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "SQBK"}
