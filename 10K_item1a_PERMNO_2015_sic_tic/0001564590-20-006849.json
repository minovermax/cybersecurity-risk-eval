{"cik": "1095565", "company": "HEALTHSTREAM INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe believe that the risks and uncertainties described below are the significant risks facing the Company as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, and/or prospects could be materially and adversely affected by the occurrence of any of the following risks and uncertainties. Additional risks or uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, also may adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. Therefore, the risk factors below should not be considered a complete list of potential risks we may face. The trading price of our common stock could also decline due to the occurrence of any of the following risks, as well as risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial.\nRisks Related to Our Business Model\nWe may be unable to effectively execute our growth strategy which could have an adverse effect on our business and competitive position in the industry.\nOur business strategy includes increasing our market share and presence through sales to new customers, additional sales to existing customers, introductions of new products and services, participation in our ecosystem, interoperability and integration with our platform, and maintaining strong relationships with our existing customers. Risks that we may encounter in executing our growth strategy include:\n\u2022\nexpenses, delays, and difficulties in identifying and developing new products or services and integrating such new products or services into our existing organization;\n\u2022\ninability to leverage or evolve our customer and partner facing technology platform;\n\u2022\ninability to leverage our operational and financial systems and processes sufficiently to support our growth;\n\u2022\ninability to generate sufficient revenue from our products to offset investment costs;\n\u2022\ninability to effectively identify, manage, and exploit existing and emerging market opportunities;\n\u2022\ninability to maintain our existing customer relationships;\n\u2022\ninability to identify, attract, and retain partners;\n\u2022\nincreased competition from new and existing competitors;\n\u2022\nlengthy sales cycles, or customers delaying purchasing decisions or payments due to economic conditions;\n\u2022\nreduced spending by customers within our target markets;\n\u2022\nthe loss of a significant customer, including through acquisitions or consolidations;\n\u2022\na negative change in the financial condition or creditworthiness of our customers;\n\u2022\nfailure of the market for our products and services to grow to a sufficient size or at a sufficient rate; and\n\u2022\ninability to hire sufficient number of qualified employees to execute and support the growth of the Company.\nIf any of these risks are realized, our business, and our competitive position in the industry, could suffer.\nUnfavorable conditions in our industry or the U.S. economy, or reductions in information technology spending, could limit our ability to grow our business and negatively affect our operating results.\nOur operating results may vary based on the impact of changes in our industry or the United States economy on us or our clients. The revenue growth and potential profitability of our business depends on demand for workforce and provider solutions for healthcare providers. We sell our products and services to large, mid-sized and small organizations whose businesses fluctuate based on general economic and business conditions. In addition, a portion of our revenue is attributable to the number of users of our products at each of our clients, which in turn is influenced by the employment and hiring patterns of our clients and potential clients. To the extent that economic uncertainty or weak economic conditions cause our clients and potential clients to freeze or reduce their headcount, demand for our products may be negatively affected. Historically, economic downturns have resulted in overall reductions in spending by some healthcare providers as well as pressure from clients and potential clients for extended billing terms. If economic conditions deteriorate, our clients and potential clients may elect to decrease their workforce development and provider solutions budgets by deferring or reconsidering purchases, which would limit our ability to grow our business and negatively affect our operating results. In addition, while we do not currently expect that our financial results will be significantly and adversely affected by the coronavirus that was first detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019, there continue to be significant uncertainties associated with the coronavirus, including with respect to the ultimate geographic spread of the virus, the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, and actions that may be taken by Chinese or other governmental authorities to contain the coronavirus or to treat its impact, and the extent to which the coronavirus outbreak may impact our financial results, including as the result of its possible impact on the economy, including without limitation the healthcare sector, is not certain. There is also uncertainty surrounding U.S. presidential and congressional elections in 2020 and the impact on existing and future healthcare legislation. While we cannot predict the outcome of the elections or any resulting legislative changes, such changes could have a material impact on our business.\nWe may be unable to effectively identify, complete or integrate the operations of acquisitions, joint ventures, collaborative arrangements, or other strategic investments, which would inhibit our ability to execute upon our growth strategy.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we actively review possible acquisitions, joint ventures, collaborative arrangements, or strategic investments that complement or enhance our business. However, we may be unable to source or complete future acquisitions, joint ventures, collaborative arrangements, or other strategic investments on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, if we finance acquisitions, joint ventures, collaborative arrangements, or other strategic initiatives by issuing equity securities, our existing shareholders may be diluted, which could affect the market price of our stock. As a result, if we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions, joint ventures, collaborative arrangements, or strategic investments, our performance or prospects may be seriously harmed. Risks that we may encounter in implementing our acquisition, joint venture, collaborative arrangement, or strategic investment strategies include:\n\u2022\nexpenses, delays, or difficulties in identifying and integrating acquired companies or joint venture operations, collaborative arrangements, or other strategic investments into our organization and to otherwise realize expected synergies;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that we may become responsible for substantial contingent or unanticipated liabilities as the result of an acquisition, joint venture, collaborative arrangement, or other strategic investment;\n\u2022\ninability to retain personnel associated with acquired companies, joint ventures, collaborative arrangements or other strategic investments;\n\u2022\nloss of material customers and other key business relations associated with acquired companies, joint ventures, collaborative arrangements, or other strategic investments;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from other initiatives and/or day-to-day operations to effectively execute our growth strategy;\n\u2022\nthe incorporation of products associated with acquired companies, joint ventures, collaborative arrangements, or other strategic investments into our product lines;\n\u2022\nthe increasing demands on our operational and informational technology systems which may arise from any such acquired companies or joint venture operations, collaborative arrangements, or other strategic investments;\n\u2022\npotentially insufficient internal controls over financial activities or financial reporting at any such acquired company that could impact us on a consolidated basis;\n\u2022\nthe financial performance of acquired entities, joint ventures, collaborative arrangements, or other strategic investments may have a negative impact on our financial performance; and\n\u2022\nan inability to generate sufficient revenue, profit, and cash flow from acquisitions, joint ventures, collaborative arrangements, or other strategic investments to offset our investment costs.\nMoreover, although we conduct what we believe to be a prudent level of investigation regarding the operating, financial, and information security conditions of acquired companies, joint ventures, collaborative arrangements, or other strategic investments, an unavoidable level of risk remains regarding the operating performance, financial condition, information security, and potential liabilities of these businesses, and we may not be able to fully assess these risks until a transaction has been completed.\nOur ability to accurately forecast our financial performance for certain products and services may be hindered by customer scheduling.\nWhile the revenue we receive from particular products and services in our subscription business may be predictable during the term of the applicable contract, the performance of our subscription business may become more subject to fluctuations between quarterly periods as our solution offerings diversify and become more sophisticated. Certain project-based products, such as consulting, content development, and professional services, are subject to the customers\u2019 involvement in the provision of the product or service. The timing and magnitude of these project-based product and service contracts may vary widely from quarter to quarter and year to year, and thus may affect our ability to accurately forecast our financial performance. In addition, some products can require significant implementation lead times and resources and may require a level of change management efforts from our clients, which may also impact our ability to accurately forecast our financial performance. Additionally, as we expand our revenue generating model such that third parties may pay network connection fees based on sales they make, our ability to forecast revenue from such arrangements may not be predictable.\nOur ability to accurately forecast our financial performance may be affected by lengthy and widely varying sales cycles.\nThe period from our initial contact with a potential customer and their first purchase of our solution typically ranges from three to nine months, and in some cases may be significantly longer. The range in the sales cycle can be impacted by multiple factors, including an increasing trend towards more formal request for proposal processes and more competition within our industry, as well as formal budget timelines which impact timing of purchases by target customers. New products, including those that may compete with or replace our former product offerings, tend to have a longer and more unpredictable revenue ramp period because of varying customer adoption rates. As a result of these factors, we have only limited ability to forecast the timing and type of initial sales. This, in turn, makes it more difficult to forecast our financial performance. Additionally, as we expand our revenue generating model such that third parties may pay network connection fees based on sales they make, our ability to forecast revenue from such arrangements may not be predictable.\nWe may not be able to maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors, especially those with significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, or other resources.\nMany of our competitors and potential competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, or other resources than we do. We encounter direct competition from both large and small companies focused on providing workforce and provider solutions to the healthcare industry. Given the profile and growth of the healthcare industry and the ongoing need for training, simulation, credentialing, and other information products and services, it is likely that additional competitors will emerge. Additionally, mergers of or other strategic transactions by our competitors could weaken our competitive position. Moreover, our lack of market diversification resulting from our concentration on the healthcare industry may make us susceptible to losing market share to our competitors who also offer solutions, and in some cases a more robust suite of solutions, to a cross-section of industries. These companies may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. Further, most of our customer agreements are for terms ranging from one to five years, with no obligation to renew. The terms of these agreements may enable customers to more easily shift to one of our competitors.\nExpanding our business model such that third-parties may pay network connection fees in exchange for the ability to deliver their products through our technology platform and have them featured as part of our ecosystem may result in unpredictability to and/or harm to the operational and financial performance of our business.\nHistorically, the Company has marketed and sold products and services through our own sales team and for delivery through our technology platform. More recently, the Company began offering third-parties the ability to utilize their sales teams to market and sell their third-party products and have such products delivered through the Company\u2019s technology platform, provided such third-parties pay a network connectivity fee when such products are sold to customers in our network. Given that these third parties are responsible for their products and the marketing and selling thereof, the Company may not always be able to ensure the operational, financial, or security-related performance or impact of products controlled by a third-party. While we have contractual protections with third-parties regarding their products, including but not limited to service levels, information security, confidentiality, data rights, and indemnification against certain breaches, these may not be sufficient to ensure the predictability or performance of such products, or potential negative impacts related thereto.\nThe failure to maintain and strengthen our relationships with ecosystem partners or significant changes in the terms of the agreements we have with them may have an adverse impact on our ability to successfully market, sell, and deliver certain product and service offerings.\nWe have entered into contracts with ecosystem partners, including content, application, infrastructure, technology, and retail channel vendors. Our ability to increase the sales of our products and services depends in part upon maintaining and strengthening relationships with these current and future ecosystem partners. Most of these contracts are on a non-exclusive basis. Certain ecosystem partners may offer multiple products and services, including, in some instances, products or services which may compete with other products and services we offer. Moreover, under contracts with some of our ecosystem partners, we may be bound by provisions that restrict our ability to market and sell our products and services to certain potential customers. The success of these contractual arrangements will depend in part upon the ecosystem partners\u2019 own competitive, marketing, and strategic considerations, including the relative advantages for such ecosystem partners in using alternative products being developed and marketed by them or our competitors, rather than our products and services.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain and strengthen our relationships with ecosystem partners, that we will be successful in effectively integrating such partners\u2019 products and technology, including without limitation through our emerging PaaS strategy, with, into, or through our own, or that such relationships will be successful in generating additional revenue. If any of these ecosystem partners have negative experiences with our products and services, or seek to amend or terminate the financial or other terms of the contracts or arrangements we have with them, we may need to increase our organizational focus on the types of services and solutions they sell and alter our development, integration, and/or distribution strategies, which may divert our planned efforts and resources from other projects.\nWe could also be subject to claims and liability as a result of the activities, products, or services of these ecosystem partners and/or our acts or omissions with regard to these ecosystem partners. Even if these claims do not result in liability to us, investigating and defending these claims could be expensive, time-consuming, divert our attention, and result in suspension of or interference with certain offerings to our clients and/or adverse publicity that could harm our business.\nWe may not be able to retain distribution rights from our ecosystem partners, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nMost of our agreements with ecosystem partners are for initial terms of three or more years. These partners may choose not to renew their agreements with us or may terminate their agreements early if we do not fulfill our contractual obligations. If our partners terminate or fail to renew their agreements with us on as favorable terms, such as a reduction in our revenue share arrangement, it could result in a reduction in the number of courses and solutions we are able to distribute, declines in the number of subscribers to our platforms, and decreased revenues. Most of our agreements with our ecosystem partners are non-exclusive, and our competitors offer, or could offer, solutions that are similar to or the same as those we offer. If our current partners offer or otherwise make available their products and services to users or our competitors on more favorable terms than those offered to us, or increase our license fees, our competitive position, revenue, and our profit margins and prospects could be harmed.\nWe may not be able to develop new products and services, or enhancements to our existing products and services, or be able to achieve widespread acceptance of new products, services or features, or keep pace with technological developments.\nOur growth strategy depends in part on our ability to generate revenue growth through sales to new customers as well as increasing sales of additional subscriptions and other products and services to existing customers. Our identification of additional features, content, products, and services may not result in timely development of complementary products. In addition, the success of certain new products and services may be dependent on continued growth in our customer base. Furthermore, we are not able to accurately predict the volume or speed with which existing and new customers may adopt such new products and services. Because healthcare technology continues to change and evolve, we may be unable to accurately predict and develop new products, features, content, and other products to address the needs of the healthcare industry. Further, the new products, services, and enhancements we develop may introduce significant defects into or otherwise negatively impact our technology platform. While all new products and services are subject to testing and quality control, all software and software-based services are subject to errors and malfunctions. If we release new products, services, and/or enhancements with bugs, defects, or errors or that cause bugs, defects, or errors in existing products, it could result in lost revenues and/or reduced ability to meet contractual obligations and would be detrimental to our business and reputation. If new products, features, or content are not accepted or integrated by new or existing customers, we may not be able to recover the cost of this development, and our financial performance will be harmed. Continued growth of our customer population is dependent on our ability to continue to provide relevant products and services in a timely manner. The success of our business will depend on our ability to continue providing our products and services as well as enhancing our content, product, and service offerings that address the needs of healthcare organizations.\nWe may be unable to continue to license our third-party software, on which a portion of our product and service offerings rely, or we may experience errors in this software, which could increase our costs and decrease our revenue.\nWe use technology components in some of our products that have been licensed from third parties. Future licenses to these technologies may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. The loss of or inability to obtain or maintain any of these licenses could result in delays in the introduction of new products and services or could force us to discontinue offering portions of solutions until equivalent technology, if available, is identified, licensed, and integrated. The operation of our products would be impaired if errors occur in third party technology or content that we incorporate, and we may incur additional costs to repair or replace the defective technology or content. It may be difficult for us to correct any errors in third party products because the products are not within our control. Accordingly, our revenue could decrease, and our costs could increase in the event of any errors in this technology. Furthermore, we may become subject to legal claims related to licensed technology based on product liability, infringement of intellectual property, or other legal theories. Even if these claims do not result in liability to us, investigating and defending these claims could be expensive and time-consuming, and could result in suspension of or interference with certain offerings to our clients and/or adverse publicity that could harm our business.\nFinancial Risks\nA significant portion of our revenue is generated from a relatively small number of customers.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a relatively small number of customers. A termination or material modification of our agreements with any of our significant customers or a failure of these customers to renew their contracts on favorable terms, or at all, could have an adverse effect on our business.\nA significant portion of our business is subject to renewal. Therefore, renewals have a significant impact on our revenue and operating results.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, approximately 95% of our net revenue was derived from SaaS-based subscriptions and software licensing agreements. Our product and service contracts typically range from one to five years in length, and customers are not obligated to renew their contract with us after their contract term expires; in fact, some customers have elected not to renew their contract. In addition, our customers may renew at a lower pricing or activity level. Our customers\u2019 renewals may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including but not limited to, their dissatisfaction with our service, a dissipation or cessation of their need for one or more of our products or services, pricing, or competitive product offerings. If we are unable to renew a substantial portion of the contracts that are up for renewal or maintain our pricing, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nFailure to adequately expand and optimize our direct sales infrastructure will impede our growth.\nWe will need to continue to expand and optimize our sales infrastructure in order to grow our customer base and our business. Identifying and recruiting qualified personnel and training them in our sales methodology, our sales systems, and the use of our software requires significant time, expense, and attention. It can take significant time before our sales representatives are fully trained and productive. Our business may be adversely affected if our efforts to expand and train our direct sales teams do not generate a corresponding increase in revenues. In particular, if we are unable to hire, develop, and retain talented sales personnel or if new direct sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time, we may not be able to realize the expected benefits of this investment or increase our revenues.\nWe may be unable to accurately predict the timing of revenue recognition from sales activity as it is often dependent on achieving certain events or performance milestones, and this inability could impact our operating results.\nOur ability to recognize revenue is dependent upon several factors in order for us to implement customers on our subscription-based platform and platform applications. If customers do not provide us with the information required to complete implementations in a timely manner, our ability to recognize revenue may be delayed, which could adversely impact our operating results. Some products, including several in our Provider Solutions segment, can require significant implementation lead times and the rate at which customer orders move from backlog to revenue generation in connection with these products may significantly affect the timing of revenue recognition.\nBecause we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our products and services over the term of the subscription period, downturns or upturns in sales may not be immediately reflected in our operating results.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized approximately 95% of our revenue from customers monthly over the terms of their subscription or licensing agreements, which generally have contract terms ranging from one to five years. As a result, much of the revenue we report in each quarter is related to subscription or licensing agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscription or licensing agreements in any one quarter will not necessarily be fully reflected in the revenue in that quarter and will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. In addition, we may be unable to adjust our cost structure to reflect this reduced revenue. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our products and services may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Additionally, our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term.\nWe may not be able to meet our strategic business objectives unless we obtain additional financing, which may not be available to us on favorable terms, or at all.\nWe may need to raise additional funds for various purposes, including to:\n\u2022\ndevelop new, or enhance existing, products, services, and technology;\n\u2022\nrespond to competitive pressures;\n\u2022\nfinance working capital requirements;\n\u2022\nacquire or invest in complementary businesses, technologies, content, or products; or\n\u2022\notherwise effectively execute our growth strategy.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had approximately $172.9 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. We also have up to $50.0 million of availability under our Revolving Credit Facility, subject to certain covenants, which expires in November 2020.\nWe actively review possible business acquisitions to complement or enhance our products, services, and technology platforms. We may not have adequate cash and investments or availability under our Revolving Credit Facility to consummate one or more of these acquisitions. We cannot assure you that if we need additional financing, it will be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to fund expansion, take advantage of available opportunities, develop or enhance services or products, or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our existing shareholders may be reduced.\nGoodwill, identifiable intangible assets, and long-lived assets recorded on our balance sheet may be subject to impairment losses that could reduce our reported assets and earnings.\nThere are inherent uncertainties in the estimates, judgments, and assumptions used in assessing recoverability of goodwill, intangible assets, and long-lived assets. Economic, legal, regulatory, competitive, reputational, contractual, and other factors could result in future declines in the operating results of our business units or market values that do not support the carrying value of goodwill, identifiable intangible assets, and long-lived assets. If the value of our goodwill, intangible assets, or long-lived assets is impaired, accounting principles require us to reduce their carrying value and report an impairment charge, which would reduce our reported assets and earnings for the period in which an impairment is recognized.\nWe may be affected by healthcare reform efforts and other changes in the healthcare industry that impact us and our clients.\nOur clients are concentrated in the healthcare industry, which is subject to changing regulatory, economic, and political conditions. In the past several years, we have experienced an increase in bankruptcies among our customers. This decrease in creditworthiness among certain of our customers along with other economic challenges facing the healthcare sector caused us to record bad debt expense of $0.2 million, $1.0 million and $1.6 million in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Any continuation or escalation of this development could result in our inability to collect amounts owed from existing clients and decrease our ability to gain new clients, which could adversely impact our revenue, results of operations, and ability to execute on our growth strategy.\nThe U.S. Congress and certain state legislatures have passed or are considering laws and regulations intended to result in major changes to the U.S. healthcare system. The most prominent of these reform efforts, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, Affordable Care Act), was designed to increase access to affordable health insurance for U.S. citizens and improve quality of care, but it also has reduced government program spending and imposed operating costs and changes on many of our clients.\nEfforts by the presidential administration and certain members of Congress to repeal or make significant changes to the Affordable Care Act, its implementation, and/or its interpretation have cast considerable uncertainty on the future of the law. For example, final rules issued in 2018 expand the availability of association health plans and allow the sale of short-term, limited-duration health plans, neither of which are required to cover all the essential health benefits mandated by the Affordable Care Act. Effective January 1, 2019, the financial penalty associated with the individual mandate was eliminated as part of the tax reform legislation which was enacted in December 2017. These changes may impact the number of individuals that elect to purchase health insurance or the scope of such coverage, if purchased. Because the penalty associated with the individual mandate was eliminated, a federal judge in Texas ruled in December 2018 that the mandate was unconstitutional and determined that the rest of the Affordable Care Act was therefore invalid. In December 2019, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld this decision with respect to the individual mandate but remanded for further consideration the issue of how this affects the rest of the law. Pending this appeals process, the law remains in place pending appeal. There is uncertainty regarding whether, when, and how the Affordable Care Act will be further changed, the ultimate impact of court challenges, how the law will be interpreted and implemented, and the impact of other initiatives intended to reform healthcare delivery, coverage, and/or financial systems. For example, some members of Congress have proposed significantly expanding the coverage of government-funded programs. Any such legal or regulatory developments, as well as other healthcare-related or other developments that adversely impact the business or financial condition of our clients, could reduce the amount of business we receive from such clients and thus have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nSome of the recent changes in the healthcare industry have driven consolidation, particularly among health insurance providers. Other industry participants, such as large employer groups and their affiliates, may also introduce financial or delivery system reforms or otherwise intensify competitive pressures. These developments could adversely affect us or our customers and therefore have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe may discover weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, which may adversely affect investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and consequently the market price of our securities.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires our management to report on and requires our independent public accounting firm to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. The rules governing the standards to be met are complex and may require significant process review, documentation and testing, as well as remediation efforts for any identified deficiencies. This process of review, documentation, testing, and remediation may result in increased expenses and require significant attention from management and other internal and external resources. These requirements may also extend to acquired entities and our efforts to integrate those operations into our system of internal controls. Any material weaknesses identified during this process may preclude us from asserting the effectiveness of our internal controls. This may negatively affect our stock price if we cannot effectively remediate the issues identified in a timely manner.\nChanges in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, could adversely effect our balance sheet, revenue, and results of operations, and could require a significant expenditure of time, attention and resources, especially by senior management.\nOur accounting and financial reporting policies conform to GAAP, which are periodically revised and/or expanded. The application of accounting principles is also subject to varying interpretations over time. Accordingly, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or comply with revised interpretations that are issued from time to time by various parties, including accounting standard setters and those who interpret the standards, such as the FASB and the SEC and our independent registered public accounting firm. Changes to regulations concerning revenue recognition could require us to alter our current revenue accounting practices and cause us to either defer revenue into a future period or to recognize lower revenue in a current period. Likewise, changes to regulations concerning expense recognition could require us to alter our current expense accounting practices and cause us to defer recognition of expense into a future period or to recognize increased expenses in a current period. Such changes could also cause us to alter the manner in which we contract for, sell, and incentivize sales of products and services. Changes to either revenue recognition or expense recognition accounting practices could affect our financial results.\nRisks Related to Operations\nOur operating margins could be affected if our ongoing refinement to pricing models for our products and services is not accepted by our customers and the market.\nWe continue to make changes in the pricing of our product and service offerings so as to increase revenue and meet the needs of our customers. We cannot predict whether the current pricing of our products and services, or any ongoing refinements we make, will be accepted by our existing customer base or by prospective customers. If our customers and potential customers decide not to accept our current or future pricing or product and service offerings, it could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Additionally, ecosystem partners establish the price for some of the products we market and sell, and we do not have control over such price setting or customer acceptance thereof or reaction thereto.\nWe may be unable to adequately develop our systems, processes, and support in a manner that will enable us to meet the demand for our services.\nWe have provided our online products and services for a significant period of time and continue to expand our ability to provide our solutions on both a subscription and transactional basis over the Internet or otherwise. Our future success will depend on our ability to effectively develop and maintain our infrastructure, including procurement of additional hardware and software, integrate and interoperate with third party systems, and to implement the services, including customer support, necessary to meet the demand for our products and services. Our inability from time to time to successfully develop the necessary systems and implement the necessary services on a timely basis may result in our customers experiencing delays, interruptions, and/or errors in their service. Such delays or interruptions may cause customers to become dissatisfied with our service and move to competing providers of workforce development and provider solutions services. If this happens, our reputation, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur business operations could be significantly disrupted if we lose members of, or fail to attract and integrate new members to, our management team.\nOur future performance is substantially dependent on the continued services of our management team and our ability to attract, retain, and motivate them. The loss of the services of any of our officers or senior managers, or the inability to attract additional officers or senior managers as appropriate, could harm our business, as we may not be able to find suitable replacements. We do not have employment agreements with any of our key personnel, other than our chief executive officer, and we do not maintain any \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance policies.\nWe may not be able to attract, hire, and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees and, as a result, we may not be able to effectively execute our growth strategy or maintain the quality of our services.\nOur future success will depend on our ability to attract, train, motivate, and retain other highly skilled technical, managerial, marketing, sales, and customer support personnel. Competition for certain personnel is intense, especially for software developers, web designers, user experience and interaction designers, and sales personnel, and we may be unable to successfully attract sufficiently qualified personnel. We have experienced in the past, and continue to experience, difficulty hiring qualified personnel in a timely manner for these positions, and we may not be able to fill positions in desired geographic areas or at all. The pool of qualified technical personnel, in particular, is limited in Nashville, Tennessee, where our headquarters are located. Similar challenges exist within our Provider Solutions segment in our locations in San Diego, California, and Boulder, Colorado. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have and some of these companies may offer more lucrative compensation packages. We anticipate needing to continue to maintain or increase the size of our staff to support our anticipated growth, without compromising the quality of our offerings or customer service. Our inability to locate, attract, hire, integrate and retain qualified personnel in sufficient numbers may reduce the quality of our services and impair our ability to grow and adversely impact our financial performance.\nWe may not be able to upgrade our hardware and software technology infrastructure quickly enough to effectively meet demand for our services or our operational needs.\nWe must continue to obtain reasonably priced, commercially available hardware, operating software, and hosting services, as well as continue to enhance our software and systems to accommodate the increased use of our platform, the increased content in our library, the expanding amount and type of data we store on behalf of our customers, and the resulting increase in operational demands on our business. Decisions about hardware and software enhancements are based in part on estimated forecasts of the growth in demand for our services. This growth in demand for our services is difficult to forecast and the potential audience for our services is widespread and dynamic. If we are unable to increase the data storage and processing capacity of our systems at least as fast as the growth in demand, our customers may encounter delays or disruptions in their service. Unscheduled downtime or reduced response time of our platforms could harm our business and\ncould discourage current and potential customers from using or continuing to use our services and reduce future revenue. If we are unable to acquire, update, or enhance our technology infrastructure and systems quickly enough to effectively meet increased operational demands on our business, that may also have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Further, our applications necessarily must integrate with a variety of systems and technologies. As we develop our platforms and rely on ever changing and improving technologies, we may be impeded by our customers\u2019 and ecosystem partners\u2019 inability to adopt new technologies and technology standards upon which new platform enhancements may be based.\nOur network infrastructure and computer systems and software may fail.\nAn unexpected event (including but not limited to a cyber-security incident, telecommunications failure, fire, earthquake, or other catastrophic loss) at our Internet service providers\u2019 facilities, at our on-site data center facilities, or our public-cloud infrastructure providers, could cause the loss of critical data and prevent us from offering our products and services for an unknown period of time. System downtime could negatively affect our reputation and ability to sell our products and services and may expose us to significant third-party claims. Our cyber liability and business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur. In addition, we rely on third parties to securely store our archived data, house our infrastructure and network systems, and connect us to the Internet. While our service providers have planned for certain contingencies, the failure by any of these third parties to provide these services satisfactorily and our inability to find suitable replacements would impair our ability to access archives and operate our systems and software, and our customers may encounter delays. Such disruptions could harm our reputation and cause customers to become dissatisfied and possibly take their business to a competing provider, which would adversely affect our financial performance.\nA data breach or security incident could result in a loss of confidential data, give rise to remediation and other expenses, expose us to liability under HIPAA, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), foreign data privacy regulations, federal and state privacy laws, consumer protection laws, common law theories or other laws, subject us to litigation and federal and state governmental inquiries, damage our reputation, and otherwise could adversely impact our business.\nThere are a variety of other state, national, foreign, and international laws and regulations that apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, security, disclosure, transfer, and other processing of personal data. California has passed the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA), which took effect January 1, 2020. The CCPA applies broadly to information that identifies or is associated with any California household or individual, and compliance with the CCPA requires that we implement several operational changes, including processes to respond to individuals\u2019 data access and deletion requests. In addition, many foreign data privacy regulations (including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which became effective in the European Union on May 25, 2018, and China\u2019s Cybersecurity Law which became effective in 2017) can be more stringent than those in the United States. These laws and regulations are rapidly evolving and changing and could have an adverse effect on our operations. Companies\u2019 obligations and requirements under these laws and regulations are subject to uncertainty in how they may be interpreted by government authorities and regulators. The costs of compliance with, and the other burdens imposed by, these and other laws or regulatory actions may increase our operational costs, affect our customers\u2019 willingness to permit us to use and store personal data, prevent us from selling our products or services, and/or affect our ability to invest in or jointly develop products. We may also face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations.\nWe collect and store sensitive information, including intellectual property, individually identifiable health information, provider credentialing and privileging data, and other personally identifiable information, on our networks. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our business operations. As a result, the continued development and enhancement of controls, processes, and practices designed to protect our information systems from attack, damage, or unauthorized access remain a priority for us. If the security measures that we use to protect customer or personal information are ineffective, we may lose users of our services, which could reduce our revenue, tarnish our reputation, and subject us to significant liability. In addition, if our subcontractors or subprocessors fail to use adequate security or data protection processes or use personal date in an unpermitted or improper manner, we may be liable for certain losses and may damage our reputation.\nWe have implemented multiple layers of security measures to protect confidential data that we collect and store through technology, processes, and our people, and our defenses are monitored and routinely tested internally and by external parties. We rely, in part, on security and authentication technology licensed from third parties. With this technology, we perform real-time credit card authorization and verification, as well as the encryption of other selected secure customer data. We cannot predict whether these security measures could be circumvented by new technological developments. Further, the audit processes, penetration and vulnerability testing, and controls used within our production platforms, may not be sufficient to identify and prevent errors or deliberate misuse. In addition, our software, databases, and servers may be vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic attacks, and similar disruptions. We may be at increased risk because we outsource certain services or functions to, or have systems that interface with, third parties. For example, third party IT vendors may not provide us with fixes or updates to hardware or software in a manner as to avoid an unauthorized loss or\ndisclosure or to address a known vulnerability, which may subject us to known threats or downtime as a result of those delays. Third party vendors that store or have access to our data may not have effective controls, processes, or practices to protect our information from attack, damage, or unauthorized access. A breach or attack affecting any of these third parties could harm our business. We cannot assure that we can prevent all security breaches.\nDespite these efforts, a data breach or security incident could result from a variety of circumstances and events, including third-party action, system errors or downtime, employee negligence or error, malfeasance, failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases, or components thereof, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophic events, or threats from malicious persons and groups, new vulnerabilities, and advanced new attacks against information systems. Data incidents could result in interruptions, delays, loss, access, misappropriation, and disclosure or corruption of data which could damage our reputation and could otherwise adversely impact our business. There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to data incidents that bypass our security measures, result in loss of confidential information, or dispute our information systems or business. In addition, data incidents could expose us and our customers to liability under privacy, security, and consumer protection laws, such as HIPAA, CCPA and foreign data privacy regulations, or litigation under these or other laws, including common law theories, and subject us to federal and state governmental inquiries or enforcement, especially if a large number of individuals are affected or if the compromised information is highly sensitive. Like many other organizations, we have experienced data incidents from time to time in the course of our business and handled these incidents in accordance with our internal policies and understanding of the applicable laws. We may need to spend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by any breaches.\nFurthermore, we have acquired a number of companies, products, services, and technologies over the years. Although we devote significant resources to address any security issues with respect to such acquisitions, we still may inherit additional risks when we integrate those companies within HealthStream. Moreover, if a high-profile security breach occurs with respect to an industry peer, our customers and potential customers may lose trust in the security of our solutions in general.\nAs threats to confidential information continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our internal processes, governance, protective measures, or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities. The occurrence of a data incident and the resulting potential costs and liabilities could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations and harm our business reputation.\nWe may experience errors or omissions in our software products or processes, including those that deliver provider credentialing, privileging, and payer enrollment services for our hospitals and medical practice customers and those that administer and report on hospital performance, and these errors could result in action taken against us that could harm our business.\nHospitals and medical practices use our credentialing, privileging, and payer enrollment software to manage, validate, and maintain their providers\u2019 credentials and authorization to practice in a particular facility and to maintain authorization to perform care covered by insurance providers. In some instances, we rely on sources outside the Company for information that we use in our credentialing and privileging products. If errors or omissions occur that inaccurately validate or invalidate the credentials of a provider, or improperly deny or authorize a provider to practice in a hospital or medical practice, these errors or omissions could result in litigation brought against us either by our customers, the provider, or other interested parties. For example, an important element in a malpractice case brought against a hospital or other provider could be the validation of proper credentialing for the provider, and any errors or omissions in our products that provide these services could subject us to claims. Further, a list of providers\u2019 privileges may be made available to the general public by hospitals and medical practices, and errors in credentialing and privileging may result in damage to the hospital, medical practice, or provider.\nWe may be required to indemnify against such claims, and defending against any such claims could be costly and time-consuming and could negatively affect our business.\nThe expiration of our legacy agreements with Laerdal could adversely affect our business and future results of operations.\nOur legacy agreements with Laerdal (Legacy Agreements) for the HeartCode and Resuscitation Quality Improvement (RQI) products expired pursuant to their terms on December 31, 2018 and were not renewed. Revenues associated with sales of HeartCode and RQI products pursuant to the Legacy Agreements have been significant in recent years, although margins on such products have been lower than HealthStream\u2019s average margin. Revenues from these products were $58.9 million in 2019 and are expected to decline to approximately $36.0 million in 2020 (with sequential declines anticipated in each quarter\nof 2020) as we conclude the fulfillment of HeartCode and RQI purchases made prior to December 31, 2018 and will be approximately zero beginning with the first quarter of 2021.\nWhile we have entered into agreements to market, sell, and deliver new resuscitation programs to our customers (i.e., other than HeartCode and RQI), including through our collaboration with the American Red Cross which was announced in January 2019, there is no assurance that we will be successful in efforts to market, sell, or deliver such products. To the extent we are not successful in these efforts and new resuscitation programs do not generate revenue and/or earnings in a manner that supplants the impact of the Legacy Agreements, our revenue and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation, Content and Intellectual Property\nGovernment regulation may subject us to investigation, litigation, or liability or require us to change the way we do business.\nThe laws and regulations that govern our business change rapidly. Evolving areas of law that are relevant to our business include privacy and security laws, proposed encryption laws, content regulation, information security accountability regulation, sales and use tax laws, and regulations and attempts to regulate activities on the Internet. For example, we are directly subject to certain requirements of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations. In addition, we are required through contracts with our customers known as \u201cbusiness associate agreements\u201d to protect the privacy and security of certain personal and health related information. Further, government laws and regulations, such as the Affordable Care Act, that directly affect our customers, can have an indirect impact on our business.\nWe may lose sales from existing or potential customers, or incur significant expenses, if states are successful in imposing states sales and use taxes on our services to a greater degree than is currently the case or we inherit potential states and use tax compliance issues in connection with acquisitions we may make from time to time. A successful assertion by one or more states that we should collect sales or uses taxes on the sale of our services to a greater degree than is our current practice could result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales, decrease our ability to compete on pricing with other vendors, and otherwise harm our business. Each state has different rules and regulations governing sales and use taxes, and these rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations that may change over time. We cannot assure you that we will not be subject to sales and use taxes or related penalties for past sales in states where we believe no compliance is necessary.\nThe rapidly evolving and uncertain regulatory and technology environment could require us to change how we do business or incur additional costs. It may be difficult to predict how changes to these laws and regulations might affect our business. Our current and past privacy and security practices, including any breaches of protected health information or other data, could be subject to review or other investigation by various state and federal regulatory authorities or could become the subject of future litigation.\nFailure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including those governing privacy and security, could subject us to civil and criminal penalties, subject us to contractual penalties (including termination of our customer agreements), adversely affect our ability to retain clients and attract new clients, damage our reputation, or otherwise have a detrimental impact on our business.\nAny reduction or change in the regulation of continuing education and training in the healthcare industry may adversely affect our business.\nA portion of our business model is dependent in part on required training and continuing education for healthcare professionals and other healthcare workers resulting from regulations of state and federal agencies, state licensing boards, and professional organizations. Any change in these regulations that reduce the requirements for continuing education and training for the healthcare industry could harm our business. In addition, a portion of our business with pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers and hospitals is predicated on our ability to maintain accreditation status with organizations such as the ACCME and ANCC. The failure to maintain status as an accredited provider could have a detrimental effect on our business.\nWe may be liable to third parties for content that is sold or made available by us.\nWe may be liable to third parties for the content sold or made available by us if the text, graphics, software, or other content therein violates copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property rights, if our ecosystem partners violate their contractual obligations to others by providing content that we sell or make available, or if the content is inaccurate, incomplete, or does not conform to accepted standards of care in the healthcare profession. Further, we may be liable to these ecosystem partners\nif we allow access or release and lose control of their intellectual property stored on our platform either due to security issues or through improper release to customers who have not paid for access to such intellectual property. We attempt to minimize these types of liabilities by requiring representations and warranties relating to our intellectual property partners\u2019 ownership of the rights to distribute as well as the accuracy of their intellectual property. We also take necessary measures to review this intellectual property ourselves. Although our agreements with our ecosystem partners in most instances contain provisions providing for indemnification by the ecosystem partners in the event of inaccurate intellectual property, our ecosystem partners may not have the financial resources to meet these indemnification obligations. Alleged liability could harm our business by damaging our reputation, requiring us to incur legal costs in defense, exposing us to awards of damages and costs, and diverting management\u2019s attention away from our business.\nProtection of certain intellectual property may be difficult and costly, and our inability to protect our intellectual property could reduce the value of our products and services.\nDespite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, as well as the intellectual property rights of our ecosystem partners, a third party could, without authorization, copy or otherwise misappropriate our content, information from our databases, or other intellectual property, including that of our third-party ecosystem partners. Our agreements with employees, consultants, and others who participate in development activities could be breached and result in our trade secrets becoming known. Alternatively, competitors and other third parties may independently develop or create content or systems that do not infringe our intellectual property rights. We may not have adequate remedies for such breaches or protections against such competitor developments. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and effective intellectual property protection may not be available in those jurisdictions.\nOur business could be harmed if unauthorized parties infringe upon or misappropriate our intellectual property, proprietary systems, content, platform, services, or other information or the intellectual property of our ecosystem partners. Our efforts to protect our intellectual property through copyright, trademarks, and other controls, as well as our efforts to protect the intellectual property of our ecosystem partners, may not be adequate. For instance, we may not be able to secure trademark or service mark registrations for marks in the United States or in foreign countries, or to secure patents for our proprietary products and services, and even if we are successful in obtaining patent and/or trademark registrations, these registrations may be opposed or invalidated by a third party. We also have certain contractual obligations to protect the intellectual property of our ecosystem partners and could be required to indemnify such ecosystem partners if we do not adequately provide such protections.\nThere has been substantial litigation in the software services and healthcare technology industries regarding intellectual property assets, particularly patents. Third parties may claim infringement by us with respect to current and future products, trademarks, or other proprietary rights, and we may counterclaim against such third parties in such actions. Any such claims or counterclaims could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, divert management\u2019s attention, cause product release delays, require us to redesign our products, restrict our use of the intellectual property subject to such claim, or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, any of which could have an adverse effect upon our business, financial condition, and operating results. Such royalty and licensing agreements may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nWe may be liable for infringing the intellectual property rights of others.\nOur competitors may develop similar intellectual property, duplicate our products and/or services, or design around any patents or other intellectual property rights we hold. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the patents, intellectual property, or other proprietary rights of third parties, which could be time consuming and costly and have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Intellectual property infringement claims could be made against us and our ecosystem partners, especially as the number of our competitors grows. These claims, even if not meritorious, could be expensive and divert our attention from operating our company and result in a temporary inability to use the intellectual property subject to such claim. In addition, if we, our ecosystem partners, and/or customers become liable to third parties for infringing their intellectual property rights, we could be required to pay a substantial damage award and develop comparable non-infringing intellectual property, to obtain a license, or to cease providing the content or services that contain the infringing intellectual property. We may be unable to develop non-infringing intellectual property or obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nWe use open source software in our products, which could subject us to litigation or other actions.\nWe use open source software in our products and may use more open source software in the future. From time to time, there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate open source software into their products. As a result, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. Litigation could be costly for us to defend, have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our products. In addition, if we were to combine our proprietary software products with open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain of the open source licenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software products. If we inappropriately use open source software, we may be required to re-engineer our products, discontinue the sale of our products, or take other remedial actions.\nOther Risks\nIt may be difficult for a third party to acquire our company, and this could depress our stock price.\nTennessee corporate law and our charter and bylaws contain provisions that could delay, defer, or prevent a change in control of our company or our management. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other shareholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions:\n\u2022\nauthorize us to issue \"blank check\" preferred stock, which is preferred stock that can be created and issued by the board of directors, without prior shareholder approval, with rights senior to those of common stock;\n\u2022\nprovide for a staggered board of directors comprised of three classes such that it would take three successive annual meetings to replace all directors;\n\u2022\nprohibit shareholder action by written consent; and\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for submitting nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by shareholders at a meeting.\nThese provisions, either alone or in combination with each other, give our current directors a substantial ability to influence the outcome of a proposed acquisition of the Company. These provisions would apply even if an acquisition or other significant corporate transaction was considered beneficial by some of our shareholders. If a change in control or change in management is delayed or prevented by these provisions, the market price of our securities could decline. As a result, these provisions could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 88167, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "HSTM"}
