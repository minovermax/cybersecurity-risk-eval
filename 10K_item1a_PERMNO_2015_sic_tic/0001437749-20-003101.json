{"cik": "95574", "company": "SUPERIOR GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-20", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business, operations and financial condition are subject to various risks, and many of those risks are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict. The following discussion addresses those risks that management believes are the most significant. You should take those risks into account in evaluating or making any investment decision involving the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that we currently believe to be less significant may also adversely affect us.\nRisks Relating to Our Industries\nWe face intense competition within our industries and our revenue and/or profits may decrease if we are not able to respond to this competition effectively.\nCustomers in the uniform and corporate identity apparel, promotional products, and business process outsourcing industries choose suppliers primarily based upon the quality, price and breadth of products and services offered. We encounter competition from a number of companies in the geographic areas we serve. Major competitors for our Uniforms and Related Products segment include companies such as ARAMARK Corporation, Cintas Corporation, Lands\u2019 End, Inc., Medline Industries, Inc., Standard Textile Co., Inc., Strategic Partners, Inc., Twin Hill and UniFirst Corporation. Major competitors for our Promotional Products segment include companies such as BDA, Inc., HALO Branded Solutions, Inc., Staples, Inc., and InnerWorkings, Inc. Major competitors for our Remote Staffing Solutions segment include companies such as APAC Customer Services, Atento, Concentrix, Sitel, Sykes, and Teleperformance. We also compete with a multitude of foreign, regional and local competitors that vary by market. If our existing or future competitors seek to gain or retain market share by reducing prices, we may be required to lower our prices, which would adversely affect our operating results. Similarly, if customers or potential customers perceive the products or services offered by our existing or future competitors to be of higher quality than ours or part of a broader product mix, our revenues may decline, which would adversely affect our operating results.\nGlobal, national or regional economic slowdowns, high unemployment levels, fewer jobs, changes in tax laws or cost increases might have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur primary products within our Uniform and Related Products segment are used by workers and, as a result, our business prospects are dependent upon levels of employment and overall economic conditions on a global, national and regional level, among other factors. Our revenues are impacted by our customers\u2019 opening and closing of locations and reductions and increases in headcount, including from voluntary turnover and increased automation, which affect the quantity of uniform orders on a per-employee basis. If we are unable to offset these effects, such as through the addition of new customers, the penetration of existing customers with a broader mix of product and service offerings, or decreased production costs that can be passed on in the form of lower prices, our revenue growth rates will be negatively impacted. Likewise, increases in tax rates or other changes in tax laws or other regulations can negatively affect our profitability.\nWhile we do not believe that our exposure is greater than that of our competitors, we could be adversely affected by increases in the prices of fabric, natural gas, gasoline, wages, employee benefits, insurance costs and other components of product cost unless we can recover such increases through proportional increases in the prices for our products and services. Competitive and general economic conditions might limit our ability and that of our competitors to increase prices to cover any increases in our product cost.\nVolatility in the global financial markets could adversely affect results.\nIn the past, global financial markets have experienced extreme disruption, including, among other things, volatility in securities prices, diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others. There can be no assurance that there will not be further change or volatility, which could lead to challenges in our business and negatively impact our financial results. Any future tightening of credit in financial markets could adversely affect the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations and could result in a decrease in orders and spending for our products and services. We are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of any disruption in financial markets and adverse economic conditions and the effects they may have on our business and financial condition.\nThe uniform and corporate identity apparel and promotional products industries are subject to pricing pressures that may cause us to lower the prices we charge for our products and adversely affect our financial performance.\nMany of our competitors also source their product requirements from developing countries to achieve a lower cost operating environment, possibly with lower costs than our offshore facilities, and those manufacturers may use these cost savings to reduce prices. Some of our competitors have more purchasing power than we do, which may enable them to obtain products at lower costs. To remain competitive, we may adjust our prices and margins from time-to-time in response to these industry-wide pricing pressures. Additionally, increased customer demands for allowances, incentives and other forms of economic support could reduce our margins and affect our profitability. Our financial performance will be negatively affected by these pricing pressures if we are forced to reduce our prices and we cannot reduce our product costs proportionally or if our product costs increase and we cannot increase our prices proportionally.\nIncreases in the price of finished goods and raw materials used to manufacture our products could materially increase our costs and decrease our profitability.\nThe principal fabrics used for our uniforms are made from cotton, wool, synthetic and cotton-synthetic blends. The principal components in our promotional products are plastic, glass, fabric and metal. The prices we pay for these fabrics and components and our finished goods are dependent on the market price for the raw materials used to produce them, primarily cotton and chemical components of synthetic fabrics including raw materials such as chemicals and dyestuffs. These finished goods and raw materials are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, government regulations, economic and political climate, currency exchange rates, labor costs, and other unpredictable factors. Fluctuations in petroleum prices also may influence the prices of related items such as chemicals, dyestuffs and polyester yarn.\nAny increase in raw material prices increases our cost of sales and can decrease our profitability unless we are able to pass the costs on to our customers in the form of higher prices. In addition, if one or more of our competitors is able to reduce their production costs by taking advantage of any reductions in raw material prices or favorable sourcing agreements, we may face pricing pressures from those competitors and may be forced to reduce our prices or face a decline in revenues, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges to trade regulation, quotas, duties, tariffs or other restrictions caused by the changing U.S. and geopolitical environments or otherwise, such as those with respect to China, may materially harm our revenue and results of operations, such as by increasing our costs and/or limiting the amount of products that we can import.\nOur operations are subject to various international trade agreements and regulations, such as the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR), Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA), Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement Act, as amended (HOPE), the Food Conservation and Energy Act of 2008 (HOPE II), the Haiti Economic Lift Program of 2010 (HELP), the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), and the activities and regulations of the World Trade Organization (WTO). Generally, these trade agreements and regulations benefit our business by reducing or eliminating the quotas, duties and/or tariffs assessed on products manufactured in a particular country. However, trade agreements and regulations can also impose requirements that have a material adverse effect on our business, revenue and results of operations, such as limiting the countries from which we can purchase raw materials, limiting the products that qualify as duty free, and setting quotas, duties and/or tariffs on products that may be imported into the United States from a particular country.\nThe countries in which our products are manufactured or into which they are imported may from time-to-time impose new quotas, duties, tariffs and requirements as to where raw materials must be purchased to qualify for free or reduced duty. These countries also may create additional workplace regulations or other restrictions on our imports or adversely modify existing restrictions. Adverse changes in these costs and restrictions could harm our business. We cannot assure that future trade agreements or regulations will not provide our competitors an advantage over us or increase our costs, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Nor can we assure that the changing geopolitical and U.S. political environments will not result in a trade agreement or regulation being altered which adversely affects our company. Specifically, the current U.S. administration has voiced strong concerns about imports from countries that it perceives as engaging in unfair trade practices, and may decide to impose or alter existing import quotas, duties, tariffs or other restrictions on products or raw materials sourced from those countries, which include countries from which we import raw materials or in which we manufacture our products. Any such quotas, duties, tariffs or restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe Trump Administration has advocated for and taken steps toward restricting trade in certain goods, including the imposing of tariffs. Certain inbound products in our Uniforms and Related Products and Promotional Products segments to the United States are subject to these tariffs assessed on the manufactured cost of goods at the time of import. As a result, we have had to increase prices for certain products and may be required to raise those prices further, or raise our prices on other products, which may result in the loss of customers and harm our operating performance. In response, in part, to tariffs levied on products imported from China we have shifted some production out of China and may seek to shift additional production out of China, which may result in additional costs and disruption to our operations. While a \u201cPhase One\u201d agreement on trade was agreed to in January 2020 between China and the United States, most of the tariffs levied remain in effect. It is possible further tariffs will be imposed on imports of our products, that our business will be impacted further by retaliatory trade measures taken by China or other countries in response to existing or future tariffs, or that tariffs in effect will be rescinded or modified.\nThe apparel industry, including uniforms and corporate identity apparel, is subject to changing fashion trends and if we misjudge consumer preferences, the image of one or more of our brands may suffer and the demand for our products may decrease.\nThe apparel industry, including uniforms and corporate identity apparel, is subject to shifting customer demands and evolving fashion trends and our success is also dependent upon our ability to anticipate and promptly respond to these changes. Failure to anticipate, identify or promptly react to changing trends or styles may result in decreased demand for our products, as well as excess inventories and markdowns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if we misjudge consumer preferences, our brand image may be impaired. We believe our products are, in general, less subject to fashion trends compared to many other apparel manufacturers because the majority of what we manufacture and sell are uniforms, scrubs, corporate identity apparel and other accessories.\nOur Remote Staffing Solutions business is dependent on the trend toward outsourcing.\nOur Remote Staffing Solutions business and growth within that segment depend in large part on the industry trend toward outsourced customer contact management services. Outsourcing means that an entity contracts with a third party, such as us, to provide customer contact services rather than perform such services in-house. There can be no assurance that this trend will continue, as organizations may elect to perform such services themselves. A significant change in this trend could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to preserve positive labor relationships with our employees could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur operations rely heavily on our employees, and any labor shortage, disruption or stoppage caused by poor relations with our employees could reduce our operating margins and income. While we believe that our employee relations are good, and very few of our employees are currently subject to collective bargaining agreements, unions have traditionally been active in the U.S. apparel industry. Our workforce has been subject to union organization efforts from time to time, and we could be subject to future unionization efforts as our operations expand. Unionization of our workforce could increase our operating costs or constrain our operating flexibility.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nOur success depends upon the continued protection of our trademarks and other intellectual property rights and we may be forced to incur substantial costs to maintain, defend, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights.\nOur owned intellectual property and certain of our licensed intellectual property have significant value and are instrumental to our ability to market our products. While we own and use several trademarks, our Fashion Seal Healthcare\u00ae and WonderWink\u00ae marks are critically important to our business, as approximately 24% and 19%, respectively, of our Uniform and Related Products segment\u2019s products were sold under those names during the year ended December 31, 2019. We cannot assure that our owned or licensed intellectual property or the operation of our business does not infringe on or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others. We cannot assure that third parties will not assert claims against us on any such basis or that we will be able to successfully resolve such claims. In addition, although we seek international protection of our intellectual property, the laws of some foreign countries do not allow us to protect, defend or enforce our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. We could also incur substantial costs to defend legal actions relating to use of our intellectual property or prosecute legal actions against others using our intellectual property, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. There also can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate and conclude extensions of existing license agreements on similar economic terms or at all.\nOur customers may cancel or decrease the quantity of their orders, which could negatively impact our operating results.\nSales to many of our customers are on an order-by-order basis. If we cannot fill customers\u2019 orders on time, orders may be cancelled and relationships with customers may suffer, which could have an adverse effect on us, especially if the relationship is with a major customer. Furthermore, if any of our customers experience a significant downturn in their business, or fail to remain committed to our programs or brands, the customer may reduce or discontinue purchases from us. The reduction in the amount of our products purchased by customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nIn addition, some of our customers have experienced significant changes and difficulties, including consolidation of ownership, increased centralization of buying decisions, buyer turnover, restructurings, bankruptcies and liquidations. A significant adverse change in a customer relationship or in a customer\u2019s financial position could cause us to limit or discontinue business with that customer, require us to assume more credit risk relating to that customer\u2019s receivables or limit our ability to collect amounts related to previous purchases by that customer, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe pursue acquisitions from time-to-time to expand our business, which may pose risks to our business.\nWe selectively pursue acquisitions from time-to-time as part of our growth strategy. We compete with others within our industries for suitable acquisition candidates. This competition may increase the price for acquisitions and reduce the number of acquisition candidates available to us. As a result, acquisition candidates may not be available to us in the future on favorable terms.\nAcquisition valuations require us to make certain estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of the acquired entities (including the underlying assets and liabilities). If our estimates or assumptions to value the acquired assets and liabilities are not accurate, we may be exposed to losses, and/or unexpected usage of cash flow to fund the operations of the acquired operations that may be material.\nEven if we are able to acquire businesses on favorable terms, managing growth through acquisition is a difficult process that includes integration and training of personnel, combining facility and operating procedures, and additional matters related to the integration of acquired businesses within our existing organization. Unanticipated issues related to integration may result in additional expense and in disruption to our operations, and may require a disproportionate amount of our management\u2019s attention, any of which could negatively impact our ability to achieve anticipated benefits, such as revenue and cost synergies. Growth of our business through acquisition generally increases our operating complexity and the level of responsibility for both existing and new management personnel. Managing and sustaining our growth and expansion may require substantial enhancements to our operational and financial systems and controls, as well as additional administrative, operational and financial resources. We may be required to invest in additional support personnel, facilities and systems to address the increased complexities associated with business or segment expansion. These investments could result in higher overall operating costs and lower operating profits for the business as a whole. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in integrating acquired businesses or managing our expanding operations.\nIn addition, although we conduct due diligence investigations prior to each acquisition, there can be no assurance that we will discover or adequately protect against all material liabilities of an acquired business for which we may be responsible as a successor owner or operator. The failure to identify suitable acquisitions, successfully integrate these acquired businesses, successfully manage our expanding operations, or to discover liabilities associated with such businesses in the diligence process, could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nIn order to finance such acquisitions, we may need to obtain additional funds either through public or private financings, including bank and other secured and unsecured borrowings and/or the issuance of equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that such financings would be available to us on reasonable terms. Any future issuances of equity securities or debt securities with equity features may be dilutive to our shareholders.\nIf our information technology systems suffer interruptions or failures, including as a result of cyber-attacks, our business operations could be disrupted and our reputation could suffer.\nWe rely on information technology systems to process transactions, communicate with customers, manage our business and process and maintain information. The measures we have in place to monitor and protect our information technology systems might not provide sufficient protection from catastrophic events, power surges, viruses, malicious software (including ransomware), attempts to gain unauthorized access to data or other types of cyber-based attacks. As cyber-attacks become more frequent, sophisticated, damaging and difficult to predict, any such event could negatively impact our business operations, such as by product disruptions that result in an unexpected delay in operations, interruptions in our ability to deliver products and services to our customers, loss of confidential or otherwise protected information, corruption of data and expenses related to the repair or replacement of our information technology systems. Compromising and/or loss of information could result in loss of sales or legal or regulatory claims which could adversely affect our revenues and profits or damage our reputation.\nFailure to comply with data privacy and security laws and regulations could adversely affect our operating results and business.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we might collect and store in our internal and external data centers, cloud services and networks sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, as well as personal information of our customers and employees. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. The number and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions that companies have experienced from third parties has increased over the past few years. Despite our security measures, it is impossible for us to eliminate this risk.\nA number of U.S. states have enacted data privacy and security laws and regulations that govern the collection, use, disclosure, transfer, storage, disposal, and protection of personal information, such as social security numbers, financial information and other sensitive personal information. For example, all 50 states and several U.S. territories now have data breach laws that require timely notification to affected individuals, and at times regulators, credit reporting agencies and other bodies, if a company has experienced the unauthorized access or acquisition of certain personal information. Other state laws include the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which was signed into law on June 28, 2018, and took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA, among other things, contains new disclosure obligations for businesses that collect personal information about California residents and affords those individuals new rights relating to their personal information that may affect our ability to collect and/or use personal information. Regulations from the California Attorney General have issued but are not yet final, and it is expected that additional amendments to the CCPA may be introduced in 2020. Meanwhile, several other states and the federal government have considered or are considering privacy laws like the CCPA. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact of these laws, which may impose substantial penalties for violations, impose significant costs for investigations and compliance, allow private class-action litigation and carry significant potential liability for our business.\nOutside of the U.S., data protection laws, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d), also might apply to some of our operations or business partners. Legal requirements in these countries relating to the collection, storage, processing and transfer of personal data/information continue to evolve. The GDPR imposes, among other things, data protection requirements that include strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer EU personal data/information, a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances, and possible substantial fines for any violations (including possible fines for certain violations of up to the greater of 20 million Euros or 4% of total company revenue). Other governmental authorities around the world have enacted or are considering similar types of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection.\nThe interpretation and enforcement of the laws and regulations described above are uncertain and subject to change, and may require substantial costs to monitor and implement and maintain adequate compliance programs. Failure to comply with U.S. and international data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions (which could include substantial civil and/or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business.\nWe are subject to international, federal, national, regional, state, local and other laws and regulations, and failure to comply with them may expose us to potential liability.\nWe are subject to international, federal, national, regional, state, local and other laws and regulations affecting our business, including those promulgated under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Consumer Product Safety Act, the Flammable Fabrics Act, the Textile Fiber Product Identification Act, the rules and regulations of the Consumer Products Safety Commission, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (FCPA), various securities laws and regulations including but not limited to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Securities Exchange Act of 1933, and the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Rules, various labor, workplace and related laws, and environmental laws and regulations. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations may expose us to potential liability and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nShortages of supply of sourced goods or raw materials from suppliers, interruptions in our manufacturing, and local conditions in the countries in which we operate could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe utilize multiple supply sources and manufacturing facilities. However, an unexpected interruption in any of the sources or facilities could temporarily adversely affect our results of operations until alternate sources or facilities can be secured. The Uniform and Related Products segment\u2019s principal fabrics used in the manufacture of its finished goods are cotton, polyester, wool, synthetic and cotton-synthetic blends. The majority of such fabrics are sourced in China. The Promotional Products segment relies on the supply of different types of raw materials, including plastic, glass, fabric and metal. The vast majority of these raw materials are principally sourced from China, either directly by BAMKO or its suppliers. If we are unable to continue to obtain our raw materials and finished products from China or if our suppliers are unable to source raw materials from China, it could significantly disrupt our business. Further, the Company\u2019s suppliers generally source or manufacture finished goods in parts of the world that may be affected by economic uncertainty, political unrest, labor disputes, health emergencies, or the imposition of duties, tariffs or other import regulations by the United States. See also \u201cChanges to trade regulation, quotas, duties, tariffs or other restrictions caused by the changing U.S. and geopolitical environments or otherwise, such as those related to trade with respect to China, may materially harm our revenue and results of operations, such as by increasing our costs and/or limiting the amount of products that we can import.\u201d\nOur business may be impacted by non-performance by manufacturers to whom we made advance payments.\nWe have entered into agreements with manufacturers in which we make payments for raw materials and services in advance of the shipment and delivery of finished products. In the event that advance payments are made to manufacturers that do not have the ability to satisfy their contractual obligations due to their financial instability, geopolitical unrest or other factors, we may incur unrecoverable losses which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business may be impacted by unforeseen or catastrophic events, including the emergence of pandemics or other widespread health emergencies, terrorist attacks, extreme weather events or other natural disasters and other unpredicted events.\nThe occurrence of unforeseen or catastrophic events, such as the emergence of pandemics or other widespread health emergencies (or concerns over the possibility of such pandemics or emergencies), terrorist attacks, extreme weather events or other natural disasters or other unpredicted events, could create economic and financial disruptions, and could lead to operational difficulties (including travel limitations) that could impair our ability to source and supply products and services and manage our businesses, and could negatively impact our customers\u2019 ability or willingness to purchase our products and services.\nFor example, our corporate headquarters is located in Florida, which is a hurricane-sensitive area; should a hurricane occur, the possibly resulting infrastructure damage and disruption to the area could negatively affect our company, such as by damage to or total destruction of our headquarters, surrounding transportation infrastructure, network communications and other forms of communication. Some of our other locations and those of our suppliers, such as those located in the U.S., Central America and Haiti, also are exposed to hurricanes, earthquakes, floods and other extreme weather events; the damage that such events could produce could affect the supply of our products and services.\nAdditionally, while the extent of the impact on our business and financial condition is unknown at this time, we have begun to be negatively affected by actions taken to address and limit the spread of the coronavirus, such as travel restrictions and limitations affecting the supply of labor and the movement of raw materials and finished products. If available manufacturing capacity is reduced as a result of the coronavirus, it could negatively affect the timely supply and pricing of finished products.\nImplementation of technology initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term and fail to provide the anticipated benefits.\nAs our business grows, we continue to make significant investments in our technology, including in the areas of warehouse management, enterprise risk management and product design. The costs, potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of technology initiatives could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term. They may also require us to divert resources from our core business to ensure that implementation is successful. In addition, new or upgraded technology might not provide the anticipated benefits, might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits, might fail or might cost more than anticipated.\nInability to attract and retain key management or other personnel could adversely impact our business.\nOur success is largely dependent on the skills, experience and efforts of our senior management and other key personnel. If, for any reason, one or more senior executive or key personnel was not to remain active in our company, or if we were unable to attract and retain senior management or key personnel, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nFailure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could adversely affect our business and stock price.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the consolidated financial statement preparation and presentation. While we continue to evaluate our internal controls, we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting in the future. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm were to discover material weaknesses in our internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could cause us to be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud. This may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price.\nWe may recognize impairment charges, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe assess our goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets for impairment when required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d). These accounting principles require that we record an impairment charge if circumstances indicate that the asset carrying values exceed their estimated fair values. The estimated fair value of these assets is impacted by general economic conditions in the locations in which we operate. Deterioration in these general economic conditions may result in: declining revenue, which can lead to excess capacity and declining operating cash flow; reductions in management\u2019s estimates for future revenue and operating cash flow growth; increases in borrowing rates and other deterioration in factors that impact our weighted average cost of capital; and deteriorating real estate values. If our assessment of goodwill, intangible assets or long-lived assets indicates an impairment of the carrying value for which we recognize an impairment charge, this may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to accurately predict our future tax liabilities, become subject to increased levels of taxation or our tax contingencies are unfavorably resolved, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIn 2017, the United States adopted tax reform legislation commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which imposed a new tax on our non-U.S. operations. The U.S. tax changes also provided flexibility related to repatriating non-U.S. earnings to the United States without additional U.S. taxation, and as a result, we changed classification of certain earnings that were previously deemed to be permanently reinvested offshore and recorded deferred tax liabilities for the associated withholding taxes. Other changes in tax laws or regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business, including the United States, or changes in how the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act or other tax laws are interpreted, could further impact our effective tax rate, further restrict our ability to repatriate undistributed offshore earnings, or impose new restrictions, costs or prohibitions on our current practices and reduce our net income and adversely affect our cash flows.\nWe are also subject to tax audits in the United States and other jurisdictions and our tax positions may be challenged by tax authorities. Although we believe that our current tax provisions are reasonable and appropriate, there can be no assurance that these items will be settled for the amounts accrued, that additional tax exposures will not be identified in the future or that additional tax reserves will not be necessary for any such exposures. Any increase in the amount of taxation incurred as a result of challenges to our tax filing positions could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to periodic litigation in both domestic and international jurisdictions that may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nFrom time-to-time we may be involved in legal or regulatory actions regarding product liability, employment practices, intellectual property infringement, bankruptcies and other litigation or enforcement matters. These proceedings may be in jurisdictions with reputations for aggressive application of laws and procedures against corporate defendants. We are impacted by trends in litigation, including class-action allegations brought under various consumer protection and employment laws. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation in both domestic and foreign jurisdictions, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. These proceedings could cause us to incur costs and may require us to devote resources to defend against these claims and could ultimately result in a loss or other remedies, such as product recalls, which could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Indebtedness and Pension Obligations\nOur indebtedness may limit cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our business.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our total consolidated indebtedness was $119.8 million. Our outstanding indebtedness may have negative consequences on our business, such as requiring us to dedicate a sizable portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of debt service, reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends, stock buybacks and other general corporate purposes, and increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions.\nOur credit agreement contains restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nOur senior secured credit agreement contains various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit our and our restricted subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things:\n\u2022 incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares;\n\u2022 pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of our capital stock, or make other restricted payments;\n\u2022 make certain investments;\n\u2022 sell certain assets;\n\u2022 acquire other businesses;\n\u2022 create liens;\n\u2022 consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022 enter into certain transactions with our affiliates.\nSubstantially all of the assets of the Company are pledged as collateral under our indebtedness. Our credit agreement requires compliance with certain financial ratios and covenants and satisfaction of specified financial tests. Failure to meet any financial ratios, covenants or financial tests could result in an event of default under our credit agreement. If an event of default occurs, our lender could increase our borrowing costs, restrict our ability to obtain additional borrowings under our line of credit, accelerate all amounts outstanding or enforce its interest against collateral pledged under the credit agreement.\nPotential transition from LIBOR as a benchmark borrowing rate.\nOn July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the \u201cFCA\u201d), which regulates the London interbank offered rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), announced that the FCA will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. This announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis is not guaranteed after 2021, and LIBOR may be discontinued or modified by 2021.\nInterest rates on the Company\u2019s current debt instruments are benchmarked against LIBOR. These debt instruments mature after December 31, 2021, which is the date at which banks are expected to stop reporting the data used to create this benchmark reference rate. While there is a general industry expectation that a new benchmark rate known as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) will be used instead, it is uncertain how many or which industry participants will switch from one benchmark rate to another or whether a benchmark other than SOFR will become prevalent. Further, the Company\u2019s debt instruments do not currently identify an alternative benchmark rate to replace LIBOR, leaving such determination to the lender\u2019s reasonable discretion, nor is the impact of such a change determinable. The transition to SOFR or any other benchmark rate may impact interest rates on the Company\u2019s borrowings, including its corporate debt and interest-rate swap. If the impact is significantly adverse, the Company\u2019s ability to service its debt or comply with its debt covenants could be jeopardized.\nFurther, a change from LIBOR to another indexed benchmark rate may affect companies or individuals with exposure to LIBOR with whom the Company relies upon to conduct business, such as its current banking institutions, vendors, customers, brokers/dealers, investment companies or investment advisors. Adverse impacts on any market participants on whom the Company relies to conduct business or access capital markets could significantly affect the Company\u2019s business operations and cash flow.\nWe have significant pension obligations with respect to our employees and our available cash flow may be adversely affected in the event that payments become due under any pension plans that are unfunded or underfunded.\nA portion of our active and retired employees participate in defined benefit pension plans under which we are obligated to provide prescribed levels of benefits regardless of the value of the underlying assets, if any, of the applicable pension plan. If our obligations under a plan are unfunded or underfunded, we will have to use cash flow from operations and other sources to pay our obligations either as they become due or over some shorter funding period. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $10.4 million in unfunded or underfunded obligations related to our pension plans, compared to $8.8 million as of December 31, 2018.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nCertain existing shareholders have significant control.\nAt December 31, 2019, our executive officers and Directors, and certain of their family members collectively owned 35.6% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, our executive officers and Directors, and certain of their family members have significant influence over the election of our Board of Directors, the approval or disapproval of any other matters requiring shareholder approval, and the affairs and policies of our company.\nOur share price may change significantly, and you may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid or at all, and you could lose all or part of your investment as a result.\nThe trading price of our common stock, as reported on the Nasdaq Stock Market, could fluctuate due to a number of factors such as those listed in \u201cRisks Relating to Our Business\u201d and include, but are not limited to, the following, some of which are beyond our control:\n\u2022 quarterly variations in our results of operations;\n\u2022 results of operations that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022 results of operations that vary from those of our competitors;\n\u2022 changes in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022 announcements by us, our competitors or our vendors of significant contracts, acquisitions, divestitures, joint marketing relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022 announcements by third parties of significant claims or proceedings against us; and\n\u2022 general domestic and international economic conditions.\nFurthermore, the stock market has experienced extreme volatility that, in some cases, has been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nIn the past, following periods of market volatility, shareholders have instituted securities class action litigation. If we were involved in securities litigation, it could have a substantial cost and divert resources and the attention of executive management from our business regardless of the outcome of such litigation.\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock, and our indebtedness could limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock.\nPayment of cash dividends on our common stock is subject to our compliance with applicable law and depends on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, level of indebtedness, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, business prospects and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. Our senior credit facility contains, and the terms of any future indebtedness we incur may contain, limitations on our ability to pay dividends. Although we have paid cash dividends in the past, there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay any dividend in the future.", "PERMNO": 47861, "SIC": 2300, "TIC": "SGC"}
