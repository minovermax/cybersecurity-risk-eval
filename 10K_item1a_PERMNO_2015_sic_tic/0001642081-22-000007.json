{"cik": "1642081", "company": "Allegiance Bancshares, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-25", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock involves risks. The following is a description of the material risks and uncertainties that we believe affect our business and an investment in our common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently deem immaterial, also may become important factors that affect the Company and our business. If any of the risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K were to occur, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. In such an event, the value of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to the Pending Merger with CBTX\nThe consummation of the merger is contingent upon the satisfaction of a number of conditions, including shareholder and regulatory approvals, that may be outside of the Company\u2019s or CBTX\u2019s control and that the Company and CBTX may be unable to satisfy or obtain or which may delay the consummation of the merger or result in the imposition of conditions that could reduce the anticipated benefits from the merger or cause the parties to abandon the merger.\nWe face risks and uncertainties related to the proposed merger with CBTX. Before the transactions contemplated in the merger agreement with CBTX can be completed, approvals must be obtained from regulatory authorities, including the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the Texas Department of Banking, and from our shareholders and CBTX\u2019s shareholders, and all conditions to the closing of the transaction included in the merger agreement must have been satisfied or waived. The required regulatory approvals may impose additional conditions, limitations, obligations or costs on the surviving entity, place restrictions on the conduct of the business of the surviving entity or require changes to the terms of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. There can be no assurance that our or CBTX\u2019s regulators will not impose any such additional conditions, limitations, obligations or restrictions, or that they will not have the effect of delaying or preventing the completion of the merger, imposing additional material costs on or materially limiting the revenues of the surviving entity following the merger or otherwise reducing the anticipated benefits of the\nmerger.Additionally, the surviving entity will be subject to increased regulatory requirements due to its increased asset size, and the ultimate effect of compliance with those expectations is not yet known.\nUncertainties about the effects of the merger, including reputational risk, may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is consummated and for a period of time thereafter, and could cause customers and others who work with us to seek to change their existing business relationships with us. It is not unusual for competitors to use mergers as an opportunity to target the merging parties\u2019 customers and to hire certain of their employees. Employee retention may be particularly challenging during the pendency of the merger, as employees may experience uncertainty about their roles with the surviving entity following the merger.\nThe merger agreement contains provisions that restrict each company's ability to, among other things, initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate, inquiries or proposals with respect to, or, subject to certain exceptions generally related to its board of directors\u2019 exercise of fiduciary duties, engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential information relating to, any alternative acquisition proposals. These provisions, which include a $32.5 million termination fee payable under certain circumstances, may discourage any potential competing third party having an interest in merging with us from proposing a transaction, or may result in the offer of a lower per share price to merge with us than might otherwise have been proposed.\nWe may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the merger, or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected. We may also encounter significant difficulties in integrating with CBTX. We and CBTX have operated, and until the completion of the merger will continue to operate, independently, subject to terms of the merger agreement imposing specific limitations on certain actions of each party without the consent of the other party. A significant portion of the anticipated benefit of the merger is attributable to anticipated cost savings from the integration of the two companies and elimination of duplicated costs and business functions. There is no assurance that our businesses can be integrated successfully or that the expected cost reductions can be realized. The integration process may result in the loss of key employees of each company, the loss of customers, reputational harm, the disruption of each company\u2019s ongoing business, inconsistencies in standards, controls, policies and procedures, unexpected integration issues, higher than expected integration costs and an overall post-completion integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated. If we experience difficulties in the integration process, including those listed in the prior sentence, we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger in a timely manner or at all. The success of the merger will depend on, among other things, the ability of the surviving entity following the merger to operate its businesses in a manner that facilitates growth and realizes cost savings.\nThe merger agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the merger may not be completed. The merger agreement is subject to a number of conditions which must be fulfilled in order to complete the merger, including the approval of the merger agreement by the Company\u2019s and CBTX\u2019s respective shareholders; the receipt of authorization for listing on the Nasdaq of the shares of CBTX common stock to be issued in the merger; the receipt of all required regulatory approvals; the effectiveness of the registration statement on Form S-4 for the CBTX common stock to be issued in the merger; the absence of any order, injunction, decree or other legal restraint preventing the completion of the merger or making the completion of the merger illegal; subject to certain exceptions, the accuracy of the representations and warranties under the merger agreement; our and CBTX\u2019s performance in all material respects of our and their respective obligations under the merger agreement; and each of our and CBTX\u2019s receipt of a tax opinion to the effect that the merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The conditions to the closing of the merger included in the merger agreement may not be fulfilled in a timely manner or at all, and, accordingly, the merger may be delayed or may not be completed.\nWe and CBTX may elect to terminate the merger agreement under certain circumstances. Among other situations, if the merger is not completed by August 2, 2022, either we or CBTX may choose not to proceed with the merger (unless the failure of the closing to occur by such date was due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate the merger agreement to perform or observe the obligations, covenants and agreements of such party set forth in the merger agreement). We and CBTX can also mutually decide to terminate the merger agreement at any time. If the merger agreement is terminated, under certain circumstances, we may be required to pay a termination fee of $32.5 million to CBTX.\nThe value to be recognized by our shareholders from the merger is subject to material uncertainties. The merger agreement provides that upon the closing of the merger our shareholders will receive 1.4184 shares of CBTX common stock for each share of our common stock that they own at that time. The exchange rate for the conversion of our common stock into CBTX common stock was set in early November 2021 based upon information available to the boards of directors and financial advisors of each company at that time. The market price of our common stock and of CBTX common stock is subject to substantial fluctuations in response to variety of factors that are inherently unpredictable and outside of our control, including changes in our and CBTX\u2019s business, operations and prospects, and regulatory considerations, the historical and anticipated future financial results of our respective banking operations and general market and economic developments affecting Texas, the United States and international businesses and financial markets. The substantial differences between our business and the business of CBTX will subject our shareholders to new and different risks than\nthose with which they are familiar. A period of months may transpire between the date that our shareholders are asked to approve the merger and the date that the merger is consummated, during which time the value of the merger consideration received by our shareholders will continue to fluctuate. As a result, at the time of our special meeting of shareholders to vote to approve the merger agreement, our shareholders will not until the closing of the merger know the precise value of the merger consideration they will receive, which could be materially different than the market value at the time of the merger vote and the market value at the time the exchange ratio was set.\nFailure to complete the proposed merger with CBTX could negatively impact our business, financial results and stock price. If the proposed merger is not completed for any reason, our ongoing business may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the merger, we would be subject to a number of related risks, including the following:\n\u2022we may be required, under certain circumstances, to pay CBTX a termination fee of $32.5 million under the merger agreement, which may adversely affect the price of our common stock;\n\u2022we will have incurred substantial expenses and will be required to pay significant costs relating to the merger, whether or not it is completed, such as legal, accounting, due diligence, financial advisor and printing fees;\n\u2022the merger agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to completion of the merger, which may adversely affect our ability to execute certain of our business strategies and cause certain other initiatives to be delayed or abandoned;\n\u2022matters relating to the merger require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management team that could have been and could be devoted to the pursuit of other opportunities beneficial to us as an independent company; and\n\u2022we may be subject to negative reactions from the financial markets and from our customers and employees that could materially affect our business, financial results and stock price; the market price of our common stock could decline to the extent that current market prices of our common stock reflect a market assumption that the merger will be completed.\nLitigation could prevent or delay the closing of the proposed merger or otherwise negatively impact our business and operations. We may be subject to legal proceedings related to the agreed terms of the proposed merger, the manner in which the merger was considered and approved by our board of directors or any failure to complete the merger or perform our obligations under the merger agreement. Such litigation could delay or block the consummation of the merger, have an adverse effect on our financial condition and impose material costs on us or the surviving entity. Any delay in completing the merger could cause us not to realize, or to be delayed in realizing, some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve if the merger is successfully completed within its expected time frame.\nThe surviving entity\u2019s future results will suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations following the merger. Following the merger, the size of our business will increase significantly beyond its current size. The future success of the surviving entity depends, in part, upon the ability to manage this expanded business and the increased regulatory requirements, which will pose substantial challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity. There can be no assurances the surviving entity will be successful or that it will realize the expected operating efficiencies, cost savings and other benefits currently anticipated from the merger.\nRisks Related to our Business\nThe COVID-19 pandemic's impact on our business will depend on future developments, which remain uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities, employees and customers in response to the pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to create extensive disruptions to the global economy and to the lives of individuals throughout the world. Governments, businesses and the public have taken unprecedented actions to contain the spread of COVID-19 and to mitigate its effects, including quarantines, travel bans, shelter-in-place orders, closures of businesses and schools, fiscal stimulus and legislation designed to deliver monetary aid and other relief. While the scope, duration and full effects of the pandemic are rapidly evolving and not fully known, the pandemic and related efforts to contain it have disrupted global economic activity, adversely affected the functioning of financial markets, impacted interest rates, increased economic and market uncertainty and disrupted trade and supply chains. If these effects continue for a prolonged period or result in sustained economic stress or recession, many of the risk factors identified in this Form 10-K could be exacerbated and such effects could have a material adverse impact on us\nin a number of ways related to credit, collateral, capital, customer demand, funding, liquidity, operations, interest rate risk, human capital and self-insurance.\nKey employees and members of their households could become sick from COVID-19, and current and future restrictions on how we operate our bank offices and operational departments could limit our ability to meet customer service expectations and have a material adverse effect on our operations. Additionally, in order to reduce the spread of COVID-19, we have modified our business practices with a portion of our employees working remotely from their homes. As a result, some employees may not choose to return to working full time from the office or may decide to leave the workforce all together, which could adversely affect our business and operations. The continuation of these work-from-home measures also introduces additional operational risk, including that technology in employees\u2019 homes may not be as robust as in our offices and could cause the networks, information systems, applications and other tools available to employees to be more limited or less reliable than in our offices. Increased cybersecurity risk includes increased phishing, malware and other cybersecurity attacks, vulnerability to disruptions of our information technology infrastructure and telecommunications systems for remote operations, increased risk of unauthorized dissemination of confidential information, limited ability to restore the systems in the event of a systems failure or interruption, greater risk of a security breach resulting in destruction or misuse of valuable information and potential impairment of our ability to perform critical functions, including wiring funds, all of which could expose us to risks of data or financial loss, litigation and liability and could seriously disrupt our operations.\nOur business concentration in Texas, specifically in the Houston region, imposes risks and may magnify the consequences of any regional or local economic downturn affecting Houston, including any downturn in the energy or real estate sectors.\nWe conduct our operations almost exclusively in the Houston region. As of December 31, 2021, the substantial majority of the loans in our loan portfolio were made to borrowers who live and/or conduct business in Texas, and specifically, in the Houston region, and the substantial majority of our secured loans were secured by collateral located in the Houston region. Accordingly, we are significantly exposed to risks associated with a lack of geographic diversification. The economic conditions in the Houston region are dependent on the energy sector generally and the price of oil and gas specifically. Any downturn or adverse development in the energy sector or continued volatility of oil or gas prices could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. Adverse economic developments, among other things, could negatively affect the volume of loan originations, increase the level of nonperforming assets and charge-offs, increase the rate of foreclosure losses on loans and reduce the value of our loans and loan servicing portfolio. While crude oil prices increased in 2021 relative to 2020, they remained volatile throughout the end of 2021. Any regional or local economic downturn that affects the Houston region or Texas more generally, or our existing borrowers, prospective borrowers or property values in the Company\u2019s market area may affect our profitability more significantly and more adversely than those of our competitors with operations that are less geographically concentrated in the same area.\nWe may not be able to implement aspects of our growth strategy, which may affect our ability to maintain our historical earnings trends.\nThe Company\u2019s growth strategy focuses on organic growth, supplemented by strategic acquisitions. The Company may not be able to execute on aspects of its growth strategy to sustain its historical rate of growth or may not be able to grow at all. More specifically, the Company may not be able to generate sufficient new loans and deposits within acceptable risk and expense tolerances, obtain the personnel or funding necessary for additional growth or find suitable acquisition candidates. Various factors, such as economic conditions, the volatility of oil and gas prices and, in particular, competition, may impede or prohibit the growth of the Company\u2019s operations, the opening of new branches and the consummation of additional acquisitions. Further, the Company may be unable to attract and retain experienced bankers, which could adversely affect its growth. The success of the Company\u2019s growth strategy also depends on its ability to effectively manage growth, which is dependent upon a number of factors, including the Company\u2019s ability to adapt its existing credit, operational, technology and governance infrastructure to accommodate expanded operations. If the Company fails to implement one or more aspects of its growth strategy, the Company may be unable to maintain its historical earnings trends, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the future effects of COVID-19 on economic activity could negatively affect the future banking products we provide, including a decline in the origination of loans.\nOur ability to retain bankers and recruit additional successful bankers is critical to the success of our business strategy and any failure to do so could impair our customer relationships and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur ability to retain and grow our loans, deposits and fee income depends upon the business generation capabilities, reputation and the relationship management skills of our bankers. If we were to lose the services of any of our bankers, including\nsuccessful bankers employed by an acquired bank, to a competitor or otherwise, the Company may not be able to retain valuable relationships and some of our customers could choose to use the services of a competitor instead of our services. Furthermore, our ability to replace our current bankers as they age-out of the workforce is limited by the number of qualified applicants available.\nOur success and growth strategy also depends on our continued ability to attract and retain experienced loan officers and support staff, as well as other management personnel, including our ability to replace our current loan officers, staff and personnel as they age-out of the workforce. The Company may face difficulties in recruiting and retaining bankers and other personnel of our desired caliber, including as a result of staffing shortages and competition from other financial institutions. Competition for loan officers and other personnel is strong and the Company may not be successful in attracting or retaining the personnel it requires. In particular, many of our competitors are significantly larger with greater financial resources, and may be able to offer more attractive compensation packages and broader career opportunities. Furthermore, our current and potential new personnel may prefer and seek jobs where they can work fully remote. Additionally, the Company may incur significant expenses and expend significant time and resources on training, integration and business development before it is able to determine whether a new loan officer will be profitable or effective. If we are unable to attract and retain successful loan officers and other personnel, or if our loan officers and other personnel fail to meet our expectations in terms of customer relationships and profitability, we may be unable to execute our business strategy and our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects may be negatively affected.\nWe are dependent on our executive officers and other key individuals to continue the implementation of our long-term business strategy and the loss of one or more of these key individuals could curtail our growth and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur continued success depends in large part upon the skills, experience and continued service of our executive management team and Board of Directors. Our goals, strategies and continued growth are closely tied to the strengths and banking philosophy of our executive management team, including our Chief Executive Officer, Steven F. Retzloff, and our President, Ramon A. Vitulli, III. Successful implementation of our business strategy is also dependent in part on the continued service of our bank office presidents. The community involvement and diverse and extensive local business relationships and experience in the Houston market of our officers in the Houston region are important to our success. The loss of services of any of these key personnel in the future could have a negative impact on our business because of their skills, years of industry experience and it may be difficult to find qualified replacement personnel who are experienced in the specialized aspects of our business or who have ties to the communities within our market area. Currently, it is generally our policy to utilize employment agreements only in connection with merger or acquisition activities and not to have long-term employment agreements with our officers. While the Company does not anticipate any changes in our executive management team, the unexpected loss of any of these members of management could have a material adverse effect on the Company and our ability to implement our business strategy.\nA key piece of our strategic growth plan involves decision-making authority at the bank office level, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be negatively affected if our local teams do not follow our internal policies or are negligent in their decision-making.\nWe attract and retain our management talent by empowering them to make certain business decisions on a local level. Lending authorities are assigned to bank office presidents and their banking teams based on their level of experience. Additionally, all loan relationships in excess of internal specified maximums are reviewed by a senior level loan committee, comprised of senior management of the Bank. Our local bankers may not follow our internal procedures or otherwise act in our best interests with respect to our decision-making. A failure of our employees to follow our internal policies, or actions taken by our employees that are negligent, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur strategic growth plan, which includes pursuing acquisitions, could expose the Company to financial, execution and operational risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nThe Company has acquired three financial institutions and one branch and intends to continue to pursue a strategy that includes future acquisitions. An acquisition strategy involves significant risks, including the following:\n\u2022discovering proper candidates for acquisition;\n\u2022incurring time and expense associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and negotiating potential transactions, resulting in management\u2019s attention being diverted from the operation of our existing business;\n\u2022using inaccurate estimates and judgments to evaluate credit, operations, management, compliance and market risks with respect to the target institution or assets;\n\u2022conducting adequate due diligence and managing known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including compliance and legal matters;\n\u2022obtaining necessary regulatory approvals;\n\u2022integrating the operations and personnel of the combined businesses, thereby creating an adverse short-term effect on results of operations;\n\u2022attracting and retaining qualified management and key personnel, including bankers;\n\u2022maintaining asset quality;\n\u2022attracting and retaining customers;\n\u2022attracting funding to support additional growth within acceptable risk tolerances; and\n\u2022maintaining adequate regulatory capital.\nThe market for acquisition targets is highly competitive, which may adversely affect our ability to find acquisition candidates that fit our strategy and standards. To the extent that we are unable to find suitable acquisition targets, an important component of our growth strategy may not be realized. Acquisitions of financial institutions involve operational risks and uncertainties, such as unknown or contingent liabilities with no available manner of recourse, exposure to unexpected problems such as asset quality, the retention of key employees and customers and other issues that could negatively affect our business. Acquisitions of financial institutions are also subject to regulatory approvals that can result in delays, which in some cases could be for a lengthy period of time or may not be received. The Company may not be able to complete future acquisitions or, if completed, the Company may not be able to successfully integrate the operations, technology platforms, management, products and services of the entities that it acquires or effectively eliminate redundancies. The integration process may also require significant time and attention from our management that would otherwise be directed toward servicing existing business and developing new business. Further, acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values and, therefore, some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future acquisition, and the goodwill that the Company currently maintains or may recognize in connection with future transactions may be subject to impairment in future periods.\nChallenging market conditions and economic trends have adversely affected the banking industry and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are a business operating in the challenging and uncertain financial services environment. The success of our business and operations is sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the U.S. and locally in our industry and market. If the U.S. economy weakens, whether due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, and a lack of growth in population, income levels, deposits and business investment in our local market occurs, our growth and profitability from our lending, deposit and asset management services could be constrained. Financial institutions continue to be affected by volatility in the real estate market in some parts of the country and uncertain regulatory and interest rate conditions. The Company has direct exposure to the residential and commercial real estate market in Texas, particularly in the Houston region, and could be affected by these events.\nUncertain market and economic conditions can make our ability to assess the creditworthiness of customers and estimate the losses in our loan portfolio more complex. Current inflationary trends, if sustained for an extended period of time, could have a negative impact on customers' businesses. Another national economic recession or continued deterioration of conditions in our market could drive losses beyond that which is provided for in our allowance for credit losses and result in the following consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business:\n\u2022loan delinquencies may rise;\n\u2022nonperforming assets and foreclosures may increase;\n\u2022demand for our products and services may decline; and\n\u2022collateral securing our loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, which could reduce customers\u2019 borrowing power and repayment ability.\nLow and volatile oil and gas prices can have an adverse impact on economic conditions in the U.S. generally and in the Houston region specifically. Declines in real estate values, declines in the volume of home sales and financial stress on borrowers as a result of low oil and gas prices, including job losses, may have an adverse effect on our borrowers and their customers, which may\nadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The future effects of COVID-19 on economic activity could negatively affect the collateral values associated with our existing loans, our ability to liquidate the real estate collateral securing our residential and commercial real estate loans, our ability to maintain loan origination volume and to obtain additional financing, the future demand for or profitability of our lending and services and the financial condition and credit risk of our customers. Further, in the event of delinquencies, regulatory changes and policies designed to protect borrowers may slow or prevent us from making our business decisions or may result in a delay in our taking certain remediation actions, such as foreclosure. In addition, we have unfunded commitments to extend credit to customers. During challenging economic environments, our customers are more dependent on our credit commitments and increased borrowings under these commitments could adversely impact our liquidity.\nThe small to medium-sized businesses that the Company lends to may have fewer resources to weather adverse business developments, which may impair a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a loan, and such impairment could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe focus our business development and marketing strategy primarily on small to medium-sized businesses, which we categorize as commercial borrowing relationships of generally less than $8 million of exposure. Small to medium-sized businesses frequently have a smaller market share than their competition, may be more vulnerable to economic downturns, often need substantial additional capital to expand or compete and may experience substantial volatility in operating results, any of which may impair a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a loan. In addition, the success of a small or medium-sized business often depends on the management skills, talents and efforts of one or two people or a small group of people, and the death, disability or resignation of one or more of these people could have a material adverse impact on the business and its ability to repay our loan. If general economic conditions negatively impact the Houston region or Texas and small to medium-sized businesses are adversely affected, or our borrowers are otherwise affected by adverse business developments, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected.\nIf our allowance for credit losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings may be affected.\nThe allowance for credit losses is a valuation allowance for current expected credit losses. We establish our allowance for credit losses and maintain it at a level management considers adequate to absorb expected loan losses in our loan portfolio. The allowance for credit losses represents our estimate of probable losses in the portfolio at each balance sheet date and is based upon relevant information available to us, such as past loan loss experience, the nature and volume of the portfolio, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, economic conditions and other factors. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited back to the allowance. Our allowance for credit losses consists of a general component based upon expected losses in the portfolio and a specific component based on individual loans that are individually evaluated. In determining the collectability of certain loans, management also considers the fair value of any underlying collateral. The amount ultimately realized may differ from the carrying value of these assets because of economic, operating or other conditions beyond our control, and any such differences may be material.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our allowance for credit losses on loans was $47.9 million, which represented 1.14% of our total loans and 198.70% of our total nonperforming loans. As of December 31, 2020, our allowance for loan losses was $53.2 million, which represented 1.18% of our total loans and 184.03% of our total nonperforming loans as of the same date. Additional loan losses will likely occur in the future and may occur at a rate greater than the Company has previously experienced. We may be required to take additional provisions for loan losses in the future to further supplement the allowance for credit losses, either due to results of the allowance for credit losses model or as required by our banking regulators. In addition, federal and state bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for credit losses and the value attributed to nonaccrual loans or to real estate acquired through foreclosure. Such regulatory agencies may require the Company to recognize future charge-offs. Their conclusions about the quality of a particular borrower or our entire loan portfolio may be different than ours. Any increase in our allowance for credit losses or loan charge offs as required by these regulatory agencies could have a negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic and real estate market conditions, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans, accounting rule changes (like those related to CECL which became effective on January 1, 2020) and other factors, both within and outside of our management\u2019s control. These additions may require increased provision expense which would negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe acquisition method of accounting requires that acquired loans are initially recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition, which includes an estimate of loan losses expected to be realized over the remaining lives of the loans, and therefore no corresponding allowance for credit losses is recorded for these loans at acquisition because credit quality, among other elements, was\nconsidered in the determination of fair value. To the extent that our estimates of fair value are too high, it will incur losses associated with the acquired loans.\nAs a significant percentage of our loan portfolio is comprised of real estate loans, an adverse change in the economic conditions of the real estate market where we operate could affect real estate values and may result in losses to our business.\nAs of December 31, 2021, $3.35 billion, or 79.3%, of our total loans was comprised of loans with real estate as a primary or secondary component of collateral. The real estate collateral provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value over the term of the loan, limiting our ability to realize the full value of the collateral anticipated at the time of the originating loan. A weakening of the real estate market in our primary market area could have an adverse effect on the demand for new loans, the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, the value of real estate and other collateral securing the loans and the value of our business. In addition, the volatility of the real estate market may result in a lower valuation at the time collateral is put on the market for sale. Collateral may have to be sold for less than the outstanding balance of the loan, which could result in losses on such loans. Such declines and losses in real estate values may cause the Company to experience increases in provisions for loan losses and charge-offs, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nOur commercial real estate and construction, land development and other land loan portfolios expose us to credit risks that may be greater than the risks related to other types of loans.\nAs of December 31, 2021, $2.10 billion, or 49.9%, of our total loans were comprised of commercial real estate loans (including owner-occupied commercial real estate loans) and $439.1 million, or 10.4%, of our total loans were comprised of construction, land development and other land loans. Commercial real estate loans generally involve relatively large balances to single borrowers or related groups of borrowers. Repayment of these loans is typically dependent upon income generated, or expected to be generated, by the property securing the loan in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service. The availability of such income for repayment may be adversely affected by changes in the economy or local market conditions. These loans expose a lender to greater credit risk than loans secured by other types of collateral because the collateral securing these loans is typically more difficult to liquidate due to the fluctuation of real estate values. Unexpected deterioration in the credit quality of our commercial real estate loan portfolio could require us to increase our allowance for credit losses, which would reduce our profitability and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nReal estate construction, land development and other similar land loans involve risks attributable to the fact that loan funds are secured by a project under construction, and the project is of uncertain value prior to our completion. These risks include:\n\u2022the viability of the contractor:\n\u2022the value of the project being subject to successful completion;\n\u2022the contractor\u2019s ability to complete the project, to meet deadlines and time schedules and to stay within our estimates; and\n\u2022concentration of such loans with a single contractor and our affiliates.\nReal estate construction lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent, in part, on the success of the ultimate project rather than the ability of a borrower or guarantor to repay the loan and also presents risks of default in the event of declines in property values or volatility in the real estate market during the construction phase. If we are forced to foreclose on a project prior to completion, we may be unable to recover the entire unpaid portion of the loan. In addition, we may be required to fund additional amounts to complete a project and may have to hold the property for an indeterminate period of time, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA large portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of commercial and industrial loans secured by receivables, inventory, equipment or other commercial collateral, the deterioration in value of which could increase the potential for future losses.\nAs of December 31, 2021, $693.6 million, or 16.4%, of our total loans were comprised of commercial and industrial loans that are typically based on the borrowers\u2019 ability to repay the loans from the cash flow of their businesses. These loans may involve greater risk because the availability of funds to repay each loan depends substantially on the success of the borrower\u2019s business itself and these loans are typically larger in amount, which creates the potential for larger losses on a single loan basis. Commercial and industrial loans are collateralized by general business assets including, among other things, accounts receivable, inventory and equipment and are generally backed by a personal guaranty of the borrower or principal. This collateral may decline in value more rapidly than the Company anticipates, exposing it to increased credit risk. In addition, a portion of our customer base, including customers in the energy and real estate business, may be in industries which are particularly sensitive to commodity prices or market\nfluctuations, such as energy and real estate prices. Accordingly, negative changes in commodity prices and real estate values and liquidity could impair the value of the collateral securing these loans. Significant adverse changes in the economy or local market conditions in which our commercial lending customers operate could cause rapid declines in loan collectability and the values associated with general business assets resulting in inadequate collateral coverage that may expose the Company to credit losses and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur SBA lending program, which includes the Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d), is dependent upon the federal government and our status as a participant in the SBA\u2019s Preferred Lenders Program, and a failure to originate SBA loans in compliance with SBA guidelines could result in losses on the guaranteed portion of our SBA loans.\nWe have been approved by the Small Business Administration, or SBA, to participate in the SBA\u2019s Preferred Lenders Program. As an SBA Preferred Lender, we enable our clients to obtain SBA loans without being subject to the potentially lengthy SBA approval process necessary for lenders who are not SBA Preferred Lenders. The SBA periodically reviews the lending operations of participating lenders to assess, among other things, whether the lender exhibits prudent risk management. When weaknesses are identified, the SBA may request corrective actions or impose enforcement actions, including revocation of the lender\u2019s Preferred Lender status. If we lose our status as an SBA Preferred Lender, we may lose some or all of our customers to lenders who are SBA Preferred Lenders, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn an effort to support our communities during the COVID-19 pandemic, we participated in the SBA\u2019s new 7(a) loan program called the PPP by making loans to small businesses that are subject to the terms and conditions of the PPP. We face increased risks related to non-compliance by us with this new legislation and by borrowers with the terms of the PPP. Additionally, we face risk on PPP loans if there is a deficiency in the manner in which the loan was originated, funded or serviced by us, such as an issue with the eligibility of a borrower to receive a PPP loan or the amount of such loan, which may or may not be related to the ambiguity in the laws, rules and guidance regarding the operation of the PPP. If the SBA determines there is a deficiency, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty, or, if it has already paid under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from us. If borrowers under PPP loans fail to qualify for loan forgiveness, we are at the heightened risk of holding such loans at unfavorable interest rates with no collateral and no guarantors. Through our participation in the PPP, as of December 31, 2021, we had funded over 10,000 PPP loans in excess of $1.08 billion.\nAs of December 31, 2021, SBA 7(a) and 504 program loans of $205.6 million comprised 4.9% of our loan portfolio, and we intend to grow this segment of our portfolio in the future. PPP loans notwithstanding, SBA lending programs typically guarantee 75.0% of the principal on an underlying loan. If the SBA establishes that a loss on an SBA-guaranteed loan is attributable to significant technical deficiencies in the manner in which the loan was originated, funded or serviced by us, the SBA may seek recovery of the principal loss related to the deficiency from us notwithstanding that a portion of the loan was guaranteed by the SBA, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we follow the SBA\u2019s underwriting guidelines, our ability to do so depends on the knowledge and diligence of our employees and the effectiveness of controls we have established. If our employees do not follow the SBA guidelines in originating loans and if our loan review and audit programs fail to identify and rectify such failures, the SBA may reduce or, in some cases, refuse to honor its guarantee obligations and we may incur losses as a result.\nThe laws, regulations and standard operating procedures that are applicable to SBA loan products may change in the future. We cannot predict the effects of these changes on our business and profitability. Because government regulation greatly affects the business and financial results of all commercial banks and bank holding companies, including our organization, changes in the laws, regulations and procedures applicable to SBA loans could adversely affect our ability to operate profitably. In addition, the aggregate amount of all SBA 7(a) and 504 loan guarantees by the SBA must be approved each fiscal year by the federal government. We cannot predict the amount of SBA 7(a) loan guarantees in any given fiscal year. If the federal government were to reduce the amount of SBA loan guarantees, such reduction could adversely impact our SBA lending program.\nA lack of liquidity could adversely affect our operations and jeopardize our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. We rely on our ability to generate deposits and effectively manage the repayment and maturity schedules of our loans and investment securities, respectively, to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to fund our operations. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of our investment securities, the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our most important source of funds is deposits. Deposit balances can decrease when customers perceive alternative investments as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. Furthermore, the portion of our deposit portfolio that is comprised of large uninsured deposits may be more likely to be withdrawn rapidly under adverse economic\nconditions. If customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investments such as money market funds, we would lose a relatively low-cost source of funds, increasing our funding costs and reducing our net interest income and net income.\nOther primary sources of funds consist of cash flows from operations, maturities and sales of investment securities and proceeds from the issuance and sale of our equity and debt securities to investors. Additional liquidity is provided by our ability to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and the Federal Home Loan Bank (the \u201cFHLB\u201d) and our ability to raise brokered deposits. The Company also may borrow funds from third-party lenders, such as other financial institutions. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our activities, or on terms that are acceptable to us, could be impaired by factors that affect us directly or the financial services industry or economy in general, such as disruptions in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry. Our access to funding sources could also be affected by a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the economy of the Houston region or by one or more adverse regulatory actions against us.\nBased on our experience, we believe that our deposit accounts are relatively stable sources of funds. If we increase interest rates paid to retain deposits, our earnings may be adversely affected, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny decline in available funding could adversely impact our ability to originate loans, invest in securities, meet our expenses or fulfill obligations such as repaying our borrowings, funding unfunded commitments or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future, and such capital may not be available when needed or at all.\nWe may need to raise additional capital, in the form of additional debt or equity, in the future to have sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and fund our business needs and future growth, particularly if the quality of our assets or earnings were to deteriorate significantly. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on, among other things, conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of our control, and our financial condition. Economic conditions and a loss of confidence in financial institutions may increase our cost of funding and limit access to certain customary sources of capital or make such capital only available on unfavorable terms, including interbank borrowings, repurchase agreements and borrowings from the discount window of the Federal Reserve. We may not be able to obtain capital on acceptable terms or at all. Any occurrence that may limit our access to the capital markets, such as a decline in the confidence of debt purchasers, depositors of our bank or counterparties participating in the capital markets or other disruption in capital markets, may adversely affect our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and, in turn, our liquidity. Further, if we need to raise capital in the future, we may have to do so when many other financial institutions are also seeking to raise capital and would then have to compete with those institutions for investors. An inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFluctuations in interest rates may adversely impact our earnings and capital levels and overall results of operations.\nLike most financial institutions, our earnings and cash flows depend to a great extent upon the level of our net interest income, or the difference between the interest income we earn on loans, investments and other interest-earning assets, and the interest expense we pay on deposits, borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. Therefore, any change in general market interest rates, such as a change in the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve or otherwise, can have a significant effect on our net interest income. The majority of our banking assets are monetary in nature and subject to risk from changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates can increase or decrease our net interest income, because different types of assets and liabilities may react differently, and at different times, to market interest rate changes. When interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly, or to a greater degree than interest-earning assets in a period, an increase in interest rates could reduce net interest income. Similarly, when interest-earning assets mature or reprice more quickly, or to a greater degree than interest-bearing liabilities, falling interest rates could reduce net interest income.\nAdditionally, an increase in interest rates may, among other things, adversely affect the demand for loans and our ability to originate loans and decrease loan repayment rates. Conversely, a decrease in the general level of interest rates may affect the Company through, among other things, increased prepayments on loan and mortgage-backed securities portfolio and increased competition for deposits. Accordingly, changes in the general level of market interest rates may adversely affect our net yield on interest-earning assets, loan origination volume, loan portfolio and our overall results.\nIn March 2020, the Federal Reserve lowered the target range for the federal funds rate to a range from 0 to 0.25 percent, citing concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on markets and stress in the energy sector. Throughout 2021, the Federal Reserve reaffirmed this target range. While rate increases are expected in 2022, a prolonged period of extremely volatile and unstable market conditions would likely increase our funding costs and negatively affect market risk mitigation strategies. Higher income volatility from changes in interest rates and spreads to benchmark indices could cause a loss of future net interest income and a decrease in current fair market values of our assets. Fluctuations in interest rates will impact both the level of income and expense recorded on most of our assets and liabilities and the market value of all interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our net income, operating results and financial condition.\nAlthough our asset-liability management strategy is designed to control and mitigate exposure to the risks related to changes in market interest rates, those rates are affected by many factors outside of our control, including various governmental and regulatory monetary policies, inflation, recession, changes in unemployment, the money supply, international disorder and instability in domestic and foreign financial markets. Adverse changes in the Federal Reserve interest rate policies or other changes in monetary policies and economic conditions could materially and adversely affect the Company. We may not be able to accurately predict the likelihood, nature and magnitude of those changes or how and to what extent they may affect our business. The Company also may not be able to adequately prepare for or compensate for the consequences of such changes. Any failure to predict and prepare for changes in interest rates or adjust for the consequences of these changes may adversely affect our earnings, capital levels and overall results.\nInterest rates on our outstanding financial instruments might be subject to change based on developments related to LIBOR, which could adversely affect our revenue, expenses and the value of those financial instruments.\nIn 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (the \u201cFCA\u201d), which regulates LIBOR, publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of U.S. financial market participants, selected and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York started in May 2018 to publish the Secured Overnight Finance Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as an alternative to LIBOR. In November 2020, the FCA announced that most tenors of US Dollar LIBOR would continue to be published through June 30, 2023. It is expected that a transition away from the widespread use of LIBOR to alternative rates will continue to occur over the course of the next year. Uncertainty as to the adoption, market acceptance or availability of SOFR or other alternative reference rates may adversely affect the value of LIBOR-based loans and securities in the Company\u2019s portfolio and may impact the availability and cost of hedging instruments and borrowings. The language in the Company\u2019s LIBOR-based contracts and financial instruments has developed over time and may have various events that trigger when a successor index to LIBOR would be selected. If a trigger is satisfied, contracts and financial instruments may give the Company or the calculation agent, as applicable, discretion over the selection of the substitute index for the calculation of interest rates. The implementation of a substitute index for the calculation of interest rates under the Company\u2019s agreements may result in the Company incurring significant expenses in effecting the transition and may result in disputes or litigation with customers over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the substitute index, any of which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nWe could recognize losses on securities held in our securities portfolio, particularly if interest rates increase or economic and market conditions deteriorate.\nThe Company invests in available for sale securities with the primary objectives of providing a source of liquidity, providing an appropriate return on funds invested, managing interest rate risk, meeting pledging requirements and meeting regulatory capital requirements. As of December 31, 2021, the amortized cost of our securities portfolio was $1.75 billion, which represented 24.6% of total assets. Factors beyond our control, including rate hikes, can significantly influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio and can cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of these securities. For example, fixed-rate securities are generally subject to decreases in market value when interest rates rise. Additional factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency downgrades of the securities, defaults by the issuer or individual borrowers with respect to the underlying securities and continued instability in the credit markets. Any of the foregoing factors could cause other-than-temporary impairment in future periods and result in realized losses. The process for determining whether impairment is other-than-temporary usually requires difficult, subjective judgments about the future financial performance of the issuer and any collateral underlying the security in order to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security. Because of volatile economic and market conditions affecting interest rates, the financial condition of issuers of the securities and the performance of the underlying collateral, we may recognize realized and/or unrealized losses in future periods, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the goodwill that we have recorded in connection with a business acquisition becomes impaired, it could require charges to earnings, which would have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nGoodwill represents the amount by which the cost of an acquisition exceeded the fair value of net assets we acquired in connection with the purchase of another financial institution. The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if a triggering event occurs which indicates that the carrying value of the asset might be impaired.\nThe Company determines impairment by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Any such adjustments are reflected in our results of operations in the periods in which they become known. Factors that could cause an impairment charge include adverse changes to macroeconomic conditions, declines in the profitability of the reporting unit or declines in the tangible book value of the reporting unit. While we have not recorded any impairment charges since we initially recorded the goodwill, our future evaluations of goodwill may result in findings of impairment and related write-downs, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. As of December 31, 2021, our goodwill totaled $223.6 million.\nWe face strong competition to attract and retain customers from other companies that offer banking services, which could impact our business by preventing us from obtaining customers and adversely affecting our future growth and profitability.\nWe conduct our operations almost exclusively in the Houston region. Many of our competitors offer the same, or a wider variety of, banking services within this market area. These competitors include banks with nationwide operations, regional banks and other community banks. The Company also faces competition from many other types of financial institutions, including savings banks, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, brokerage and investment banking firms, asset-based non-bank lenders, financial technology (\"fintech\") competitors and certain other non-financial entities, such as retail stores that may maintain their own credit programs and certain governmental organizations that may offer more favorable financing or deposit terms than the Company can. In addition, a number of out-of-state financial intermediaries have opened production offices, or otherwise solicit deposits, in our market area. The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. In particular, the activity of fintech companies has grown significantly over recent years and is expected to continue to grow. Some fintech companies are not subject to the same regulations as we are, which may allow them to be more competitive. Increased competition from fintech companies and the growth of digital banking may also lead to pricing pressures as competitors offer more low-fee and no-fee products. In addition, as customer preferences and expectations continue to evolve, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for banks to expand their geographic reach by providing services over the internet and for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. Increased competition in our market may result in reduced loans and deposits, as well as reduced net interest margin, fee income and profitability. Ultimately, the Company may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. If we are unable to attract and retain banking customers, we may be unable to continue to grow our loan and deposit portfolios, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including, among other things:\n\u2022the ability to develop, maintain and build long-term customer relationships based on top quality service, high ethical standards and safe, sound assets;\n\u2022the scope, relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands;\n\u2022the rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to our competitors;\n\u2022customer satisfaction with our level of service;\n\u2022the ability to expand our market position; and\n\u2022industry and general economic trends.\nFailure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability, which, in turn, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCatastrophic events other than the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect the general economy, financial and capital markets, specific industries and us.\nActs of terrorism, cyber-terrorism, political unrest, war, civil disturbance, armed regional and international hostilities and international responses to these hostilities, natural disasters (including tornadoes, hurricanes, tropical storms, fires, droughts and floods), global health risks or pandemics or the threat of or perceived potential for these events could have a negative impact on us.\nOur business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be successful upon the occurrence of one of these scenarios, and a significant catastrophic event could materially adversely affect our operating results.\nOur business is generated primarily from the Houston region, which is susceptible to damage by hurricanes, tropical storms, tornadoes, floods, droughts and other natural disasters and adverse weather. These catastrophic events can disrupt our operations, cause widespread damage to our property, our customers' property and property held as collateral and severely depress the local economy in which we operate. These catastrophic events may have an impact on our customers and in turn, on us.\nIn addition, these events have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the U.S. and world economy in general and consumer confidence and spending in particular, which could harm our operations. Any of these events could increase volatility in the U.S. and world financial markets, which could harm our stock price and may limit the capital resources available to us and our customers. This could have a material adverse impact on our operating results, revenues and costs and may result in increased volatility in the market price of our common stock.\nClimate change, and related legislative and regulatory initiatives, have the potential to disrupt our business and adversely impact the operations and creditworthiness of our customers.\nClimate change may lead to more frequent and more extreme weather events, such as prolonged droughts or flooding, tornados, hurricanes, wildfires and extreme seasonal weather, which could disrupt operations at one or more of our locations and our ability to provide financial products and services to our customers. Such events could also have a negative effect on the financial status and creditworthiness of our customers, which may decrease revenues and business activities from those customers and increase the credit risk associated with loans and other credit exposures to such customers. In addition, weather disasters, shifts in local climates and other disruptions related to climate change may adversely affect the value of real properties securing our loans, which could diminish the value of our loan portfolio. Such events may also cause reductions in regional and local economic activity that may have an adverse effect on our customers, which could limit our ability to raise and invest capital in these areas and communities, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe current and anticipated effects of climate change are creating an increasing level of concern for the state of the global environment. As a result, political and social attention to the issue of climate change has increased. The federal and state legislatures and regulatory agencies have proposed and are likely to continue to propose and advance numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives seeking to mitigate the effects of climate change. These agreements and measures may result in the imposition of taxes and fees, the required purchase of emission credits, and the implementation of significant operational changes. In addition, the federal banking agencies may address climate-related issues in their agendas in various ways, including by increasing supervisory expectations with respect to banks\u2019 risk management practices, accounting for the effects of climate change in stress testing scenarios and systemic risk assessments, revising expectations for credit portfolio concentrations based on climate-related factors, and encouraging investment by banks in climate-related initiatives and lending to communities disproportionately impacted by the effects of climate change. Each of these initiatives, as well as other similar initiatives, may require us to expend significant capital and incur compliance, operating, maintenance and remediation costs.\nWe are subject to certain operational risks, including fraudulent activities and data processing system failures and errors.\nWe are exposed to many types of operational risk, including the risk of fraudulent activities by employees and outsiders, clerical recordkeeping errors and transactional errors. Our business is dependent on our employees as well as third-party service providers to process a large number of increasingly complex transactions. We could be materially adversely affected if one of our employees or one of our third-party service providers causes a significant operational breakdown or failure, either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates our operations or systems. Employee or third-party service provider errors and employee or customer misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation. Misconduct by an employee or third-party service provider could include hiding unauthorized activities from the Company, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of our customers or improper use of confidential information. It is not always possible to prevent employee or third-party service provider errors and misconduct, and the precautions the Company takes to prevent\nand detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Employee or third-party service provider errors could also subject the Company to financial claims for negligence.\nThe Company maintains a system of internal controls to mitigate against operational risks, including data processing system failures and errors and customer or employee fraud, as well as insurance coverage designed to protect the Company from material losses associated with these risks including losses resulting from any associated business interruption. However, if our internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence, or if any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, when we originate loans, we rely upon information supplied by loan applicants and third parties, including the information contained in the loan application, property appraisal and title information, if applicable, and employment and income documentation provided by third parties. If any of this information is misrepresented and such misrepresentation is not detected prior to loan funding, the Company generally bears the risk of loss associated with the misrepresentation. Any of these occurrences could result in a diminished ability to operate our business, potential liability to customers, reputational damage and regulatory intervention, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a continuing need for technological change, and we may not have the resources to effectively implement new technology, or we may experience operational challenges when implementing new technology.\nThe financial services industry is changing rapidly, and to remain competitive, we must continue to enhance and improve the functionality and features of our products, services and technologies. In addition to better serving our customers, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. Our future success will depend, at least in part, upon our ability to respond to future technological changes and the ability to address the needs of our customers. We address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations as we continue to grow and expand our products and service offerings. We may experience operational challenges as we implement these new technology enhancements or products, which could result in our not fully realizing the anticipated benefits from such new technology or require us to incur significant costs to remedy any such challenges in a timely manner. In addition, complications during a conversion of our core technology platform or implementation or upgrade of any software could negatively impact the experiences or satisfaction of our customers, which could cause those customers to terminate their relationship with us or reduce the amount of business that they do with us, either of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nMany of our larger competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. Third parties upon which we rely for our technology needs may not be able to develop on a cost-effective basis systems that will enable us to keep pace with such developments. As a result, our competitors may be able to offer additional or superior products compared to those that we will be able to provide, which would put us at a competitive disadvantage. We may lose customers seeking new technology-driven products and services to the extent we are unable to provide such products and services. The ability to keep pace with technological change is important, and the failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations could be interrupted if our third-party service providers experience difficulty or terminate their services.\nOur operations depend on a number of relationships with third-party service providers who provide services related to, among other things, core systems processing, essential web hosting and other Internet systems, our online banking services, deposit processing and other processing services. Additionally, we are continuing to increase our usage of and reliance on cloud-based third-party service providers. While we have selected these third-party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. Any complications caused by these third parties, including those resulting from disruptions in communication or internet services provided by a vendor causing us to lose internet access, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, the mishandling of non-public personal information, cyber-attacks and security breaches at a vendor, failure of a vendor to provide services for any reason or poor performance of services, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise conduct our business. If these third-party service providers experience difficulties, including difficulties with the service providers relied on by these third-party service providers, or terminate their services, and we are unable to replace them with other service providers, particularly on a timely basis, our operations could be interrupted. If an interruption were to continue for a significant period of time, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, perhaps materially. Even if we were able to replace third-party service providers, it may be at a higher cost, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a result of the measures implemented to respond to the pandemic and general staffing shortages, many third parties on which we rely in our business operations, including the appraiser(s) of the real property collateral, vendors that supply essential services such as loan servicers, providers of financial information, systems and analytical tools and providers of electronic payment and settlement systems, and local and federal government agencies, offices and courthouses, may be limited in the availability and access to their services. If the third-party service providers continue to have limited capacities or experience staffing shortages for a prolonged period or if additional limitations or potential disruptions in these services materialize, it may negatively affect our operations.\nWe could be adversely impacted by fraudulent activity, breaches of our information security and cybersecurity attacks.\nAs a financial institution, we are susceptible to fraudulent activity, information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents that may be committed against us, our clients or third-parties with whom we interact and that may result in financial losses or increased costs to us or our clients, disclosure or misuse of confidential information belonging to us or personal or confidential information belonging to our clients, misappropriation of assets and litigation. The occurrence of any of these could also damage our reputation. Our industry has seen increases in electronic fraudulent activity, hacking, security breaches, sophisticated social engineering and cyber-attacks, including within the commercial banking sector, as cyber-criminals have been targeting commercial bank accounts on an increasing basis.\nOur business is highly dependent on the security and efficacy of our infrastructure, computer and data management systems, as well as those of third-parties with whom we interact or on whom we rely. Our business relies on the secure processing, transmission, storage and retrieval of confidential, proprietary and other information in our computer and data management systems and networks and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third-parties. In addition, to access our network, products and services, our customers and other third-parties may use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of our network environment and are subject to their own cybersecurity risks. All of these factors increase our risks related to cyber-threats and electronic disruptions.\nIn addition to well-known risks related to fraudulent activity, which take many forms, such as check \u201ckiting\u201d or fraud, wire fraud and other dishonest acts, information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents have become a material risk in the financial services industry. These threats may include fraudulent or unauthorized access to data processing or data storage systems used by us or by our clients, electronic identity theft, \u201cphishing\u201d, account takeover, ransomware, denial or degradation of service attacks and malware or other cyber-attacks.\nIn recent periods, several governmental agencies and large corporations, including financial service organizations and retail companies, have suffered major data breaches, in some cases exposing not only their confidential and proprietary corporate information, but also sensitive financial and other personal information of their employees, clients or other third-parties, and subjecting those agencies and corporations to potential fraudulent activity and their employees, clients and other third-parties to identity theft and fraudulent activity in their debit card and banking accounts. Therefore, security breaches and cyber-attacks can cause significant increases in operating costs, including the costs of compensating clients and customers for any resulting losses they may incur, and the costs and capital expenditures required to correct the deficiencies in and strengthen the security of data processing and storage systems.\nWhile we invest in systems and processes that are designed to detect and prevent security breaches and cyber-attacks and we conduct periodic tests of our security systems and processes, we may not succeed in anticipating or adequately protecting against or preventing all security breaches and cyber-attacks from occurring. Even the most advanced internal control environment may be vulnerable to compromise. Targeted social engineering attacks are becoming more sophisticated and are extremely difficult to prevent. Additionally, the existence of cyber-attacks or security breaches at third-parties with access to our data, such as vendors, may not be disclosed to us in a timely manner. As cyber-threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents.\nAs is the case with non-electronic fraudulent activity, cyber-attacks or other information or security breaches, whether directed at us or third-parties, may result in a material loss or have material consequences. Furthermore, the public perception that a cyber-attack on our systems has been successful, whether or not this perception is correct, may damage our reputation with customers and third-parties with whom we do business. A successful penetration or circumvention of system security could cause negative consequences, including loss of customers and business opportunities, disruption to our operations and business, misappropriation or destruction of our confidential information and/or that of our customers, or damage to our customers\u2019 and/or third-parties\u2019 computers or systems, and could expose us to additional regulatory scrutiny and result in a violation of applicable privacy laws and other laws, litigation exposure, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, loss of confidence in our security measures, reputational damage,\nreimbursement or other compensatory costs, additional compliance costs and could adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nWe are subject to laws regarding the privacy, information security and protection of personal information and any violation of these laws or another incident involving personal, confidential or proprietary information of individuals could damage our reputation and otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nOur business requires the collection and retention of large volumes of customer data, including personally identifiable information in various information systems that we maintain and in those maintained by third parties with whom we contract to provide data services. We also maintain important internal company data such as personally identifiable information about our employees and information relating to our operations. We are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations governing the privacy and protection of personal information of individuals (including customers, employees, suppliers and other third parties). Various state and federal banking regulators and states have also enacted data security breach notification requirements with varying levels of individual, consumer, regulatory or law enforcement notification in certain circumstances in the event of a security breach. Ensuring that our collection, use, transfer and storage of personal information complies with all applicable laws and regulations can increase our costs.\nFurthermore, we may not be able to ensure that all of our clients, suppliers, counterparties and other third parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information that they exchange with us, particularly where such information is transmitted by electronic means. If personal, confidential or proprietary information of customers or others were to be mishandled or misused (in situations where, for example, such information was erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, or where such information was intercepted or otherwise compromised by third parties), we could be exposed to litigation or regulatory sanctions under personal information laws and regulations. Concerns regarding the effectiveness of our measures to safeguard personal information, or even the perception that such measures are inadequate, could cause us to lose customers or potential customers for our products and services and thereby reduce our revenues. Accordingly, any failure or perceived failure to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws and regulations may subject us to inquiries, examinations and investigations that could result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices or in significant liabilities, fines or penalties, and could damage our reputation and otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to environmental liabilities in connection with the real properties we own and the foreclosure on real estate assets securing our loan portfolio.\nIn the course of our business, we may acquire real estate in connection with our growth efforts, or we may foreclose on and take title to real estate or otherwise be deemed to be in control of property that serves as collateral on loans we make. As a result, we could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to those properties. We may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination, or we may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property.\nThe cost of removal or abatement may substantially exceed the value of the affected properties or the loans secured by those properties; we may not have adequate remedies against the prior owners or other responsible parties; and we may not be able to resell the affected properties either before or after completion of any such removal or abatement procedures. Furthermore, the value of the property as collateral will generally be substantially reduced, or we may elect not to foreclose on the property and, as a result, we may suffer a loss upon collection of the loan. Any significant environmental liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Industry and Regulation\nOur business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects could be adversely affected by the highly regulated environment for bank holding companies and the laws and regulations that govern our operations, corporate governance, executive compensation and accounting principles or changes in any of them.\nAs a bank holding company, we are subject to extensive examination, supervision and comprehensive regulation by various federal and state agencies that govern almost all aspects of our operations. These laws and regulations are not intended to protect our shareholders. Rather, these laws and regulations are intended to protect customers, depositors, the FDIC's DIF and the overall financial\nstability of the U.S. These laws and regulations, among other matters, prescribe minimum capital requirements, impose limitations on the business activities in which the Company can engage, limit the dividend or distributions that the Bank can pay to the Company, restrict the ability of institutions to guarantee our debt and impose certain specific accounting requirements on the Company that may be more restrictive and may result in greater or earlier charges to earnings or reductions in our capital than GAAP would require. Compliance with these laws and regulations is difficult and costly, and changes to these laws and regulations often impose additional compliance costs. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations, even if the failure follows good faith efforts to comply or reflects a difference in interpretation, could subject the Company to restrictions on our business activities, fines and other penalties, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations, capital base and the price of our securities. Further, any new laws, rules or regulations could make compliance more difficult or expensive.\nState and federal banking agencies periodically conduct examinations of our business, including compliance with laws and regulations, and our failure to comply with any supervisory actions to which it is or becomes subject as a result of such examinations may adversely affect the Company.\nTexas and federal banking agencies, including the TDB and the Federal Reserve, periodically conduct examinations of our business, including compliance with laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, a Texas or federal banking agency were to determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity or other aspects of any of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or that Allegiance, the Bank or their respective management were in violation of any law or regulation, it may take a number of different remedial actions as it deems appropriate. These actions include the power to enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices, to require affirmative actions to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our and/or the Bank\u2019s capital, to restrict our growth, to assess civil monetary penalties against Allegiance, the Bank or their respective officers or directors, to remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate the Bank\u2019s deposit insurance. If we become subject to such regulatory actions, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and reputation may be negatively impacted.\nWe may be unable to identify and consummate our new activities and expansion plans and successfully implement our growth strategy, which will require regulatory approvals, and failure to obtain them may restrict our growth.\nWe intend to continue to grow our business through strategic acquisitions of financial institutions coupled with organic growth. Generally, we must receive state and federal regulatory approval before we can acquire an FDIC-insured depository institution or related business. In determining whether to approve a proposed acquisition, federal banking regulators will consider, among other factors, the effect of the acquisition on competition, our financial condition, liquidity, our future prospects and the impact of the proposal on U.S. financial stability. The regulators also review current and projected capital ratios and levels, the competence, experience and integrity of management and our record of compliance with laws and regulations, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served (including the acquiring institution\u2019s record of compliance under the CRA) and the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities. Such regulatory approvals may not be granted on terms that are acceptable to the Company, or at all, or may be granted only after lengthy delay. We may also be required to sell or, in the alternative, commit to retain branches as a condition to receiving regulatory approval, which may not be acceptable to us or, if acceptable to us, may reduce the benefit of any acquisition.\nIn addition to the acquisition of existing financial institutions, as opportunities arise, we plan to continue de novo branching as a part of our organic growth strategy. De novo branching and any acquisitions carry with them numerous risks, including the inability to obtain all required regulatory approvals. The failure to obtain these regulatory approvals for potential future strategic acquisitions and de novo branches may impact our business plans and restrict our growth.\nWe face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nThe federal Bank Secrecy Act, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, established by the U.S. Department of the Treasury (\u201cU.S. Treasury\u201d) to administer the Bank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements, and engages in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice (the \u201cDepartment of Justice\u201d), Drug Enforcement Administration and Internal Revenue Service.\nWe provide banking services to customers located outside the United States, primarily in Guatemala. These banking services are primarily deposit accounts, including checking, money market and short term certificates of deposit. As of December 31, 2021, our deposits from foreign nationals, primarily residents of Guatemala, accounted for approximately 2% of our total deposits.\nIn order to comply with regulations, guidelines and examination procedures in this area, we have dedicated significant resources to our anti-money laundering program. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, we could be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plans, including acquisitions and de novo branching. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us.\nFailure to comply with economic and trade sanctions or with applicable anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOFAC administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions against targeted foreign countries and regimes, under authority of various laws, including designated foreign countries, nationals and others. We are responsible for, among other things, blocking accounts of and transactions with such persons and countries, prohibiting unlicensed trade and financial transactions with them and reporting blocked transactions after their occurrence. In addition, we are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, which prohibits offering, promising, giving, or authorizing others to give anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to a non-U.S. government official in order to influence official action or otherwise gain an unfair business advantage. We are also subject to applicable anti-corruption laws in the jurisdictions in which we may operate. Failure to comply with economic and trade sanctions or with applicable anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for us.\nWe are subject to numerous federal and state lending laws designed to protect consumers, including the Community Reinvestment Act and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to material sanctions and penalties.\nThe CRA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Department of Justice and other federal and state agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. A successful challenge to an institution\u2019s performance under the CRA or fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity and restrictions on expansion activity. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation.\nWe may be required to pay significantly higher FDIC deposit insurance assessments in the future, which could adversely affect our earnings.\nOn September 15, 2020, in response to the decline in the reserve ratio due to extraordinary deposit growth resulting mainly from the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDIC adopted a restoration plan to restore the DIF reserve ratio to at least 1.35% within eight years, as required by the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. At least semi-annually, the FDIC updates its loss and income projections for the fund and, if needed, increases or decreases assessment rates. If any required increase is insufficient for the DIF to meet its funding requirements, further special assessments or increases in deposit insurance premiums may be required. We are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance. If there are additional financial institution failures that affect the DIF, we may be required to pay FDIC premiums higher than current levels. Our regulatory assessments and FDIC insurance costs were $3.4 million and $2.9 million for both of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Future additional assessments, increases or required prepayments in FDIC insurance premiums may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Federal Reserve may require Allegiance to commit capital resources to support the Bank.\nA bank holding company is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and to commit resources to support its subsidiary banks. The Federal Reserve may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank. Under these requirements, in the future, Allegiance could be required to provide financial assistance to the Bank if it experiences financial distress.\nA capital injection may be required at times when our resources are limited and we may be required to borrow the funds to make the required capital injection. In the event of a bank holding company\u2019s bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank. Moreover, bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of the holding company\u2019s general unsecured creditors, including the holders of any note obligations. Thus, any borrowing that must be done by the holding company in order to make the required capital injection becomes more difficult and expensive and will adversely impact the holding company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be materially and adversely affected by the soundness, creditworthiness and liquidity of other financial institutions.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks and other institutional customers. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or customer. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to us. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMonetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to being affected by general economic conditions, our earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the U.S. money supply and credit conditions. Among the instruments used by the Federal Reserve to implement these objectives are open market operations in U.S. government securities, adjustments of both the discount rate and the federal funds rate and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits. The monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. Although we cannot determine the effects of such policies on us at this time, such policies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Allegiance's Common Stock\nThe market price of Allegiance's common stock could be volatile and may fluctuate significantly, which could cause the value of an investment in Allegiance's common stock to decline.\nThe market price of Allegiance's common stock could fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022general economic conditions and overall market fluctuations;\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly or annual financial results;\n\u2022operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to ours;\n\u2022the perception that investment in Texas is unattractive or less attractive during periods of low oil prices;\n\u2022announcements by the Company or our competitors of significant acquisitions, dispositions, innovations or new programs and services;\n\u2022the public reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC;\n\u2022changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts following Allegiance's stock, or the failure of securities analysts to cover Allegiance's common stock;\n\u2022changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;\n\u2022the trading volume of Allegiance's common stock;\n\u2022changes in dividends and capital returns;\n\u2022changes in governmental monetary policies, including the policies of the Federal Reserve;\n\u2022changes in business, legal or regulatory conditions, or other developments affecting participants in our industry, and publicity regarding our business or any of our significant customers or competitors;\n\u2022changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles; and\n\u2022future sales of Allegiance's common stock by the Company, directors, executives and significant shareholders.\nThe realization of any of the risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section could have a material adverse effect on the market price of Allegiance's common stock and cause the value of an investment in Allegiance's common stock to decline. In addition, the stock market has experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These types of broad market fluctuations may adversely affect investor confidence and could affect the trading price of Allegiance's common stock over the short, medium or long term, regardless of our actual performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, shareholders have often instituted securities class action litigation. If we were to be involved in a class action lawsuit, we could incur substantial costs and it could divert the attention of senior management and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAllegiance may issue shares of preferred stock in the future, which could make it difficult for another company to acquire it or could otherwise adversely affect the rights of the holders of Allegiance's common stock, which could depress the price of our common stock.\nAllegiance's amended and restated certificate of formation authorizes it to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of one or more series of preferred stock. Allegiance's Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, has the authority to determine the preferences, limitations and relative rights of shares of preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series, the designation of such series and the dividend rate for each series, without any further vote or action by Allegiance's shareholders. Allegiance's preferred stock may be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to the rights of Allegiance's common stock. The potential issuance of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control of the Company, discouraging bids for Allegiance's common stock at a premium over the market price, and materially adversely affect the market price and the voting and other rights of the holders of Allegiance's common stock.\nAllegiance\u2019s ability to declare and pay dividends is limited.\nOur Board of Directors has approved the payment of quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. However, there can be no assurance of whether or when we may pay dividends on our common stock in the future. Our ability to pay dividends is dependent on the Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends to it, which is limited by applicable laws and banking regulations. Payments of future dividends, if any, will be declared and paid at the discretion of our Board of Directors after taking into account our business, operating results and financial condition, current and anticipated cash needs, plan for expansion and any legal or contractual limitations on our ability to pay dividends. In addition, Allegiance's existing credit agreement restricts our ability to pay dividends.\nAllegiance is dependent upon the Bank for cash flow, and the Bank\u2019s ability to make cash distributions is restricted, which could impact Allegiance's ability to satisfy its obligations.\nAllegiance's primary tangible asset is the Bank. As such, Allegiance depends upon the Bank for cash distributions (through dividends on the Bank\u2019s stock) that Allegiance uses to pay its operating expenses and satisfy its obligations, including debt obligations. There are numerous laws and banking regulations that limit the Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends to Allegiance. If the Bank is unable to pay dividends to Allegiance, it will not be able to satisfy its obligations. These statutes and regulations require, among other things, that the Bank maintain certain levels of capital in order to pay a dividend. Further, federal and state banking authorities have the ability to restrict the Bank\u2019s payment of dividends through supervisory action.\nAllegiance's corporate governance documents and certain corporate and banking provisions of Texas law applicable to it could have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, make more difficult or prevent an attempted acquisition and other actions.\nAllegiance's amended and restated certificate of formation and bylaws contain certain provisions that may have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, discourage or prevent an attempted acquisition or change of control. These provisions include:\n\u2022staggered terms for directors, who may be removed from office only for cause;\n\u2022a provision establishing certain advance notice procedures for nomination of candidates for election as directors and for shareholder proposals; and\n\u2022a provision that any special meeting of Allegiance's shareholders may be called only by a majority of the Board of Directors, the President or a holder or group of holders of at least 50% of Allegiance shares entitled to vote at the meeting.\nAllegiance's amended and restated certificate of formation does not provide for cumulative voting for directors and authorizes the Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock without shareholder approval and upon such terms as the Board of Directors may determine. The issuance of Allegiance's preferred stock, while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions, financings and other corporate purposes, could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third-party from acquiring, a controlling interest. In addition, certain provisions of Texas law, including a provision that restricts certain business combinations between a Texas corporation and certain affiliated shareholders, may delay, discourage or prevent an attempted acquisition or change in control.\nIn addition, banking laws impose notice, approval and ongoing regulatory requirements on any shareholder or other party that seeks to acquire direct or indirect \u201ccontrol\u201d of an FDIC-insured depository institution. These laws include the BHC Act and the Change in Bank Control Act. These laws could delay or prevent an acquisition.\nFurthermore, Allegiance's amended and restated certificate of formation provides that the state and federal courts located in Harris County, Texas, the county in which the City of Houston lies, will be the exclusive forum for: (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on Allegiance's behalf; (b) any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; (c) any action asserting a claim against Allegiance arising pursuant to the Texas Business Organizations Code, Allegiance's certificate of formation, or Allegiance's bylaws; or (d) any action asserting a claim against Allegiance that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Shareholders of Allegiance are deemed to have notice of and have consented to the provisions of Allegiance's amended and restated certificate of formation related to choice of forum. The choice of forum provision in Allegiance's amended and restated certificate of formation may limit our shareholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with Allegiance. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in Allegiance's amended and restated certificate of formation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, Allegiance may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm Allegiance's business, operating results and financial condition.\nShareholders may be deemed to be acting in concert or otherwise in control of Allegiance, which could impose notice, approval and ongoing regulatory requirements and result in adverse regulatory consequences for such holders.\nAllegiance is a bank holding company regulated by the Federal Reserve. Banking laws impose notice, approval and ongoing regulatory requirements on any shareholder or other party that seeks to acquire direct or indirect \u201ccontrol\u201d of an FDIC-insured depository institution or a company that controls an FDIC-insured depository institution, such as a bank holding company. These laws include the BHC Act and the Change in Bank Control Act. The determination whether an investor \u201ccontrols\u201d a depository institution or holding company is based on all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the investment. As a general matter, a party is deemed to control a depository institution or other company if the party (1) owns or controls 25% or more of any class of voting stock of the bank or other company, (2) controls the election of a majority of the directors of the bank or other company or (3) has the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of the bank or other company. In addition, subject to rebuttal, a party may be presumed to control a depository institution or other company if the investor owns or controls 10% or more of any class of voting stock. Subject to rebuttal, a person may be presumed to control a depository institution or other company if the person owns or controls 10% or more of any class of voting stock and other regulatory criteria are met. Ownership by affiliated persons, or persons acting in concert, is typically aggregated for these purposes.\nIn January 2020, the Federal Reserve approved a final rule that clarifies the framework for when a company controls a bank holding company or bank under the BHC Act. In particular, the final rule sets forth tiered presumptions of control in the Federal Reserve\u2019s regulations. Under the BHC Act, a company controls a bank holding company if it controls 25 percent or more of any class of voting securities of the bank holding company. A company that controls less than 5 percent of any class of voting securities of a bank holding company is presumed not to control the bank holding company. In instances in which a company owns at least 5 percent but less than 25 percent, the Federal Reserve considers the full fact and circumstances of the relationship between the company and the bank holding company to determine whether the company controls the bank holding company. As part of its determination as to control, the Federal Reserve considers, among other things, level of ownership of voting and non-voting securities, board representation, business relationships, senior management interlocks, contractual limits on major operational or policy decisions, proxies on issues, threats to dispose of securities, and management agreements. The rule also provides several additional examples of presumptions of control and noncontrol, along with various ancillary provisions such as definitions of terms used in the presumptions. The changes in the final rule became effective September 30, 2020.", "PERMNO": 15774, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "ABTX"}
