{"cik": "1429260", "company": "Fortress Biotech, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our Common Stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes, before deciding to invest in shares of our Common Stock. If any of the following risks were to materialize, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our Common Stock could decline and you could lose part of or all of your investment in our Common Stock.\nRisks Related to our Growth Strategy\nWe may not be able to generate returns for our investors if our subsidiaries, which have limited or no operating history and no commercialized revenue generating products, cannot obtain additional third-party financing and commercialize products.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we have made and will likely continue to make substantial investments in our subsidiaries, which at the time of investment, have limited or no operating history, no commercialized revenue generating products, and require additional third-party financing to fund product development. Our business depends in large part on one or more of our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to innovate, in-license, acquire or invest in successful pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and/or companies in increasingly competitive and highly regulated markets. If our subsidiaries do not successfully obtain additional third-party financing and commercialize products, the value of our investments and our business may be materially adversely affected.\nIf our subsidiaries cannot innovate, develop and commercialize pharmaceutical and biotechnology products, we may not be able to generate royalty revenue.\nOur revenue growth strategy also depends on our ability to generate royalty-related fees from our subsidiaries. If our subsidiaries cannot innovate, develop and commercialize pharmaceutical and biotechnology products, we may not be able to generate revenue growth as anticipated.\nIf we cannot continue to fund our and our subsidiaries\u2019 research and development programs, we and our subsidiaries may be required to reduce product development, which will adversely impact our growth strategy.\nOur and our subsidiaries\u2019 research and development (\u201cR&D\u201d) programs will require substantial additional capital to conduct research, preclinical testing and human studies, establish pilot scale and commercial scale manufacturing processes and facilities, and establish and develop quality control, regulatory, marketing, sales and administrative capabilities to support these programs. We expect to fund our and our subsidiaries\u2019 R&D activities from a combination of cash generated from royalties and milestones from our partners in various past and future collaborations and additional equity or debt financings from third parties. These financings could depress our stock price. If additional funds are required to support our or our subsidiaries\u2019 operations and such funds cannot be obtained on favorable terms, we and our subsidiaries may not be able to develop products, which will adversely impact our growth strategy.\nCollaborative relationships with third parties could cause us or our subsidiaries to expend significant resources and incur substantial business risk with no assurance of financial return.\nWe anticipate substantial reliance upon strategic collaborations for marketing and commercializing our and our subsidiaries\u2019 existing product candidates, and we and our subsidiaries may rely even more on strategic collaborations for R&D of other product candidates. We and our subsidiaries may sell product offerings through strategic partnerships with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. If we or our subsidiaries are unable to establish or manage such strategic collaborations on terms favorable to us in the future, our revenue and drug development may be limited.\nIf we or our subsidiaries enter into R&D collaborations during the early phases of drug development, success will in part depend on the performance of research collaborators. Neither we nor our subsidiaries will directly control the amount or timing of resources devoted by research collaborators to activities related to product candidates. Research collaborators may not commit sufficient resources to our or our subsidiaries\u2019 R&D programs. If any research collaborator fails to commit sufficient resources, the preclinical or clinical development programs related to the collaboration could be delayed or terminated. Also, collaborators may pursue existing or other development-stage products or alternative technologies in preference to those being developed in collaboration with us or our subsidiaries. Finally, if we or our subsidiaries fail to make required milestone or royalty payments to collaborators or to observe other obligations in agreements with them, the collaborators may have the right to terminate or stop performance of those agreements.\nEstablishing strategic collaborations is difficult and time-consuming. Our and our subsidiaries\u2019 discussions with potential collaborators may not lead to the establishment of collaborations on favorable terms, if at all. Potential collaborators may reject collaborations based upon their assessment of our and our subsidiaries\u2019 financial, regulatory or intellectual property position. Even if we or our subsidiaries successfully establish new collaborations, these relationships may never result in the successful development or commercialization of product candidates or the generation of sales revenue. To the extent that we or our subsidiaries enter into collaborative arrangements, the related product revenues are likely to be lower than if we or our subsidiaries directly marketed and sold products.\nManagement of our relationships with collaborators will require:\n\u00b7 significant time and effort from our management team, as well as from the management teams of our subsidiaries;\n\u00b7 coordination of our and our subsidiaries\u2019 marketing and R&D programs with the respective marketing and R&D priorities of our collaborators; and\n\u00b7 effective allocation of our and our subsidiaries\u2019 resources to multiple projects.\nWe may not be able to manage our anticipated growth, which may in turn adversely impact our business.\nWe will need to continue to expend funds on improving our infrastructure to address our anticipated growth. Acquisitions of products, even through our multiple subsidiaries, could place a strain on management, and administrative, operational and financial systems. In addition, we may need to hire, train and manage more employees, focusing on their integration with our Company and corporate culture. Integration and management issues associated with increased acquisitions may require a disproportionate amount of our management\u2019s time and attention and distract our management from other activities related to running our business.\nAs we continue to execute our growth strategy, we may be subject to further government regulation which would adversely affect our operations.\nIf we engage in business combinations and other transactions that result in our Company holding passive investment interests in a number of entities, we may become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d). If we do become subject to the Investment Company Act, we would be required to register as an investment company and could be expected to incur significant registration and compliance costs in the future.\nWe may not be able to hire or retain key officers or employees for our Company, and in some cases, our subsidiaries, to implement our business strategy and develop products and businesses.\nOur success depends significantly on the continued contributions of our executive officers, scientific and technical personnel and consultants, and on our ability to attract additional personnel for our Company and, in some cases, our subsidiaries as we continue to implement our growth strategy and develop products. During our and our subsidiaries\u2019 operating history, many essential responsibilities have been assigned to a relatively small number of individuals. However, as we continue to implement our growth strategy and our subsidiaries grow, the demands on our key employees will expand and we will need to recruit additional qualified employees for our Company and, possibly, for our subsidiaries. The competition for such qualified personnel is intense, and the loss of services of certain key personnel or our or our subsidiaries\u2019 inability to attract additional personnel to fill critical positions could adversely affect our business.\nWe currently depend heavily upon the efforts and abilities of our management team and the management teams of our subsidiaries. The loss or unavailability of the services of any of these individuals for any significant period of time could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results. In addition, we have not obtained, do not own, nor are we the beneficiary of key-person life insurance for all of our and our subsidiaries\u2019 key personnel. We only maintain a limited amount of directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance coverage to protect all of our directors and executive officers taken together (and those of our subsidiaries until they go public). There can be no assurance that this coverage will be sufficient to cover the costs of the events that may lead to its invocation, in which case, there could be a substantial impact on our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to continue operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe are an early-stage company, with limited operating history upon which stockholders can base an investment decision.\nWe remain an early-stage biopharmaceutical company and our subsidiaries, on whose success we largely rely, are also early-stage biopharmaceutical companies. To date, we and our subsidiaries have engaged primarily in R&D and investment activities and have not generated any revenues from product sales. We and our subsidiaries have incurred significant net losses since our inception. As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $190.2 million. We and our subsidiaries have not demonstrated our ability to perform the functions necessary for the successful commercialization of any of our products. The successful commercialization of our products will require us to perform a variety of functions, including:\n\u00b7 continuing to undertake pre-clinical development and clinical trials;\n\u00b7 participating in regulatory approval processes;\n\u00b7 formulating and manufacturing products; and\n\u00b7 conducting sales and marketing activities.\nOur operations have been limited to organizing and staffing our Company (and in some cases our subsidiaries), acquiring, developing and securing the proprietary rights for, and undertaking pre-clinical development and clinical trials of product candidates, and making investments in other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. These operations provide a limited basis for our stockholders and prospective investors to assess our ability to commercialize product candidates, develop potential product candidates and make successful investments in pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.\nOur existing product candidate and our subsidiaries\u2019 current and future product candidates are at an early stage of development and may not be successfully developed or commercialized.\nOur existing product candidate, CNDO-109, and most of our subsidiaries\u2019 product candidates remain in the early stage of development and will require substantial further capital expenditures, development, testing and regulatory clearances prior to commercialization. The development and regulatory approval process takes several years and it is not likely that CNDO-109 or all our subsidiaries\u2019 product candidates, even if successfully developed and approved by the FDA, would be commercially available for several years. Of the large number of drugs in development, only a small percentage successfully completes the FDA regulatory approval process and is commercialized. Accordingly, even if we and our subsidiaries are able to obtain the requisite financing to fund development programs, we cannot assure you that any of our or our subsidiaries\u2019 product candidates will be successfully developed or commercialized, which could result in the failure of our business and a loss of your investment in our Company.\nBecause we and our subsidiaries in-license certain product candidates from third parties, any dispute with the licensors or the non-performance of such license agreements may adversely affect our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to develop and commercialize the applicable product candidates.\nAll of our existing product candidates and certain of our subsidiaries\u2019 product candidates, including related intellectual property rights, were in-licensed from third parties. Under the terms of the license agreements, the licensors generally have the right to terminate such agreements in the event of a material breach. The licenses require us and our subsidiaries to make annual, milestone or other payments prior to commercialization of any product and our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to make these payments depends on the ability to generate cash in the future. These license agreements also generally require the use of diligent and reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize product candidates.\nIf there is any conflict, dispute, disagreement or issue of non-performance between us or one of our subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the respective licensing partner, on the other hand, regarding the rights or obligations under the license agreements, including any conflict, dispute or disagreement arising from a failure to satisfy payment obligations under such agreements, the ability to develop and commercialize the affected product candidate may be adversely affected.\nProduct candidates we or our subsidiaries advance into clinical trials may not receive regulatory approval.\nPharmaceutical development has inherent risk. We and our subsidiaries will be required to demonstrate through well-controlled clinical trials that product candidates are effective with a favorable benefit-risk profile for use in their target indications before seeking regulatory approvals for their commercial sale. Success in early clinical trials does not mean that later clinical trials will be successful as product candidates in later-stage clinical trials may fail to demonstrate sufficient safety or efficacy despite having progressed through initial clinical testing. Also, we or our subsidiaries may need to conduct additional clinical trials that are not currently anticipated. Companies frequently suffer significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after earlier clinical trials have shown promising results. As a result, product candidates we or our subsidiaries advance into clinical trials may not receive regulatory approval.\nAny product candidates we or our subsidiaries advance into clinical development are subject to extensive regulation, which can be costly and time consuming, cause unanticipated delays or prevent the receipt of the required approvals to commercialize product candidates.\nThe clinical development, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export, marketing and distribution of any product candidate, including our product candidate, CNDO-109, and our subsidiaries\u2019 product candidates, is subject to extensive regulation by the FDA in the United States and by comparable health authorities in foreign markets. In the United States, neither we nor our subsidiaries are permitted to market our product candidates until such product candidate\u2019s Biologics License Application (\u201cBLA\u201d) or New Drug Application is approved by the FDA. The process of obtaining approval is expensive, often takes many years and can vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the products involved. Our development of CNDO-109, which is an individualized immunotherapy, may in particular be affected because to date the FDA has only approved one individualized immunotherapy treatment. Our subsidiaries\u2019 development of individualized immunotherapies, if any, will face similar challenges. In addition to the significant clinical testing requirements, our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to obtain marketing approval for product candidates depends on obtaining the final results of required non-clinical testing, including characterization of the manufactured components of our product candidates and validation of our and our subsidiaries\u2019 manufacturing processes. The FDA may determine that our or our subsidiaries\u2019 product manufacturing processes, testing procedures or facilities are insufficient to justify approval. Approval policies or regulations may change and the FDA has substantial discretion in the pharmaceutical approval process, including the ability to delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons. Despite the time and expense invested in clinical development of product candidates, regulatory approval is never guaranteed.\nThe FDA and other regulatory agencies can delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7 the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials or those of our subsidiaries;\n\u00b7 our or our subsidiaries\u2019 inability to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA that a product candidate is safe and effective for any indication;\n\u00b7 the FDA may not accept clinical data from trials which are conducted by individual investigators or in countries where the standard of care is potentially different from that of the United States;\n\u00b7 the results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA for approval;\n\u00b7 the FDA may disagree with the interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u00b7 the FDA may fail to approve the manufacturing processes or facilities or those of third-party manufacturers with which we, or our subsidiaries or our respective collaborators contract for clinical and commercial supplies; or\n\u00b7 the approval policies or regulations of the FDA may significantly change in a manner rendering the clinical data insufficient for approval.\nWith respect to foreign markets, approval procedures vary among countries and, in addition to the aforementioned risks, can involve additional product testing, administrative review periods and agreements with pricing authorities. In addition, recent events raising questions about the safety of certain marketed pharmaceuticals may result in increased cautiousness by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities in reviewing new pharmaceuticals based on safety, efficacy or other regulatory considerations and may result in significant delays in obtaining regulatory approvals. Any delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, applicable regulatory approvals would prevent us or our subsidiaries from commercializing our product candidates.\nAny product candidate we or our subsidiaries advance into clinical trials may cause unacceptable adverse events or have other properties that may delay or prevent their regulatory approval or commercialization or limit their commercial potential.\nUnacceptable adverse events caused by any of our or our subsidiaries\u2019 product candidates that we advance into clinical trials could cause regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or stop clinical trials and could result in the denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications and markets. This, in turn, could prevent us or our subsidiaries from commercializing the affected product candidate and generating revenues from its sale. For example, in Phase 1/2 oncology trials, dose limiting toxicity (\u201cDLT\u201d) stopping rules are commonly applied. Our CNDO-109 Phase 1/2 trial is subject to a set of DLTs that could suspend or stop dose escalation by predetermined criteria, including allergic reactions, prolonged aplasia or other organ toxicities of a serious nature.\nNeither we nor all of our subsidiaries have completed testing of all our product candidates for the treatment of the indications for which we intend to seek product approval in humans, and we currently do not know the extent of adverse events, if any, that will be observed in patients who receive any of our or our subsidiaries\u2019 product candidates. If any of our or our subsidiaries\u2019 product candidates cause unacceptable adverse events in clinical trials, neither we nor our subsidiaries may be able to obtain regulatory approval or commercialize such products or, if such product candidates are approved for marketing, future adverse events could cause us or our subsidiaries to withdraw such products from the market.\nDelays in the commencement of our clinical trials could result in increased costs and delay our or our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pursue regulatory approval.\nThe commencement of clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including delays in:\n\u00b7 obtaining regulatory clearance to commence a clinical trial;\n\u00b7 identifying, recruiting and training suitable clinical investigators;\n\u00b7 reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective clinical research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d) and trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation, may be subject to modification from time to time and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u00b7 obtaining sufficient quantities of a product candidate for use in clinical trials;\n\u00b7 obtaining Institutional Review Board (\u201cIRB\u201d) or ethics committee approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site;\n\u00b7 identifying, recruiting and enrolling patients to participate in a clinical trial;\n\u00b7 retaining patients who have initiated a clinical trial but may withdraw due to adverse events from the therapy, insufficient efficacy, fatigue with the clinical trial process or personal issues; and\nAny delays in the commencement of our or our subsidiaries\u2019 clinical trials will delay our or our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pursue regulatory approval for product candidates. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate.\nSuspensions or delays in the completion of clinical testing could result in increased costs and delay or prevent our or our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to complete development of that product or generate product revenues.\nOnce a clinical trial has begun, patient recruitment and enrollment may be slower than we anticipate. Clinical trials may also be delayed as a result of ambiguous or negative interim results or difficulties in obtaining sufficient quantities of product manufactured in accordance with regulatory requirements and on a timely basis. Further, a clinical trial may be modified, suspended or terminated by us or our subsidiaries, an IRB, an ethics committee or a data safety monitoring committee overseeing the clinical trial, any clinical trial site with respect to that site, or the FDA or other regulatory authorities due to a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7 failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols;\n\u00b7 inspection of the clinical trial operations or clinical trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold;\n\u00b7 stopping rules contained in the protocol;\n\u00b7 unforeseen safety issues or any determination that the clinical trial presents unacceptable health risks; and\n\u00b7 lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial.\nChanges in regulatory requirements and guidance also may occur and we or our subsidiaries may need to amend clinical trial protocols to reflect these changes. Amendments may require us or our subsidiaries to resubmit clinical trial protocols to IRBs for re-examination, which may in turn impact the costs and timing of, and the likelihood of successfully completing, a clinical trial. If we or our subsidiaries experience delays in the completion of, or if we must suspend or terminate, any clinical trial of any product candidate, our ability to obtain regulatory approval for that product candidate will be delayed and the commercial prospects, if any, for the product candidate may suffer as a result. In addition, many of these factors may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate.\nEven if approved, any product candidates that we or our subsidiaries may develop and market may be later withdrawn from the market or subject to promotional limitations.\nNeither we nor our subsidiaries may be able to obtain the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the promotion of our product candidates if approved. We and our subsidiaries may also be required to undertake post-marketing clinical trials. If the results of such post-marketing studies are not satisfactory or if adverse events or other safety issues arise after approval, the FDA or a comparable regulatory agency in another country may withdraw marketing authorization or may condition continued marketing on commitments from us or our subsidiaries that may be expensive and/or time consuming to complete. In addition, if we or others identify adverse side effects after any of our or our subsidiaries\u2019 products are on the market, or if manufacturing problems occur, regulatory approval may be withdrawn and reformulation of our or our subsidiaries\u2019 products, additional clinical trials, changes in labeling of our or our subsidiaries\u2019 products and additional marketing applications may be required. Any reformulation or labeling changes may limit the marketability of such products if approved.\nWe and our subsidiaries currently rely on third parties to manufacture our preclinical and clinical pharmaceutical supplies and expect to continue to rely on them and other contractors to produce commercial supplies of our products, and our dependence on third-party suppliers could adversely impact our business.\nWe depend on third party manufacturers for product supply. If our or our subsidiaries\u2019 contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and with FDA regulatory requirements, we will not be able to secure and/or maintain FDA approval for those products. Our and our subsidiaries\u2019 third-party suppliers will be required to maintain compliance with cGMPs and will be subject to inspections by the FDA and comparable agencies in other jurisdictions to confirm such compliance. In the event that the FDA or such other agencies determine that our third-party suppliers have not complied with cGMP, the relevant clinical trials could be terminated or subjected to a clinical hold until such time as we are able to obtain appropriate replacement material. Any delay, interruption or other issues that arise in the manufacture, packaging, or storage of our products as a result of a failure of the facilities or operations of our third-party suppliers to pass any regulatory agency inspection could significantly impair our ability to develop and commercialize our and our subsidiaries\u2019 products.\nWe and our subsidiaries also rely on our manufacturers to purchase from third-party suppliers the materials necessary to produce product candidates for anticipated clinical trials. There are a small number of suppliers for certain capital equipment and raw materials that are used to manufacture those products. We do not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these raw materials by our manufacturers. Moreover, we currently do not have any agreements for the commercial production of these raw materials. Any significant delay in the supply the raw material components for an ongoing clinical trial could considerably delay completion of our clinical trials, product testing and potential regulatory approval.\nWe do not expect to have the resources or capacity to commercially manufacture our and our subsidiaries\u2019 products, if approved, and will likely continue to be dependent upon third-party manufacturers. Our dependence on third parties to manufacture and supply clinical trial materials and any approved products may adversely affect our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to develop and commercialize products on a timely basis or at all.\nWe and our subsidiaries rely on third parties to conduct clinical trials. If these third parties do not meet agreed upon deadlines or otherwise conduct the trials as required, our or our subsidiaries\u2019 clinical development programs could be delayed or unsuccessful and neither we nor our subsidiaries may be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates when expected or at all.\nNeither we nor our subsidiaries have the ability to conduct all aspects of our preclinical testing or clinical trials ourselves. We and our subsidiaries intend to and do use CROs to conduct planned clinical trials and will and do rely upon such CROs, as well as medical institutions, clinical investigators and consultants, to conduct our trials in accordance with specified clinical protocols. These CROs, investigators and other third parties will and do play a significant role in the conduct of our and our subsidiaries\u2019 trials and the subsequent collection and analysis of data from the clinical trials.\nThere is no guarantee that any CROs, investigators and other third parties upon which we and our subsidiaries rely for administration and conduct of our clinical trials will devote adequate time and resources to such trials or perform as contractually required. If any of these third parties fail to meet expected deadlines, fail to adhere to our clinical protocols or otherwise perform in a substandard manner, our or our subsidiaries\u2019 clinical trials may be extended delayed or terminated. If any of the clinical trial sites terminate for any reason, we or our subsidiaries may lose follow-up information on patients enrolled in our ongoing clinical trials unless the care of those patients is transferred to another qualified clinical trial site. In addition, principal investigators for our and our subsidiaries\u2019 clinical trials may serve as scientific advisers or consultants to us from time to time and receive cash or equity compensation in connection with such services. If these relationships and any related compensation result in perceived or actual conflicts of interest, the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site may be jeopardized.\nIf our competitors develop treatments for any of the target indications of our or our subsidiaries\u2019 product candidates that are approved more quickly, marketed more successfully or demonstrated to be more effective, the commercial opportunity with respect to that product candidate will be reduced or eliminated.\nWe and our subsidiaries operate in highly competitive segments of the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical markets and face competition from many different sources, including commercial pharmaceutical and biotechnology enterprises, academic institutions, government agencies, and private and public research institutions. Our and our subsidiaries\u2019 product candidates, if successfully developed and approved, will compete with established therapies, as well as new treatments that may be introduced by our competitors. Many of our and our subsidiaries\u2019 competitors have significantly greater financial, product development, manufacturing and marketing resources than us. Large pharmaceutical companies have extensive experience in clinical testing and obtaining regulatory approval for drugs. In addition, many universities and private and public research institutes are active in cancer research, some in direct competition with us. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. New developments, including the development of other biological and pharmaceutical technologies and methods of treating disease, occur in the pharmaceutical and life sciences industries at a rapid pace. Developments by competitors may render our and our subsidiaries\u2019 product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive. We and our subsidiaries will also face competition from these third parties in establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials and in identifying and in-licensing new product candidates.\nIf we or our subsidiaries are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or fail to enter into agreements with third parties to market, distribute and sell products that may be successfully developed, neither we nor our subsidiaries may be able to effectively market and sell products and generate product revenue.\nNeither we nor our subsidiaries (other than Journey Medical Corporation) currently have the infrastructure for the sales, marketing and distribution of any of our product candidates, and we and our subsidiaries must build this infrastructure or make arrangements with third parties to perform these functions in order to commercialize any products that we may successfully develop. The establishment and development of a sales force, either by us, any of our subsidiaries or jointly with a partner, or the establishment of a contract sales force to market any products we or our subsidiaries may develop will be expensive and time-consuming and could delay any product launch. If we, our subsidiaries, or our respective partners, are unable to establish sales and marketing capability or any other non-technical capabilities necessary to commercialize any products that may be successfully developed, we or our subsidiaries will need to contract with third parties to market and sell such products. We or our subsidiaries may not be able to establish arrangements with third parties on acceptable terms, or at all.\nIf any of our or our subsidiaries\u2019 product candidates that are successfully developed do not achieve broad market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and the medical community, the revenues that any such product candidates generate from sales will be limited.\nEven if our or our subsidiaries\u2019 product candidates receive regulatory approval, they may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and the medical community. Coverage and reimbursement of our or our subsidiaries\u2019 product candidates by third-party payors, including government payors, generally is also necessary for commercial success. The degree of market acceptance of any approved products will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7 the efficacy and safety as demonstrated in clinical trials;\n\u00b7 the clinical indications for which the product is approved;\n\u00b7 acceptance by physicians, major operators of hospitals and clinics and patients of the product as a safe and effective treatment;\n\u00b7 acceptance of the product by the target population;\n\u00b7 the potential and perceived advantages of product candidates over alternative treatments;\n\u00b7 the safety of product candidates seen in a broader patient group, including its use outside the approved indications;\n\u00b7 the cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments;\n\u00b7 the availability of adequate reimbursement and pricing by third parties and government authorities;\n\u00b7 relative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u00b7 the prevalence and severity of adverse events;\n\u00b7 the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts; and\n\u00b7 unfavorable publicity relating to the product.\nIf any product candidate is approved but does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, hospitals, healthcare payors and patients, we or our subsidiaries may not generate sufficient revenue from these products and in turn we may not become or remain profitable.\nWe or our subsidiaries may incur substantial product liability or indemnification claims relating to the clinical testing of product candidates.\nWe and our subsidiaries face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of product candidates in human clinical trials, and claims could be brought against us if use or misuse of one of our or our subsidiaries\u2019 product candidates causes, or merely appears to have caused, personal injury or death. While we and our subsidiaries have and/or intend to maintain product liability insurance relating to clinical trials, that coverage may not be sufficient to cover potential claims and we or our subsidiaries may be unable to maintain such insurance. Any claims against us or our subsidiaries, regardless of their merit, could severely harm our or our subsidiaries\u2019 financial condition, strain management and other resources or destroy the prospects for commercialization of the product which is the subject of any such claim. We are unable to predict if we or our subsidiaries will be able to obtain or maintain product liability insurance for any products that may be approved for marketing. Additionally, we and our subsidiaries have entered into various agreements where we indemnify third parties for certain claims relating to product candidates. These indemnification obligations may require us or our subsidiaries to pay significant sums of money for claims that are covered by these indemnifications.\nHealthcare reform and restrictions on reimbursements may limit our financial returns.\nOur ability and the ability of our subsidiaries and all of our respective collaborators to commercialize product candidates that are successfully developed may depend, in part, on the extent to which government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations will reimburse consumers for the cost of these products. These third parties are increasingly challenging both the need for and the price of new drug products. Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutics. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available for our or our subsidiaries\u2019 product candidates, which would prevent those product candidates from selling at price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on investments in research and product development.\nWe and our subsidiaries use biological materials and may use hazardous materials, and any claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of these materials could be time consuming and costly.\nWe and our subsidiaries may use hazardous materials, including chemicals and biological agents and compounds that could be dangerous to human health and safety or the environment. Our and our subsidiaries\u2019 operations may also produce hazardous waste products. Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the use, generation, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and wastes. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations may be expensive, and current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our product development efforts. In addition, neither we nor our subsidiaries can entirely eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from these materials or wastes. Neither we nor our subsidiaries carry specific biological or hazardous waste insurance coverage and our property and casualty and general liability insurance policies specifically exclude coverage for damages and fines arising from biological or hazardous waste exposure or contamination. Accordingly, in the event of contamination or injury, we or any of our subsidiaries could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines in an amount exceeding our respective resources, and clinical trials or regulatory approvals could be suspended.\nAlthough we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover costs and expenses incurred due to injuries to our and our subsidiaries\u2019 employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. Neither we nor our subsidiaries maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted in connection with the storage or disposal of biological or hazardous materials.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nOur success depends upon our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property rights and take advantage of certain regulatory market exclusivity periods.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to obtain patent protection for product candidates and their formulations and uses. The patent application process is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that we, our subsidiaries, or our respective partners will be successful by obtaining patents. These risks and uncertainties include the following:\n\u00b7 patent applications may not result in any patents being issued;\n\u00b7 our and our subsidiaries\u2019 competitors, many of which have substantially greater resources than us, our subsidiaries, or our partners, and many of which have made significant investments in competing technologies, may seek, or may already have obtained, patents that may limit or interfere with our or our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to make, use, and sell potential product candidates;\n\u00b7 there may be significant pressure on the U.S. government and other international governmental bodies to limit the scope of patent protection both inside and outside the United States for disease treatments that prove successful as a matter of public policy regarding worldwide health concerns; and\n\u00b7 countries other than the United States may have patent laws less favorable to patentees than those upheld by U.S. courts, allowing foreign competitors a better opportunity to create, develop and market competing products.\nIn addition, patents that may be issued or in-licensed may be challenged, invalidated, modified, revoked, circumvented, found to be unenforceable, or otherwise may not provide any competitive advantage. Third parties are often responsible for maintaining patent protection for our product candidates and those of our subsidiaries. For example, UCLB is responsible for prosecuting and maintaining patent protection for CNDO-109, at our expense for our territories. If UCLB fails to appropriately prosecute and maintain patent protection for this product candidate, our ability to develop and commercialize CNDO-109 may be adversely affected and we may not be able to prevent competitors from making, using and selling competing products. This failure to properly protect intellectual property rights relating to any of our or our subsidiaries\u2019 product candidates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, U.S. patent laws may change, which could prevent or limit us or our subsidiaries from filing patent applications or patent claims to protect products and/or technologies or limit the exclusivity periods that are available to patent holders. For example, on September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (the \u201cLeahy-Smith Act\u201d), was signed into law, and includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include changes to transition from a \u201cfirst-to-invent\u201d system to a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system and to the way issued patents are challenged. These changes may favor larger and more established companies that have more resources to devote to patent application filing and prosecution. The PTO implemented the America Invents Act on March 16, 2013, and it remains to be seen how the judicial system and the PTO will interpret and enforce these new laws. Accordingly, it is not clear how the Leahy-Smith Act will affect the cost to prosecute patent applications, the ability to obtain patents based on discoveries or the ability to enforce or defend issued patents, all of which issues would materially impact us.\nWe and our subsidiaries and our respective partners also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how to protect product candidates. Although we have taken steps to protect our and our subsidiaries\u2019 trade secrets and unpatented know-how, including entering into confidentiality agreements with third parties, and confidential information and inventions agreements with employees, consultants and advisers, third parties may still obtain this information or come upon this same or similar information independently.\nWe also may rely on the regulatory period of market exclusivity for any of our or our subsidiaries\u2019 biologic product candidates that are successfully developed and approved for commercialization. Although this period in the United States is currently 12 years from the date of marketing approval, there is a risk that the U.S. Congress could amend laws to significantly shorten this exclusivity period, as proposed by President Obama. Once any regulatory period of exclusivity expires, depending on the status of our and our subsidiaries\u2019 patent coverage and the nature of the product, we may not be able to prevent others from marketing products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with our or our subsidiaries\u2019 products, which would materially adversely affect us.\nIf we, our subsidiaries or our respective partners are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, it will be costly and time consuming, and an unfavorable outcome in that litigation would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur success also depends on our ability, our subsidiaries\u2019 ability and the ability of any of our respective current or future collaborators to develop, manufacture, market and sell product candidates without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we and our subsidiaries are developing products, some of which may be directed at claims that overlap with the subject matter of our or our subsidiaries\u2019 intellectual property. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us, which may later result in issued patents that our or our subsidiaries\u2019 product candidates or proprietary technologies may infringe. Similarly, there may be issued patents relevant to our or our subsidiaries\u2019 product candidates of which we are not aware.\nThere is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries generally. If a third party claims that we, our subsidiaries or any of our respective licensors, suppliers or collaborators infringe the third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we or our subsidiaries may have to:\n\u00b7 obtain licenses, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all;\n\u00b7 abandon an infringing product candidate or redesign products or processes to avoid infringement;\n\u00b7 pay substantial damages, including the possibility of treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees, if a court decides that the product or proprietary technology at issue infringes on or violates the third party\u2019s rights;\n\u00b7 pay substantial royalties, fees and/or grant cross-licenses to product candidates; and/or\n\u00b7 defend litigation or administrative proceedings which may be costly regardless of outcome, and which could result in a substantial diversion of financial and management resources.\nWe or our subsidiaries may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce patents or the patents of licensors, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our or our subsidiaries\u2019 patents or the patents of our respective licensors. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time consuming. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our or our subsidiaries\u2019 patents at risk of being invalidated, found to be unenforceable, or interpreted narrowly and could likewise put patent applications at risk of not issuing. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our or our subsidiaries\u2019 confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation.\nWe or our subsidiaries may be subject to claims that our or our subsidiaries\u2019 consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed to us or our subsidiaries alleged trade secrets of their other clients or former employers.\nAs is common in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry, we and our subsidiaries engage the services of consultants to assist in the development of product candidates. Many of these consultants were previously employed at, or may have previously been or are currently providing consulting services to, other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our and our subsidiaries\u2019 competitors or potential competitors. We or our subsidiaries may become subject to claims related to whether these consultants have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers or their former or current customers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we or our subsidiaries are successful in defending these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nAny product for which we or our subsidiaries obtain marketing approval could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market and we or our subsidiaries may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with products, when and if any of them are approved.\nAny product for which we or our subsidiaries obtain marketing approval, along with the manufacturing processes and facilities, post-approval clinical data, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such product, will be subject to continual requirements of and review by the FDA and comparable regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration requirements, cGMP requirements relating to quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping. Even if we or our subsidiaries obtain regulatory approval of a product, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. We or our subsidiaries also may be subject to state laws and registration requirements covering the distribution of products. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in actions such as:\n\u00b7 restrictions on such products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes;\n\u00b7 warning letters;\n\u00b7 withdrawal of the products from the market;\n\u00b7 refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we or our subsidiaries submit;\n\u00b7 voluntary or mandatory recall;\n\u00b7 fines;\n\u00b7 suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals or refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we or our subsidiaries submit;\n\u00b7 refusal to permit the import or export of products;\n\u00b7 product seizure or detentions;\n\u00b7 injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and\n\u00b7 adverse publicity.\nIf we, our subsidiaries or our respective suppliers, third-party contractors, clinical investigators or collaborators are slow to adapt, or are unable to adapt, to changes in existing regulatory requirements or adoption of new regulatory requirements or policies, we, our subsidiaries, or our respective collaborators may lose marketing approval for products when and if any of them are approved, resulting in decreased revenue from milestones, product sales or royalties.\nRisks Relating to our Finances, Capital Requirements and Other Financial Matters\nWe are an early-stage company with a history of operating losses that is expected to continue and we are unable to predict the extent of future losses, whether we will generate significant or any revenues or whether we will achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe are an early-stage company and our prospects must be considered in light of the uncertainties, risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of operations. We continue to generate operating losses in all periods including losses from operations of approximately $35.8 million, $20.7 million and $50.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. At December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $190.2 million. We expect to make substantial expenditures and incur increasing operating costs and interest expense in the future and our accumulated deficit will increase significantly as we expand development and clinical trial activities for our product candidates and finance investments in our existing and new subsidiaries in accordance with our growth strategy. Our losses have had, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse impact on our working capital, total assets and stockholders\u2019 equity. Because of the risks and uncertainties associated with product development and our investments in our subsidiaries, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses, whether we will ever generate significant or any revenues or if we will ever achieve or sustain profitability.\nAt December 31, 2015, the amount of debt outstanding under our promissory note in favor of Israel Discount Bank of New York (\u201cIDB\u201d) was $14.0 million. The loan is collateralized by a security interest, a general lien upon, and right of set off against, our money market account of $15.0 million. If we default on our obligations, IDB may declare the loan immediately payable together with accrued interest and exercise its right to set-off. If an event of default occurs, we may not be able to cure it within any applicable cure period, if at all. If the maturity of our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available for repayment or we may not have the ability to borrow or obtain sufficient funds to replace the accelerated indebtedness on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, the promissory note with IDB may limit our ability to finance future operations or satisfy capital needs or to engage in, expand or pursue our business activities. It may also prevent us from engaging in activities that could be beneficial to our business and our stockholders unless we repay the outstanding debt, which may not be desirable or possible.\nWe may need substantial additional funding and may be unable to raise capital when needed, which may force us to delay, curtail or eliminate one or more of our R&D programs and commercialization efforts and potentially change our growth strategy.\nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception. During the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015 we incurred R&D expenses of approximately $25.7 million, $10.2 million and $29.8 million, respectively. We expect to continue to spend significant amounts on our growth strategy. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2015, will enable us to continue to fund operations in the normal course of business for at least the next 12 months. In addition, in February 2015, we raised $10.0 million in a private placement of a promissory note to NSC Biotech Venture Fund I LLC. However, until such time, if ever, as we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue and achieve profitability, we expect to seek to finance potential, longer-term cash needs. Our ability to obtain additional funding when needed, changes to our operating plans, our existing and anticipated working capital needs, the acceleration or modification of our planned R&D activities, expenditures and growth strategy, increased expenses or other events may affect our need for additional capital in the future and require us to seek additional funding sooner than anticipated. In addition, if we are unable to raise additional capital when needed, we might have to delay, curtail or eliminate one or more of our R&D programs and commercialization efforts and potentially change our growth strategy.\nRaising additional funds by issuing securities or through licensing or lending arrangements may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, the share ownership of existing stockholders will be diluted. Any future debt financing may involve covenants that restrict our operations, including limitations on our ability to incur liens or additional debt, pay dividends, redeem our stock, make certain investments and engage in certain merger, consolidation or asset sale transactions, among other restrictions. In addition, if we raise additional funds through licensing arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish potentially valuable rights to our or our subsidiaries\u2019 product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, investors\u2019 views of us and, as a result, the value of our Common Stock.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and related rules, our management is required to report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation. To comply with the requirements of being a reporting company under the Exchange Act, we may need to further upgrade our systems, including information technology, implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures and hire additional accounting and finance staff. If material weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal controls exist and go undetected, our financial statements could contain material misstatements that, when discovered in the future could cause us to fail to meet our future reporting obligations and cause the price of our Common Stock to decline.\nRisks Associated with our Capital Stock\nSome of our executives, directors and principal stockholders can control our direction and policies, and their interests may be adverse to the interests of our other stockholders.\nAt December 31, 2015, Lindsay A. Rosenwald, M.D., our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, beneficially owned 12.2% of our issued and outstanding capital stock. At December 31, 2015, Michael S. Weiss, our Executive Vice Chairman, Strategic Development, beneficially owned 14.8% of our issued and outstanding capital stock. By virtue of their holdings and membership on our Board of Directors, Dr. Rosenwald and Mr. Weiss may individually influence our management and our affairs and may make it difficult for us to consummate corporate transactions such as mergers, consolidations or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets that may be favorable from our standpoint or that of our other stockholders.\nIn addition, several of our directors may influence the election of members to our Board of Directors. On February 20, 2014, Drs. Harvey, Rosenwald and Rowinsky and Messrs. Klein, Lobell and Weiss, entered into a Shareholders\u2019 Agreement, pursuant to which they agreed that, until the end of our annual meeting held in calendar year 2016 and so long as Dr. Rosenwald and Mr. Weiss are on the proposed slate of directors to be nominated, they each will vote all of their shares of our Common Stock in favor of electing those individuals, and only those individuals, to our Board of Directors whom our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee proposes. Until that time, they also agreed to not publicly or otherwise advocate for or encourage in any way (outside of fulfilling their director duties) the election of any individual to our Board of Directors whom is not proposed by our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.\nThe market price of our Common Stock may be volatile and may fluctuate in a way that is disproportionate to our operating performance.\nOur stock price may experience substantial volatility as a result of a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7 announcements we make regarding our or our subsidiaries\u2019 current product candidates, the acquisition of potential new product candidates and/or in-licensing through multiple subsidiaries;\n\u00b7 sales or potential sales of substantial amounts of our Common Stock;\n\u00b7 our or our subsidiaries\u2019 delay or failure in initiating or completing pre-clinical or clinical trials or unsatisfactory results of any of these trials;\n\u00b7 announcements about us, our subsidiaries or about our competitors, including clinical trial results, regulatory approvals or new product introductions;\n\u00b7 developments concerning our or our subsidiaries\u2019 licensors and/or product manufacturers;\n\u00b7 litigation and other developments relating to our or our subsidiaries\u2019 patents or other proprietary rights or those of our competitors;\n\u00b7 conditions in the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries;\n\u00b7 governmental regulation and legislation;\n\u00b7 variations in our anticipated or actual operating results; and\n\u00b7 change in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our performance, or our failure to meet analysts\u2019 expectations.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control. The stock markets in general, and the market for pharmaceutical and biotechnological companies in particular, have historically experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. These broad market and industry factors could reduce the market price of our Common Stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock, or the perception that such sales may occur, may adversely impact the price of our Common Stock.\nAlmost all of the 47.1 million outstanding shares of our Common Stock as of December 31, 2015, are available for sale in the public market, either pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), or an effective registration statement. In addition, in July 2013, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3, which was declared effective on August 19, 2013. Under the 2013 Form S-3 and an amended At-Market Issuance Sales Agreement entered into with MLV LLC in connection therewith (the \u201c2013 ATM\u201d), we may offer and sell shares of our Common Stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $70.0 million. As of December 31, 2015, approximately $54 million remains available for issuance under the 2013 ATM.\nWe have never paid and do not intend to pay cash dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on any of our capital stock and we currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. In addition, the terms of existing and future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our Common Stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our Company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our Common Stock.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and Delaware law may have the effect of deterring unsolicited takeovers or delaying or preventing a change in control of our Company or changes in our management, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then-current market prices. In addition, these provisions may limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests. These provisions include:\n\u00b7 the inability of stockholders to call special meetings; and\n\u00b7 the ability of our Board of Directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could include the right to approve an acquisition or other change in our control or could be used to institute a rights plan, also known as a poison pill, that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, likely preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our Board of Directors.\nIn addition, the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder, generally a person which together with its affiliates owns, or within the last three years, has owned 15% of our voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nThe existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our Common Stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our Company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your Common Stock in an acquisition.", "PERMNO": 13159, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "FBIO"}
