{"cik": "1574197", "company": "Five Point Holdings, LLC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-30", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following material risks, as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and the related notes. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In such an event, the trading price of our Class A common shares could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Real Estate\nOur performance is subject to risks associated with the real estate industry.\nOur economic performance is subject to various risks and fluctuations in value and demand, many of which are beyond our control. Certain factors that affect real estate generally and our properties specifically may adversely affect our revenue from land sales or leasing of retail or other commercial space. The following factors, among others, may adversely affect the real estate industry, including our properties, and could therefore adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations:\n\u2022\ndownturns in economic conditions or demographic changes at the national, regional or local levels, particularly in the areas where our properties are located;\n\u2022\nsignificant job losses and unemployment levels, which may decrease demand for our properties;\n\u2022\ncompetition from other residential communities, retail properties, office properties or other commercial space;\n\u2022\ninflation or increases in interest rates;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the availability, or increases in the cost, of financing for homebuilders, commercial builders or commercial buyers or mortgage financing for homebuyers;\n\u2022\nlimitations, reductions or eliminations of tax benefits for homeowners;\n\u2022\nreductions in the level of demand for homes or retail or other commercial space in the areas where our properties are located;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in energy costs;\n\u2022\ndecreases in the underlying value of properties in the areas where our properties are located;\n\u2022\nincreases in the supply of homes or retail or other commercial space in the areas where our properties are located;\n\u2022\ndeclines in consumer confidence and spending; and\n\u2022\npublic perception that any of the above events may occur.\nThere are significant risks associated with our development and construction projects that may prevent completion on budget and on schedule.\nAt our projects, we are engaged in extensive construction activity to develop each community\u2019s infrastructure, including grading and installing roads, sidewalks, gutters, utility improvements (such as storm drains, water, gas, sewer, power and communications), landscaping and shared amenities (such as community buildings,\nneighborhood parks, trails and open spaces) and other actions necessary to prepare each residential and commercial lot for construction. In addition, although we primarily rely on homebuilders to purchase homesites at our communities and construct homes, we may in the future construct a portion of the homes ourselves. For commercial or multi-family properties that we retain or acquire in the future, we may also construct the buildings ourselves. Our development and construction activities entail risks that could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations, including:\n\u2022\nconstruction costs, which may exceed our original estimates due to increases in materials, labor or other costs, which could make the project less profitable;\n\u2022\npermitting or construction delays, which may result in increased debt service expense and increased project costs, as well as deferred revenue;\n\u2022\nunavailability of raw materials when needed, which may result in project delays, stoppages or interruptions, which could make the project less profitable;\n\u2022\nfederal, state and local grants to complete certain highways, interchange, bridge projects or other public improvements may not be available, which could increase costs and make the project less profitable;\n\u2022\nclaims for warranty, product liability and construction defects after a property has been built;\n\u2022\nclaims for injuries that occur in the course of construction activities;\n\u2022\npoor performance or nonperformance by, or disputes with, any of our contractors, subcontractors or other third parties on whom we rely;\n\u2022\nhealth and safety incidents and site accidents;\n\u2022\nunforeseen engineering, environmental or geological problems, which may result in delays or increased costs;\n\u2022\nlabor stoppages, slowdowns or interruptions;\n\u2022\ncompliance with environmental planning and protection regulations and related legal proceedings;\n\u2022\nliabilities, expenses or project delays, stoppages or interruptions as a result of challenges by third parties in legal proceedings;\n\u2022\ndelay or inability to acquire property, rights of way or easements, which may result in delays or increased costs; and\n\u2022\nweather-related and geological interference, including landslides, earthquakes, floods, drought, wildfires and other events, which may result in delays or increased costs.\nIn addition, at The San Francisco Shipyard, certain parcels of land will not be conveyed to the San Francisco Venture until the U.S. Navy satisfactorily completes its finding of suitability to transfer process. In the event that the U.S. Navy takes longer than expected to complete its finding of suitability to transfer process, we may be forced to delay development of portions of The San Francisco Shipyard until such parcels are conveyed. Allegations that a contractor hired by the U.S. Navy misrepresented its sampling work at The San Francisco Shipyard have resulted in data reevaluation, governmental investigations, and a determination by the U.S. Navy to undertake additional sampling, which could slow the remaining land transfers from the U.S. Navy, which could in turn delay or impede our future development of such parcels.\nAt Newhall Ranch, we are party to royalty-based lease agreements with oil and gas operators. Pursuant to the terms of these leases, the oil and gas operators are required to remediate certain environmental impacts caused by their operations following expiration of such leases. In the event that they take longer than expected to complete such remediation or default in their obligation, such that we are required to complete such remediation, we may be forced to delay development of Newhall Ranch until such remediation is complete or incur additional costs that are currently obligations of the oil and gas operators.\nWe cannot assure you that projects will be completed on schedule or that construction costs will not exceed budgeted amounts. Failure to complete development or construction activities on budget or on schedule may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nZoning and land use laws and regulations may increase our expenses, limit the number of homes or commercial square footage that can be built or delay completion of our projects and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough there are agreements with the City of Irvine for Great Park Neighborhoods and the City and County of San Francisco for The San Francisco Shipyard and Candlestick Point that protect existing entitlements, our communities are subject to numerous local, state, and federal laws and other statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, development, building design, construction and similar matters that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes or commercial square feet that can eventually be built within the boundaries of a particular area, as well as governmental taxes, fees and levies on the acquisition and development of land parcels. These regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities as to the conditions for our projects being approved, if approved at all. Further, if the terms and conditions of the development agreements with the Cities of Irvine and San Francisco are not complied with, existing entitlements under those agreements could be lost, including (in the case of San Francisco) the right to acquire certain portions of the land on which development activity is expected. New housing and commercial developments are often subject to determinations by the administering governmental authorities as to the adequacy of water and sewage facilities, roads and other local services, and may also be subject to various assessments for schools, parks, streets, affordable housing and other public improvements. As a result, the development of properties may be subject to periodic delays in certain areas due to the conditions imposed by the administering governmental authorities. Due to building moratoriums, zoning changes or \u201cslow-growth\u201d or \u201cno-growth\u201d initiatives that could be implemented in the future in the areas in which our properties are located, our communities may also be subject to periodic delays, or we could be precluded entirely from developing in certain communities or otherwise restricted in our business activities. Such moratoriums or zoning changes can occur prior or subsequent to commencement of our development operations, without notice or recourse. Local and state governments also have broad discretion regarding the imposition of development fees for projects in their jurisdictions. Projects for which we have received land use and development entitlements or approvals may still require a variety of other governmental approvals and permits during the development process and can also be impacted adversely by unforeseen health, safety, and welfare issues, which can further delay these projects or prevent their development. As a result, revenue from land sales or leasing of retail or other commercial space may be adversely affected, or costs may increase, which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, laws and regulations governing the approval processes provide third parties the opportunity to challenge proposed plans and approvals. Certain of our plans and approvals have been challenged by third parties, such as environmental groups, and are currently the subject of ongoing legal proceedings. These and any future third-party challenges to our planned developments provide additional uncertainties in real estate development planning and entitlements. Third-party challenges in the form of litigation could result in the denial of our right to develop in accordance with our current development plans or could adversely affect the length of time or the cost required to obtain the necessary governmental approvals to develop. In addition, adverse decisions arising from any litigation could increase the cost and length of time to obtain ultimate approval of a project and could adversely affect the design, scope, plans and profitability of a project, which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe incur significant costs, and may be subject to delays, in obtaining entitlements, permits and approvals before we can begin development or construction of our projects and begin to recover our costs.\nBefore any of our projects can generate revenues, we make material expenditures to obtain entitlements, permits and development approvals. It generally takes several years to complete this process and completion times vary based on complexity of the project and the community and regulatory issues involved. We could also be subject to delays in construction, which could lead to higher costs and adversely affect our results of operations. Changing market conditions during the entitlement and construction periods could negatively impact our revenue from land\nsales or leasing of retail or other commercial space. As a result of the time and complexity involved in construction and obtaining approvals for our projects, we face the risk that demand for residential and commercial properties may decline and we may be forced to sell or lease properties at prices or rates that generate lower profit margins than we anticipated, or would result in losses. If values decline, we may be required to make material write-downs of the book value of our real estate assets or real estate investments.\nIn November 2015, the Supreme Court of California issued a ruling under the CEQA and other state statutes, which required the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (\u201cCDFW\u201d) to reassess certain analyses and determinations related to greenhouse gas emissions and the protection of a certain fish species completed by CDFW in connection with approving the EIR for Newhall Ranch. In June 2017, CDFW certified the final additional environmental analysis and reapproved the Newhall Ranch project and related state permits. The ruling also required Los Angeles County to reassess its analyses and determinations related to greenhouse gas emissions in connection with the EIR and to reassess its previous related approvals. Although the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors certified the final additional environmental analysis, in combination with the 2011 EIR, and reapproved the Landmark Village and Mission Village development areas within Newhall Ranch along with related project approvals and permits in July 2017, the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling resulted in the need to reassess certain elements of the project\u2019s potential impacts and to modify certain aspects (such as specific mitigation measures and project design features) related to the development plan for Newhall Ranch, which increased our costs. The ruling has resulted in delays in construction and it could result in further delays beyond those currently anticipated, or in changes in the sequencing of our communities. Furthermore, the petitioners that have pending challenges to certain approvals for Newhall Ranch have filed objections to CDFW\u2019s June 2017 reapproval actions and have filed a new challenge to Los Angeles County\u2019s July 2017 reapproval actions.\nWe will have to make significant investments at our properties before we realize significant revenues.\nWe currently plan to spend material amounts on horizontal development at our communities. Those expenditures primarily reflect the costs of developing the infrastructure at our properties, including grading and installing roads, sidewalks, gutters, utility improvements (such as storm drains, water, gas, sewer, power and communications), landscaping and shared amenities (such as community buildings, neighborhood parks, trails and open spaces) and other actions necessary to prepare each residential and commercial lot for construction. We currently expect to have sufficient capital to fund the horizontal development of our communities in accordance with our development plan for several years. However, we may experience cost increases, our plans may change, new regulations and regulatory plan modifications or court rulings may affect our ability to develop or the cost to develop the project or circumstances may arise that result in our needing additional capital to execute our development plan. If we are not successful in obtaining additional financing to enable us to complete our projects, we may experience further delays or increased costs, and our financial condition and results of our operations may be adversely affected.\nOur projects are subject to environmental planning and protection laws and regulations that require us to obtain permits and approvals that may be delayed, withheld or challenged by third parties in legal proceedings.\nOur projects are subject to various environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations require us to obtain and maintain permits and approvals, undergo environmental review processes and implement environmental and health and safety programs and procedures to mitigate the physical impact our communities will have on the environment (such as traffic impacts, health and safety impacts, impacts on public services and impacts on endangered, threatened or other protected plants and species) and to control risks associated with the siting, development, construction and operation of our projects, all of which involve a significant investment of time and expense. The particular environmental requirements that apply to a project vary depending on, among other things, location, environmental conditions, current and former uses of a property, the presence or absence of certain wildlife or habitats, and nearby conditions. We expect that increasingly stringent environmental requirements will be imposed on developers in the future.\nThese future environmental requirements could affect the timing or cost of our development. In addition, future environmental requirements could reduce the number of homesites or amount of commercial square feet we are able to develop, increase our financial commitments to local or state agencies or organizations or otherwise\nreduce the profitability of the project. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations and permit requirements may result in delays, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, denial or revocation of permits or other authorizations, other liabilities and costs, the issuance of injunctions to limit or cease operations and the imposition of additional requirements for future compliance as a result of past failures.\nCertain of our environmental permits and approvals have been challenged by third parties, such as environmental groups, and are currently the subject of ongoing legal proceedings. Future environmental permits and approvals that we will need to obtain for development areas within our communities may be similarly challenged.\nWe could incur significant costs related to regulation of and litigation over the presence of asbestos-containing materials at our properties.\nEnvironmental laws govern the control, presence, maintenance and removal of ACM. Such laws may impose fines and penalties, and, on occasion, we have had such penalties imposed against us, for failure to comply with these requirements. Such laws require that owners or operators of buildings or properties containing ACM properly manage and maintain it, adequately notify or train those who may come into contact with it, and undertake special precautions including asbestos dust monitoring, removal or other abatement if asbestos would be disturbed during construction, renovation or demolition activities. Certain buildings on our properties that are being and will be demolished (or have already been demolished) in connection with our development plans, and the soil at certain of our properties, contain ACM which must be handled in accordance with these laws. Such laws may increase our development costs, and subject us to fines and penalties and other liabilities and costs in the event compliance is not maintained. We have also been exposed to legal proceedings initiated by third parties and may in the future be exposed to third party liability (such as liability for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos).\nAs an owner and operator of real property, we could incur liability for environmental contamination issues.\nWe have incurred costs and expended funds, and may do so again in the future, to comply with environmental requirements, such as those relating to discharges or threatened discharges to air, water and land, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and the cleanup of properties affected by hazardous substances. Under these and other environmental requirements, as a property owner or operator, we may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at our communities or properties currently or formerly owned or operated by us, including as a result of the current and former oil and gas leasing operations at Newhall Ranch or as a result of prior activities conducted at the El Toro Base or The San Francisco Shipyard. Some of our properties have been or may be impacted by contamination arising from these or other prior uses of these properties, or adjacent properties. In this regard, certain portions of the El Toro Base and The San Francisco Shipyard have been or currently are listed on the USEPA\u2019s National Priorities List as sites requiring cleanup under federal environmental law. Although the U.S. Navy has been primarily responsible for investigation and cleanup activities at these properties and will continue to have liability for future contamination that is discovered, we also may incur costs for investigation or cleanup of contamination that is discovered or disturbed during the course of our future development activities or otherwise. Similarly, in the event that oil and gas operators at Newhall Ranch do not fully remediate contamination resulting from such operations, we may incur such costs. As an owner and operator of real property, we could be held responsible to a governmental entity or third parties for property damage, personal injury and investigation and cleanup costs incurred by them in connection with any contamination at or from such real property. We may also be liable for the costs of remediating contamination at off-site disposal or treatment facilities when we arrange for disposal or treatment of hazardous substances or waste at such facilities, without regard to whether we comply with environmental laws in doing so.\nEnvironmental laws and requirements typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. The liability under the laws related to such requirements has been interpreted to be joint and several, meaning a governmental entity or third party may seek recovery of the entire amount from us even if there are other responsible parties, unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis for allocation of the responsibility. The costs of investigation, remediation or removal of those substances, or fines, penalties and other sanctions and damages from third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, may be substantial, and the presence of those substances, or the failure to remediate a property properly, may impair our ability to sell, lease or otherwise use our property. While we currently\nhave and may maintain insurance policies from time to time to mitigate some or all of these risks, insurance coverage for such claims may be limited or nonexistent. In addition, to the extent that we have indemnification rights against third parties relating to any such environmental liability or remediation costs (such as, for example, the U.S. Navy under certain federal laws as a former owner and operator of the El Toro Base and The San Francisco Shipyard, and former oil and gas lessees under certain settlement agreements relating to portions of Newhall Ranch), the indemnification may not fully cover such costs or we may not be able to collect the full amount of the indemnification from the third party. While investigation and cleanup activities have been substantially completed for the Great Park Neighborhoods, significant future work is contemplated over the next few years for certain of The San Francisco Shipyard parcels, and such work could delay or impede future transfer of such parcels for development.\nAlthough most of our properties have been subjected to environmental assessments by independent environmental consultants or in the case of Great Park Neighborhoods and The San Francisco Shipyard, extensive environmental assessments by the U.S. government, these environmental assessments may not include or identify all potential environmental liabilities or risks associated with the properties. We cannot assure you that these or other environmental assessments identified all potential environmental liabilities, or that we will not incur material environmental liabilities in the future. We cannot predict with any certainty the magnitude of our future expenditures relating to environmental compliance or the long-range effect, if any, of environmental laws on our operations. Compliance with such laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and competitive position in the future.\nOur communities are all located in California, which makes us susceptible to risks in that state.\nOur communities, as well as the Treasure Island and Concord communities for which we provide development management services, are all located in California. We have no current plans to acquire any additional properties or operations outside of California and we expect, at least for a number of years, to be dependent upon our existing projects for all of our cash flow. As a result, we are susceptible to greater risks than if we owned a larger or more geographically diverse portfolio. California also continues to suffer from severe budgetary constraints, which may result in the layoff or furlough of government employees, and is regarded as more litigious and more highly regulated and taxed than many other states. Any adverse change in the economic, political, competitive or regulatory climate in California, or the counties and cities where our properties are located, could adversely affect our real estate development activities and have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, historically, California has been subject to natural disasters, including earthquakes, droughts, floods, wildfires and severe weather, and coastal locations may be particularly susceptible to climate stress events or adverse localized effects of climate change, such as sea-level rise and increased storm frequency or intensity. We therefore have greater exposure to the risks of natural disasters, which can lead to power shortages, shortages of labor and materials and delays in development. The occurrence of natural disasters may also negatively impact the demand for new homes in affected areas. If our insurance does not fully cover losses resulting from these events, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nDrought conditions in California may, from time to time, cause us to incur additional costs and delay or prevent construction within our communities, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn recent years, California has faced persistent drought conditions. In 2014, the Governor of California proclaimed a Drought State of Emergency warning that drought conditions may place drinking water supplies at risk in many California communities. In May 2016, the Governor of California issued an executive order that, among other things, directs the State Water Resources Control Board (the \u201cSWRCB\u201d) and the Department of Water Resources (the \u201cDWR\u201d) to require urban water suppliers to report monthly information regarding water use, conservation and enforcement on a permanent basis. In response to this executive order, the DWR and the SWRCB are required to engage in a public process and work with urban water suppliers, local governments and environmental groups to develop new water use efficiency targets as part of a long-term conservation framework for urban water agencies. These targets will go beyond the 20% reduction in per capita urban water use by 2020 that\nwas previously adopted in 2009, and will be customized to fit the unique conditions of each water supplier. These and other measures that are instituted to respond to drought conditions could cause us to incur additional costs to develop each community\u2019s infrastructure, as well as cause homebuilders and commercial builders to incur additional costs, which could reduce the price that they are willing to pay for our residential and commercial lots. Although the Governor of California rescinded the Drought State of Emergency in April 2017, if drought conditions were to return, there could be additional restrictions or moratoriums on building permits and access to utilities, such as water and sewer taps, which could delay or prevent our construction activities, as well as the construction of homes and commercial buildings, even when we have obtained water rights for our communities.\nSimultaneous development projects may divert management time and resources.\nSince all of our communities, and the Treasure Island and Concord communities for which we provide development management services, are being developed simultaneously, members of our senior management will be involved in planning and developing these projects, which may divert management resources from the construction, sale, lease or opening of any of these projects. Management\u2019s inability to devote sufficient time and attention to a project may delay the construction or opening of such project. This type of delay could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are highly dependent on homebuilders.\nWe are highly dependent on our relationships with homebuilders to purchase lots at our residential communities. Our business will be adversely affected if homebuilders do not view our residential communities as desirable locations for homebuilding operations. Also, some homebuilders may be unwilling or unable to close on previously committed land parcel purchases due to factors outside of our control. As a result, we may sell fewer land parcels and may have lower revenues from sales, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may from time to time be subject to litigation, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may from time to time be subject to various claims and routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. Among other things, we are, and are likely to continue to be, affected by litigation against governmental agencies related to environmental and similar approvals that we receive or seek to obtain. For example, in November 2015, the Supreme Court of California issued a ruling under CEQA and other state statutes, which required CDFW to reassess certain analyses and determinations related to greenhouse gas emissions and the protection of a certain fish species completed by CDFW in connection with approving the EIR for Newhall Ranch. In June 2017, CDFW certified the final additional environmental analysis and reapproved the Newhall Ranch project and related state permits. The ruling also required Los Angeles County to reassess its analyses and determinations related to greenhouse gas emissions in connection with the EIR and to reassess its previous related approvals. Although the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors certified the final additional environmental analysis, in combination with the 2011 EIR, and reapproved the Landmark Village and Mission Village development areas within Newhall Ranch along with related project approvals and permits in July 2017, the need to comply with the ruling forced us to delay, and increased the cost of, Newhall Ranch development. In addition, certain petitioners have filed objections to CDFW\u2019s June 2017 reapproval actions and have filed a new challenge to Los Angeles County\u2019s July 2017 reapproval actions.\nThese types of claims may result in potentially significant defense costs, settlements, fines or judgments against us, some of which may not be covered by insurance. Payment of any such costs, settlements, fines or judgments that are not insured or that exceed our insurance limits could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, certain litigation or the resolution of certain litigation may affect the availability or cost of some of our insurance coverage and adversely affect our results of operations, expose us to increased risks that would be uninsured or adversely impact our ability to attract officers and directors. Such litigation could adversely affect the length of time and the cost required to obtain the necessary governmental approvals. In addition, adverse decisions arising from any litigation could increase the cost and length of time to\nobtain ultimate approval of a project, could require us to abandon all or portions of a project and could adversely affect the design, scope, plans and profitability of a project, which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to increased costs of insurance or limitations on coverage.\nWe maintain comprehensive insurance coverage for general liability, property, workers\u2019 compensation and other risks on all of our properties and operations, including insurance covering certain environmental risks and liabilities. We believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these policies are adequate and appropriate. There are some risks of loss for which we may be unable to purchase insurance coverage. For example, losses associated with certain environmental risks or liabilities, floods, landslides, earthquakes and other weather-related or geologic events may not be insurable and other losses, such as those arising from terrorism, may not be economically insurable. In addition, there is no assurance that certain types of risks that are currently insurable will continue to be insurable on an economically feasible basis, and we may discontinue certain insurance coverage on some or all of our properties in the future if the cost of premiums for any of these policies in our judgment exceeds the value of the coverage discounted for the loss. If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs, we may have to incur uninsured costs to mitigate such losses or lose all or a portion of the capital invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property. We might also remain obligated for any financial obligations related to the property, even if the property is irreparably damaged. Future changes in the insurance industry\u2019s risk assessment approach and pricing structure could increase the cost of insuring our properties and operations or decrease the scope of insurance coverage, either of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nMoreover, we carry several different lines of insurance, placed with several large insurance carriers. If any one of these large insurance carriers were to become insolvent, we would be forced to replace the existing insurance coverage with another suitable carrier and any outstanding claims would be at risk for collection. In such an event, we cannot be certain that we would be able to replace the coverage at similar or otherwise favorable terms. Replacing insurance coverage at unfavorable rates and the potential of uncollectible claims due to carrier insolvency could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nTitle to our property may be impaired by title defects.\nWe cannot give any assurance that title to our properties will not be challenged or impugned, and cannot be certain that we have or will acquire valid title to our properties. Further, we cannot give any assurance that there are not any liens, encumbrances, mortgages, impositions, fines, violations, levies, superior title claims or other title defects or title issues (collectively, \u201ctitle defects\u201d) with respect to our properties. The lack of good, marketable fee title, or the existence of any existing title defects with respect to our properties, could materially and adversely affect our properties, including by resulting in: (1) chain of title issues (such as impediments to the potential sale, transfer, assignment or grant of any fee or leasehold interests in all or any portion of our properties); (2) financing issues (such as impediments to qualifying for a line of credit, mortgage or private equity financing); (3) development issues (such as impediments to qualifying for governmental licenses and permits or construction financing, delays in operations, or additional costs incurred in connection with any required corrective measures); (4) foreclosure, forfeiture and loss of fee title (such as resulting from a mortgage foreclosure, tax levy or rescission rights); (5) reduction of asset value; or (6) loss of revenue, capital or anticipated profits.\nAlthough the San Francisco Venture holds title insurance on the portions of The San Francisco Shipyard and Candlestick Point that it currently owns, and the Great Park Venture holds title insurance on Great Park Neighborhoods, we do not hold title insurance on Newhall Ranch. In any event, an owner\u2019s title insurance policy only provides insurance coverage as of the issuance date of such policy and does not protect against transfers or other title defects that impact the properties from and after the title policy issuance dates. Accordingly, for all of our properties, whether or not we hold title insurance, it is possible that there may be title defects for which we will have no title insurance coverage.\nIn addition, the title insurance policies we do hold may not insure for the current aggregate market value of our properties, and we do not intend to increase our title insurance coverage as the market value of our portfolio\nincreases. As a result, we may not have sufficient coverage against all losses that we may experience, including from adverse title claims.\nInflation may adversely affect us by increasing costs that we may not be able to recover.\nInflation can adversely affect us by increasing costs of materials and labor. In addition, inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates, which could have a negative impact on demand for homes and the cost of debt financing. In a highly inflationary environment, depending on industry and other economic conditions, we may be unable to raise prices enough to keep up with the rate of inflation, which would reduce our profit margins. Although the overall rate of inflation has been low for the last several years, we have been experiencing increases in the prices of labor and materials, especially at The San Francisco Shipyard and Candlestick Point, and there could be a significant increase in inflation in the future.\nSignificant competition could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe compete with other residential, retail and commercial property developers in the development of properties in the Northern and Southern California markets. We compete with a number of residential, retail and commercial developers, some with greater financial resources, in seeking resources for development and prospective purchasers. Competition from other real estate developers may adversely affect our ability to attract purchasers and sell or lease residential, retail and commercial properties, attract and retain experienced real estate development personnel or obtain construction materials and labor. These competitive conditions could make it difficult to sell properties at desirable prices and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to obtain suitable bonding for the development of our communities.\nWe provide performance bonds and letters of credit in the ordinary course of business to governmental authorities and others to ensure the completion of our projects or in support of obligations to build community improvements such as roads, sewers, water systems and other utilities. We may also be required to provide performance bonds or letters of credit to secure our performance under various escrow agreements, financial guarantees and other arrangements. If we are unable to obtain performance bonds or letters of credit when required or the cost or operational restrictions or conditions imposed by issuers to obtain them increases significantly, we may be significantly delayed in developing our communities or may incur significant additional expenses and, as a result, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nFluctuations in real estate values may require us to write down the carrying value of our real estate assets or real estate investments.\nOur industry is subject to significant variability and fluctuations in real estate values. The valuation of our real estate assets or real estate investments is inherently subjective and based on the individual characteristics of each asset. Factors such as competitive market supply and demand for inventory, changes in laws and regulations, political and economic conditions and interest and inflation rate fluctuations subject our valuations to uncertainty. Our valuations are made on the basis of assumptions that may not prove to reflect economic or demographic reality. If the real estate market deteriorates, we may reevaluate the assumptions used in our analysis. As a result, adverse market conditions may require us to write down the book value of certain real estate assets or real estate investments and some of those write-downs could be material. Any material write-downs of assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in global or regional climatic conditions and governmental actions in response to such changes may adversely affect us by restricting, or increasing the costs of, our planned development activities.\nThere is growing concern from many members of the scientific community and the general public that an increase in global average temperatures due to emissions of greenhouse gases and other human activities could cause significant changes in weather patterns and increase the frequency and severity of natural disasters. Government mandates, standards or regulations intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or ameliorate\nprojected climate change impacts could result in restrictions on land development in certain areas, higher costs resulting from green building codes and increased energy, transportation and raw material costs, or cause us to incur compliance expenses that we will be unable to fully recover, which could reduce our gross profit margins and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain of our environmental permits and approvals for our planned development at Newhall Ranch have been challenged by environmental groups on the basis of how government agencies measure anticipated greenhouse gas emissions from our future development. In November 2015, the Supreme Court of California issued a ruling under CEQA and other state statutes, which required CDFW to reassess certain analyses and determinations related to greenhouse gas emissions and the protection of a certain fish species completed by CDFW in connection with approving the EIR for Newhall Ranch. In June 2017, CDFW certified the final additional environmental analysis and reapproved the Newhall Ranch project and related state permits. The ruling also required Los Angeles County to reassess its analyses and determinations related to greenhouse gas emissions in connection with the EIR and to reassess its previous related approvals. Although the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors certified the final additional environmental analysis, in combination with the 2011 EIR, and reapproved the Landmark Village and Mission Village development areas within Newhall Ranch along with related project approvals and permits in July 2017, the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling resulted in the need to reassess certain elements of the project\u2019s potential impacts and to modify certain aspects (such as specific mitigation measures and project design features) related to the development plan for Newhall Ranch, which increased our costs. The ruling has resulted in delays in construction and could result in further delays beyond those currently anticipated, or in changes in the sequencing of our communities. Furthermore, certain petitioners have filed objections to CDFW\u2019s June 2017 reapproval and have filed a new challenge to Los Angeles County\u2019s July 2017 reapproval actions.\nOur property taxes could increase due to rate increases or reassessments or the imposition of new taxes or assessments, which may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe will be required to pay state and local real property taxes and assessments on our properties. The real property taxes and assessments on our properties may increase as property or special tax rates increase or if our properties are assessed or reassessed at a higher value by taxing authorities. If we are obligated to pay new taxes or if there are increases in the property taxes and assessments that we currently pay, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur trademarks, trade names and service marks may infringe other names and marks, or become diluted or invalidated.\nWe believe that our name and the names that we will be using to brand our communities, and their neighborhoods, are important to our business. However, we are aware of a number of other companies that use names that consist of or contain one or more of our names. As a result, there could be potential trade name, trademark or service mark infringement claims brought against us by the users of these names and marks, and such users may have rights that are senior to ours. If another company were to successfully challenge our right to use one or more of our names or marks, our business could be adversely impacted. In addition, to the extent third parties use similar names or marks, the value of our names and marks could be diminished.\nNegative publicity could adversely affect our reputation as well as our business, financial results and share price.\nNegative publicity related to our industry, company, brands, marketing, personnel, operations, business performance or customers may generate negative sentiment regarding our company, potentially affecting our share price and the performance of our business, regardless of its accuracy or inaccuracy. Our success in maintaining, extending and expanding our brand image and reputation depends on our ability to adapt and respond to such publicity in a rapidly changing environment. Negative sentiment resulting from adverse publicity or unfavorable public commentary could damage our brand image and reputation, reduce the demand for homes, homesites, and commercial and multi-family properties in our communities, or adversely affect our ability to acquire additional\nlandholdings and plan and develop new communities, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and share price.\nRisks Related to Our Organization and Structure\nWe depend on key personnel.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon the contributions of certain key personnel, including Mr. Haddad, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. These key personnel would be difficult to replace because of their experience in identifying, acquiring, developing, financing and managing real estate assets and their long-term relationships across, and strong reputation in, the real estate industry generally and for our communities specifically. If any of our key personnel were to cease employment with us, our results of operations could suffer. Our ability to retain our key personnel or to attract suitable replacements should any members of our management team leave is dependent on the competitive nature of the employment market. The loss of services from key personnel or a limitation in their availability could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. Further, such a loss could be negatively perceived in the capital markets.\nAs a holding company, we are entirely dependent upon the operations of the operating company and its ability to make distributions to provide cash flow to us or to pay taxes and other expenses.\nWe are a holding company and our only investment is our interest in the operating company. The operating company conducts all of our operations and owns all of our assets. As a result, our cash flow depends upon the cash flow of the operating company and its ability to provide funds to us in the form of distributions, loans or otherwise. The distributions that we receive from the operating company are based on our ownership interest in it, which was 58.6%, as of December 31, 2017. The operating company is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, is generally not subject to U.S. federal income tax. Instead, taxable income is allocated to the operating company\u2019s partners, including us. Accordingly, we incur income taxes on our proportionate share of any net taxable income of the operating company. Under the terms of the limited partnership agreement for the operating company, the operating company is obligated to make tax distributions to its partners, including us, subject to the restrictions described below. These tax distributions generally will be made on a pro rata basis. In addition to tax expenses, we also incur expenses related to our operations, including expenses under the tax receivable agreement (\u201cTRA\u201d), which we expect could be significant.\nThe ability of the operating company to make distributions in an amount sufficient to allow us to pay our taxes and operating expenses, including any payments under the TRA, is subject to the obligations of the operating company and its subsidiaries to their respective creditors. In addition, future financing arrangements may contain negative covenants limiting the ability of the operating company to make distributions to us. Furthermore, the ability of the operating company\u2019s subsidiaries and the Great Park Venture to pay distributions to the operating company may be limited by their obligations to their respective creditors and other investors. For example, the distribution rights of the holders of legacy interests in the Great Park Venture and the Class B partnership interests in Five Point Communities, LP will reduce the cash available for distribution to the operating company. Similarly, we may be limited in our ability to move capital among the operating company and its subsidiaries as a result of future financing arrangements and obligations to creditors.\nAs an equity investor in the operating company and, indirectly, in our other subsidiaries and the Great Park Venture and the Gateway Commercial Venture, our right (and, therefore, the rights of our shareholders) to receive assets upon the liquidation or reorganization of the operating company and its subsidiaries, or the Great Park Venture or the Gateway Commercial Venture, will be structurally subordinated to the claims of their creditors. Even if we are recognized as a creditor of the operating company, our claims may still be subordinated to any security interest in or other lien on its assets and any debt or other obligations. Therefore, in the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization, our consolidated assets will be available to satisfy the claims of our shareholders only after all of our liabilities and the liabilities of the operating company have been paid in full.\nRecent U.S. tax legislation may adversely affect our operations.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201cTax Act\u201d), which was signed into law on December 22, 2017, made significant changes to the taxation of U.S. business entities, including by, among other things, reducing the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax, restricting deductions allowed for net operating losses to 80% of current year taxable income, permitting net operating losses to be carried forward indefinitely and allowing immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of recovering the expense over time though depreciation. Although we expect the Tax Act to be beneficial to us overall, particularly by reducing our obligations under the tax receivable agreement, as described in a risk factor below, some aspects of the Act could potentially have a negative effect on our operations. For example, certain changes in the Tax Act applicable to individuals could have a negative effect on the housing market and, consequently, our operations. Among the possible changes that could negatively impact the perceived affordability of homeownership are new limitations on the ability to deduct (i) property taxes, (ii) mortgage interest and (iii) state and local income taxes. In addition, it is unclear how the Tax Act will affect state and local taxation, which often uses federal taxable income as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities. We continue to work with our tax advisors and auditors to determine the full impact that the Tax Act will have on us.\nSome of our directors are involved in other businesses including real estate activities and public or private investments and, therefore, may have competing or conflicting interests with us.\nCertain of our directors have and may in the future have interests in other real estate business activities, and may have control or influence over these activities or may serve as investment advisors, directors or officers of other real estate companies. These interests and activities, and any duties to third parties arising from such interests and activities, could divert the attention of such directors from our operations. Additionally, some of our directors are engaged in investment and other activities in which they may learn of real estate and other related opportunities. Our operating agreement and our code of business conduct and ethics expressly provide that our non-employee directors are not obligated to limit their interests or activities in their non-director capacities or to notify us of any opportunities that may arise in connection therewith, even if the opportunities are complementary to, or in competition with, our businesses. Accordingly, we have no expectation that we will be able to learn of or participate in such opportunities and it is possible that our directors, in their capacity as investment advisors, directors or officers of other real estate companies, may compete with us with respect to these opportunities. For example, three of our directors are senior officers of Lennar (a national homebuilder), one of our directors is a partner and portfolio manager of Castlelake (an investment firm), one of our directors is the lead independent director at William Lyon Homes (a regional homebuilder), one of our directors is a director at Tejon Ranch Company (a real estate development and agribusiness), and one of our directors is the chairman and chief executive officer of Shorenstein Properties, LLC (an owner and operator of office and multi-family properties), each of which may compete with us or make investments in entities that compete with us for development opportunities or otherwise.\nLennar is our largest equity owner and will be engaging in transactions with us and may compete with us.\nAs of December 31, 2017, Lennar owned Class A common shares and Class B common shares representing approximately 40% of our outstanding voting interests. Three of our directors are also senior officers of Lennar. Lennar is one of the nation\u2019s largest homebuilders and has in the past purchased properties from us. In the future, we expect that we will sell additional properties to Lennar. Transactions between Lennar and us must be approved by our conflicts committee. Transactions between the Great Park Venture and Lennar must be approved by a majority of the members of the Great Park Venture (excluding us). Nonetheless, Lennar\u2019s relationship with us could give it an advantage in bidding for properties that we own.\nLennar and an affiliate of Castlelake own the Lennar-CL Venture, which on May 2, 2016 acquired from us the Phase 1 Land and is the beneficial owner of the parcel for the parking structure at Candlestick Point (with record title to such parcel to be conveyed once a final subdivision map for such parcel is recorded). The Lennar-CL Venture also assumed all of the debt of the San Francisco Venture then outstanding, subject to our obligation to reimburse the Lennar-CL Venture for $102.7 million related to EB-5 loan proceeds that benefited us. We have agreements with the Lennar-CL Venture pursuant to which (1) the Lennar-CL Venture acquired or will acquire parcels within The San Francisco Shipyard and Candlestick Point that are entitled for up to 390 for-sale homesites, (2) the Lennar-CL\nVenture agreed to construct a parking structure, the film and arts center building and portions of the retail areas at Candlestick Point and we agreed to fund certain related design and construction costs, (3) we agreed to manage the Lennar-CL Venture\u2019s design and construction activities with respect to the parking structure, the film and arts center building and the multi-family homes and (4) the Lennar-CL Venture agreed to transfer to us entitlements for the right to construct at least 172 homesites and at least 70,000 square feet of retail space for use in the development of other portions of The San Francisco Shipyard and Candlestick Point. Also, under the terms of the joint venture agreement between the San Francisco Venture and Macerich and the associated development agreement, if we or the Lennar-CL Venture fail to achieve certain milestones, including our conveyance to the joint venture of the land for the mall on or prior to December 31, 2017, subject to certain extensions, Macerich will have the right to terminate the joint venture. At December 31, 2017, we did not convey the land for the mall to the joint venture because, at that time, we were continuing redesign efforts and evaluating certain milestones, including the timing of the conveyance to the Mall Venture of the land for the mall, with the members of the Mall Venture. However, in light of the rapidly evolving retail landscape, subsequent to December 31, 2017 we have been evaluating, together with the members of the Mall Venture, the viability of the mall at the site and have been exploring potential alternative configurations of the site. At this time, the development plan for the site and any related impact on the joint venture are uncertain. If the joint venture agreement and the development acquisition agreement are terminated, we would not be required to convey the land for the mall to the joint venture, but we would be required to repay a $65.1 million loan that Macerich made to us and to pay 50% of certain additional termination fees (the remainder would be paid by the Lennar-CL Venture).\nLennar may also compete with us. Lennar owns 50% of a joint venture that owns the Treasure Island community, located in San Francisco, which may compete with The San Francisco Shipyard and Candlestick Point. Lennar also has a right to acquire the first phase of the Concord community, located in the San Francisco Bay Area, which may compete with The San Francisco Shipyard and Candlestick Point. We provide development management services to Lennar with respect to the Treasure Island and Concord communities. Lennar may in the future bid for, and acquire for itself, properties that we may seek to acquire. Our operating agreement contains provisions that will permit Lennar to engage in such activities and transactions.\nLennar and Castlelake and their respective affiliates control approximately 57% of the voting power of our outstanding common shares and, as a result, are able to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring shareholder approval.\nHolders of our Class A common shares and our Class B common shares vote together as a single class on all matters (including the election of directors) submitted to a vote of shareholders, with a share of each class entitling the holder to one vote. As of December 31, 2017, Lennar and Castlelake and their respective affiliates beneficially owned, in the aggregate, Class A common shares and Class B common shares representing approximately 40% and 17%, respectively, of the voting power of our outstanding common shares. As a result, if these shareholders act together (which they have not agreed to do), they and their affiliates are able to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, which may have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control of us. These transactions may include those that other shareholders deem to be in their best interests and in which those other shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over their current prices.\nWe may have assumed unknown liabilities in connection with the formation transactions, which, if significant, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the formation transactions, we acquired equity interests in entities which have existing liabilities, some of which may be unknown or unquantifiable. In a contribution and sale agreement that we entered into in connection with the formation transactions, we received representations and warranties regarding the entities in which we acquired interests, but these representations and warranties did not survive the closing. If we discover new or additional liabilities, we may have no recourse for such liabilities. Any such liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe did not receive appraisals or fairness opinions in connection with the formation transactions.\nThe value of the equity interests and other assets acquired by us in the formation transactions, and the value of the securities and other consideration provided in exchange for such equity interests and other assets, were determined based on negotiation among the parties. We did not obtain any third-party appraisals of these equity interests and other assets, and the valuation implied by the consideration received for some of the assets could exceed their fair market value.\nWe will be required to pay certain investors for certain expected tax benefits.\nHolders of Class A units of the operating company may exchange their units for, at our option, either Class A common shares on a one-for-one basis (subject to adjustment in the event of share splits, distributions of shares, warrants or share rights, specified extraordinary distributions and similar events), or cash in an amount equal to the market value of such shares at the time of exchange. This exchange right is currently exercisable by all holders of outstanding Class A units of the operating company, except for 7,142,857 units purchased by Lennar on May 15, 2017, as to which such right is exercisable after May 15, 2018. We expect that basis adjustments resulting from these transactions, if they occur, will reduce the amount of income tax we would otherwise be required to pay in the future.\nMoreover, Section 704(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), and the U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, require that items of income, gain, loss and deduction that are attributable to the operating company\u2019s directly and indirectly held property, including property contributed to the operating company pursuant to the formation transactions, must be allocated among the partners of the operating company to take into account the difference between the fair market value and the adjusted tax basis of such assets on the date the formation transactions are consummated. As a result, the operating company will be required to make certain special allocations of its items of income, gain, loss and deduction that are attributable to such assets. These allocations, like the increases in tax basis described above, are likely to reduce the amount of income tax we would otherwise be required to pay.\nSimultaneously with the completion of the formation transactions, we entered into a TRA with the holders of Class A units of the operating company and the holders of Class A units of the San Francisco Venture. These investors include Mr. Haddad and entities affiliated with Lennar and Castlelake. The TRA provides for payments by us to such investors or their successors equal to 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in income tax we realize as a result of (1) increases in tax basis that are attributable to exchanges of Class A units of the operating company for our Class A common shares or cash or certain other taxable acquisitions of equity interests by the Company, (2) allocations that result from the application of the principles of Section 704(c) of the Code and (3) tax benefits related to imputed interest or guaranteed payments deemed to be paid or incurred by us as a result of the TRA. The TRA also makes certain assumptions intended to equalize the treatment of (A) holders who exchange their Class A units and provide us with tax benefits attributable to an increase in tax basis and (B) those who retain their Class A units and provide us with tax benefits attributable to special allocations of the operating company\u2019s items of income and gain pursuant to Section 704(c) of the Code.\nWe expect that during the expected term of the TRA, the payments that we make to the parties to the TRA could be substantial. The actual amount and timing of any payments under the TRA will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of exchanges of Class A units of the operating company, the price of our Class A common shares at the time of such exchanges, the extent to which such exchanges are taxable and our ability to use the potential tax benefits, which will depend on the amount and timing of our taxable income and the rate at which we pay income tax.\nDue to the various factors that will affect the amount and timing of the tax benefits we will receive, it is not possible to determine the exact amount of payments that will be made under the TRA. If the TRA had been terminated on December 31, 2017, we estimate that the termination payment would have been approximately $103.3 million, assuming no material changes to the relevant tax law, that the aggregate value of our properties is equal to the value implied by such per share price and that LIBOR is 2.11%. However, this is merely an estimate, and the actual payments made under the TRA in the event that it is terminated or otherwise could differ materially.\nIn certain circumstances, payments under the tax receivable agreement could exceed the actual tax benefits we realize.\nThe TRA provides that, upon a merger, asset sale or other form of business combination or certain other changes of control or if, at any time, we materially breach any of our obligations under the TRA or elect an early termination, our (or our successor\u2019s) obligations with respect to exchanged or acquired units (whether exchanged or acquired before or after such change of control, early termination or breach) will be based on certain assumptions, including that (1) we will have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the increased tax deductions and other benefits anticipated by the TRA, (2) all of our properties will be disposed of ratably over a 15 year period for fair market value and (3) any Class A units of the operating company that have not been exchanged will be deemed exchanged for the market value of our Class A common shares at the time of such change of control, early termination or breach. Consequently, it is possible in these circumstances that the actual cash tax savings realized by us may be significantly less than the corresponding TRA payments.\nWe will not be able to recover payments made under the tax receivable agreement if the related tax benefits are subsequently disallowed.\nThe Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) may challenge all or part of the tax basis increases or the special allocations upon which we calculate payments under the TRA, and a court might sustain such a challenge. Although we are not aware of any issue that would cause the IRS to challenge potential tax basis increases or other tax benefits covered under the TRA, if such basis increases or other benefits are subsequently disallowed (in whole or in part), the parties to the TRA will not be required to return any payments made in respect of such disallowed basis or other tax benefit. Consequently, it is possible in these circumstances that the actual tax savings realized by us may be significantly less than the corresponding TRA payments. However, because payments under the TRA in a year are based upon the amount by which 85% of the Company\u2019s cumulative net tax savings exceed the payments previously made under the TRA, disallowance of basis increases or other tax benefits would reduce payments under the TRA in years after the disallowance.\nThe obligations associated with being a public company require significant resources and management attention.\nAs a public company with our Class A common shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the \u201cNYSE\u201d), we are subject to laws, regulations and requirements, including the requirements of the Exchange Act, certain corporate governance provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), related regulations of the SEC and requirements of the NYSE. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports and proxy statements with respect to our business and financial condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we establish and maintain effective internal controls and procedures for financial reporting.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires our management and independent registered public accounting firm to attest annually on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. However, because we are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d), we will take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Once we are no longer an emerging growth company or if, prior to such date, we opt to no longer take advantage of the applicable exemption, we will be required to include an opinion from our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nThese reporting and other obligations place significant demands on our management, administrative, operational and accounting resources and may cause us to incur significant expenses. We may need to upgrade our systems or create new systems, implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures, create or outsource an internal audit function and hire additional legal, accounting and finance staff. If we are unable to accomplish these objectives in a timely and effective fashion, our ability to comply with the financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies could be impaired. Any failure to\noperate successfully as a public company could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to implement and maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately determine our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, our investors could lose confidence in our financial results, which could materially and adversely affect us.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. We may in the future discover areas of our internal controls that need improvement. Historically, the San Francisco Venture and the Management Company maintained systems and procedures separate from ours, which may make it more difficult for us to evaluate and integrate their systems and procedures on a reliable company-wide basis. Prior to the formation transactions, we were not required to report the results of the San Francisco Venture and the Management Company on a consolidated basis with us. However, following the consummation of the formation transactions, we are required to report their operations on a consolidated basis with ours. We are in the process of implementing a company-wide internal audit function and modifying our systems and procedures in a number of areas to enable us to report on a consolidated basis.\nWe cannot be certain that we will be successful in implementing or maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting and financial processes. Additionally, the existence of any material weakness or significant deficiency would require management to devote significant time and incur significant expense to remediate, and management may not be able to remediate in a timely manner any such material weakness or significant deficiency. The existence of any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could also result in errors in our financial statements that could require us to restate our financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, all of which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our Class A common shares less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified exemptions from various requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies in the United States. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nan exemption to include fewer than five years of selected financial data;\n\u2022\nan exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of the emerging growth company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting; and\n\u2022\nreduced disclosure about the emerging growth company\u2019s executive compensation arrangements.\nAs a result, the information that we provide shareholders in our filings with the SEC may be different than what is available with respect to many other public companies. If some investors find our Class A common shares less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions, there may be a less active trading market for our Class A common shares and our share price may be adversely affected. When we are no longer deemed to be an emerging growth company, we will not be entitled to the exemptions provided in the JOBS Act discussed above.\nCertain provisions in the operating company\u2019s limited partnership agreement may delay or prevent acquisitions of us.\nProvisions in the operating company\u2019s limited partnership agreement may delay, or make more difficult, an acquisition or change of control of us. These provisions could discourage third parties from making proposals involving an acquisition or change of control of us, although some holders of our Class A common shares might consider such proposals, if made, desirable. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na requirement that the partners consent to a merger, consolidation or other combination involving the company or any sale, lease, exchange or other transfer of all or substantially all of our assets or all or any portion of our interest in the operating company unless certain criteria are satisfied; and\n\u2022\nour ability, as sole managing general partner, to cause the operating company to issue units with terms that could delay, defer or prevent a merger or other change of control without the consent of the other partners.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our operating agreement or provisions of Delaware law could prevent or delay a change in control, even if a change of control would benefit our shareholders.\nProvisions of our operating agreement, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control, even if a change in control would benefit our shareholders. These provisions include the following:\n\u2022\nthere is no cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022\nour board of directors is classified so that only one-third of the directors are elected at each annual meeting of shareholders;\n\u2022\nour board of directors is authorized to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred shares to increase the number of outstanding shares without shareholder approval;\n\u2022\nshareholder action by written consent is not permitted; and\n\u2022\nthere are advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by shareholders at shareholder meetings.\nIn addition, our operating agreement provides that Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the \u201cDGCL\u201d) will be deemed to apply to us as if we were a Delaware corporation. Section 203 of the DGCL may affect the ability of an \u201cinterested shareholder\u201d to engage in certain business combinations, including mergers, consolidations or acquisitions of additional shares, for a period of three years following the time that the shareholder becomes an \u201cinterested shareholder.\u201d An \u201cinterested shareholder\u201d is defined to include persons owning directly or indirectly 15% or more of the outstanding voting shares of a company.\nWe do not control the Great Park Venture.\nThrough a wholly owned subsidiary of the operating company, we own a 37.5% percentage interest in the Great Park Venture and serve as its administrative member. However, the administrative member\u2019s authority is limited. Major decisions generally require approval by at least 75% of the votes held by the voting members of the Great Park Venture. We have two votes out of a total of five votes held by all voting members. Thus, any decision will require the additional approval of at least two of the other voting members. These approval rights could prevent actions at the Great Park Venture that would otherwise be in our best interests.\nWe do not control the Gateway Commercial Venture.\nThrough a wholly owned subsidiary of the operating company, we own a 75% interest in the Gateway Commercial Venture, the joint venture that acquired the Five Point Gateway Campus, and serve as its manager. However, the manager\u2019s authority is limited. Major decisions by the Gateway Commercial Venture generally require unanimous approval by an executive committee composed of two people designated by us and two people designated by another investor. Some decisions require approval by all of the members of the Gateway Commercial Venture. These approval rights could prevent actions at the Gateway Commercial Venture that would otherwise be in our best interests.\nThe joint venture with Macerich could be adversely affected by a failure of the Lennar-CL Venture to perform its obligations, by our reliance on Macerich\u2019s ability to make its required contributions, by disputes between us and Macerich or between the Lennar-CL Venture and Macerich or by the failure to meet key development milestones.\nThe San Francisco Venture formed a joint venture with Macerich to develop, build and operate an urban retail outlet mall at The San Francisco Shipyard and Candlestick Point and entered into an associated development agreement with the joint venture to develop certain infrastructure and a parking structure to support the mall. The San Francisco Venture transferred its interest in this joint venture to the Lennar-CL Venture, but is entitled to re-acquire the interest upon completion of the mall and parking structure. Also, under the development agreement, the Lennar-CL Venture agreed to construct a parking structure, the film and arts center building and the apartments above portions of the retail areas at the mall. Macerich is the managing member of the mall joint venture and, as such, controls day-to-day decisions relating to the joint venture and the mall, subject to the right of the Lennar-CL Venture to approve certain major decisions, such as changes to the development plan and budget for the mall and entry into a business combination with another entity. Pending the transfer of the joint venture interest to us, we have certain approval rights as well. Macerich could fail to fund its share of required capital contributions to the joint venture, make poor business decisions or take actions that are contrary to our objectives. Any disputes that arise with Macerich may result in litigation or alternative dispute resolution that could increase our expenses or distract our officers from focusing on our business. Also, under the terms of the joint venture agreement and the associated development and acquisition agreement with the joint venture, if we or the Lennar-CL Venture fail to achieve certain milestones, including our conveyance to the joint venture of the land for the mall on or prior to December 31, 2017, subject to certain extensions, Macerich will have the right to terminate the joint venture. At December 31, 2017, we did not convey the land for the mall to the joint venture because, at that time, we were continuing redesign efforts and evaluating certain milestones, including the timing of the conveyance to the Mall Venture of the land for the mall, with the members of the Mall Venture. However, in light of the rapidly evolving retail landscape, subsequent to December 31, 2017 we have been evaluating, together with the members of the Mall Venture, the viability of the mall at the site and have been exploring potential alternative configurations of the site. At this time, the development plan for the site and any related impact on the joint venture are uncertain. If the joint venture agreement and the development acquisition agreement are terminated, we would not be required to convey the land for the mall to the joint venture, but we would be required to repay a $65.1 million loan that Macerich made to us and to pay 50% of certain additional termination fees (the remainder would be paid by the Lennar-CL Venture).\nWe will need additional capital to execute our development plan, and we may be unable to raise additional capital on favorable terms.\nWe currently expect to have sufficient capital to fund the horizontal development of our communities in accordance with our development plan for several years. However, we will need additional capital to execute our development plan. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain new debt or equity financing on favorable terms, or at all, including as a result of volatility in the credit and capital markets, increases in interest rates or a decline in the value of our properties or portions thereof.\nIn addition, we currently expect to obtain a portion of our capital from forms of public financing, including Community Facilities District (\u201cCFD\u201d) bond issuances, tax increment financing, and state and federal grants, which depend, in part, on factors outside of our control. CFDs are established when local government agencies impose a special property tax on real estate located within a specific district for the purpose of financing public improvements, including streets, water, sewage, drainage, electricity, schools, parks and fire and police protection. Our ability to obtain funds from CFDs is dependent on the value of developed property in the specific district, the collection of general property taxes from property owners in the specific district, collection of special taxes from property owners in the specific district and market interest rates at the time the CFD bonds are issued. For tax increment financing, the amount of property tax that a specific district generates is set at a base amount and as property values increase, property tax growth above that base amount, net of property taxes retained by the municipal agencies, can be used to fund redevelopment projects within the district. Our ability to obtain funds from tax increment financing is dependent on the value of developed property in the specific district, the collection of general property taxes from property owners in the specific district, the time it takes the tax assessor to update the tax rolls and market interest rates at the time the tax increment bonds are issued.\nIf we need to obtain additional financing, and such financing is not available in a timely manner or on terms substantially similar to our existing financing, it could increase our cost of capital and we may experience delays or increases in costs, and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur substantial indebtedness may have a material adverse effect on our business, our financial condition and results of operations and our ability to secure additional financing in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we have approximately $570 million of total indebtedness, including $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.875% senior notes due 2025 (the \u201csenior notes\u201d). We also have $124 million available to be borrowed under our revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2017. Our indebtedness could subject us to many risks that, if realized, would adversely affect us, including the following:\n\u2022\nour cash flow from operations may be insufficient to make required payments of principal of and interest on the debt, and a failure to pay would likely result in acceleration of such debt and could result in cross accelerations or cross defaults on other debt;\n\u2022\nour debt may increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nto the extent that we use a portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments on our debt, it reduces our funds available for operations, development, capital expenditures and future investment opportunities or other purposes;\n\u2022\ndebt covenants may limit our ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, executing our development plan or other purposes;\n\u2022\nrestrictive debt covenants may limit our flexibility in operating our business, including limitations on our ability to make certain investments; incur additional indebtedness; create certain liens; incur obligations that restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make payments to us; consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; or enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nto the extent that our indebtedness bears interest at a variable rate (such as our revolving credit facility), we are exposed to the risk of increased interest rates;\n\u2022\ndebt covenants may limit our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to make distributions to us; and\n\u2022\nif any debt is refinanced, the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of the debt being refinanced.\nIn August 2017, the Gateway Commercial Venture, in which we own a 75% interest, entered into a debt facility with a total capacity of approximately $339 million to fund the purchase price for the Five Point Gateway Campus and the cost of future tenant improvements and certain capital expenditures at the Five Point Gateway Campus. The risks described above with respect to leverage are applicable to the Gateway Commercial Venture\u2019s borrowings. In addition, we have provided guaranties of the Gateway Commercial Venture\u2019s indebtedness that obligate us to (i) pay losses of the lender arising out of or in connection with fraud, intentional misrepresentation, gross negligence, willful misconduct, illegal acts and other customary \u201cbad act\u201d recourse exceptions by the Gateway Commercial Venture or its affiliates, and (ii) repay the indebtedness of the Gateway Commercial Venture upon the occurrence of certain bankruptcy or insolvency events, or other customary \u201cbad act\u201d recourse exceptions, involving the Gateway Commercial Venture or its affiliates.\nIf we do not have sufficient funds to repay our debt at maturity, it may be necessary to refinance the debt through additional debt or equity financings. If, at the time of any refinancing, prevailing interest rates or other factors result in a higher interest rate on such refinancing, increases in interest expense could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations. If we are unable to refinance our debt on acceptable terms, we may be forced to dispose of our assets on disadvantageous terms, postpone investments in the development of our properties or default on our debt. In addition, to the extent we cannot meet any future debt service obligations, we will risk losing some or all of our assets that are pledged to secure such obligations.\nWe may increase leverage in executing our development plan, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.\nWe may decide to increase leverage to execute our development plan. Our board of directors will consider a number of factors when evaluating our level of indebtedness and when making decisions regarding the incurrence of new indebtedness, including the estimated market value of our assets and the ability of particular assets, and our company as a whole, to generate cash flow to cover the expected debt service. Although the indenture relating to our senior notes limits our ability to incur additional indebtedness, our operating agreement does not limit the amount of debt we may incur, and our board of directors may change our target debt levels at any time without the approval of our shareholders. We may incur additional indebtedness from time to time in the future to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other purposes. If we do so, the risks related to our indebtedness could intensify.\nFuture debt financings, which would rank senior to our Class A common shares upon our bankruptcy or liquidation, and future offerings of equity securities that may be senior to our Class A common shares for the purposes of liquidating or other distributions, may adversely affect the market price of our Class A common shares.\nIn the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by obtaining additional debt financing (including by offering debt securities) or making additional offerings of equity securities. Upon bankruptcy or liquidation, holders of our debt and our preferred shares and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive distributions of our available assets prior to the holders of our Class A common shares. Additional equity offerings may dilute the holdings of our existing shareholders or reduce the market price of our Class A common shares, or both. Any convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our Class A common shares and may result in dilution to the holders of our Class A common shares. Holders of our Class A common shares are not entitled to preemptive rights or other protections against dilution. Our preferred shares, if issued, could have a preference on liquidating or other distributions that could limit our ability to make distributions to the holders of our Class A common shares. Our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control. As a result, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings, and holders of our Class A common shares bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our Class A common shares and diluting their ownership interest in our company.\nWe do not expect to be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations, including the senior notes, depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. Until such time as we can service our indebtedness with cash flow from operations, we intend to service our indebtedness, including interest on the senior notes and the revolving credit facility, from cash on hand.\nIf our cash flows, cash on hand and other capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional indebtedness or equity capital, or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to effect any such alternative measures, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. The credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility and the indenture relating to the senior notes restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise indebtedness or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due.\nOur inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments on our indebtedness, we will be in default and holders of the senior notes could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under the revolving credit facility could terminate their commitments to loan money, other indebtedness could be accelerated and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nIncreases in interest rates would increase our interest expense and reduce our profitability\nAs of December 31, 2017, on a consolidated basis, we had approximately $65.1 million of variable rate indebtedness outstanding. We estimate that an increase in 30 day LIBOR of 100 basis points with constant credit risk spreads would reduce our net income and the amount of net income attributable to our common security holders by approximately $0.7 million on an annual basis.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Shares\nAn active trading market for our Class A common shares may not be sustained and the price of our Class A common shares may be volatile.\nAlthough our Class A common shares are listed on the NYSE, an active trading market for our Class A common shares may not be sustained. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the following:\n\u2022\nthe likelihood that an active trading market for our Class A common shares will be sustained;\n\u2022\nthe liquidity of any such market;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our shareholders to sell their Class A common shares; or\n\u2022\nthe price that our shareholders may obtain for their Class A common shares.\nThe trading price of our Class A common shares may fluctuate widely as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. Historically, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of many companies. These broad market fluctuations could negatively affect the market price of our Class A common shares. A significant decline in our share price could result in substantial losses for individual shareholders and could lead to costly and disruptive securities litigation.\nSome of the factors that could negatively affect or result in fluctuations in the market price of our Class A common shares include:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in our quarterly results of operations;\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions;\n\u2022\nthe market\u2019s reaction to our reduced disclosure as a result of being an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act;\n\u2022\nthe operation and share price performance of other comparable companies;\n\u2022\nour ability to implement our development plan;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations, or new interpretations or applications of laws and regulations, that are applicable to us;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nactions by shareholders;\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or investment community regarding us or factors or events that may directly or indirectly affect us;\n\u2022\ngeneral or specific market, economic and political conditions, including supply and demand factors in our markets, an economic slowdown or dislocation in the global credit markets;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic trends and other external factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to such events;\n\u2022\nour operating performance, including changes in the status of our communities;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles;\n\u2022\npublication of research reports about us or the real estate industry;\n\u2022\nfuture equity issuances;\n\u2022\nour ability to raise capital on favorable terms;\n\u2022\na loss of any major funding source; and\n\u2022\nthe realization of any of the other risk factors presented in this report.\nSecurities markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the price of their common shares. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common shares. Any broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our Class A common shares.\nWe may issue additional Class A common shares in the future in lieu of incurring indebtedness, which may dilute existing shareholders, or we may issue securities that have rights and privileges that are more favorable than the rights and privileges accorded to holders of our Class A common shares.\nWe may issue additional securities, including Class A common shares, options, rights and warrants, for any purpose and for such consideration and on such terms and conditions as our board of directors may determine. Our board of directors will be able to determine the class, designations, preferences, rights, powers and duties of any additional securities, including any rights to share in our profits, losses and distributions, any rights to receive assets upon dissolution or liquidation and any redemption, conversion and exchange rights. Our board of directors may use such authority to issue additional securities exchangeable for our Class A common shares, such as the Class A units of the operating company, which would dilute existing holders of our Class A common shares, or to issue securities with rights and privileges that are more favorable than those of our Class A common shares. You will not have any right to consent to or otherwise approve the issuance of any such securities or the terms on which any such securities may be issued.\nSubstantial amounts of our Class A common shares could be sold in the near future, which could depress our share price and result in dilution of your shares.\nThe sale or issuance of a substantial number of Class A common shares or other equity-related securities in the public markets, or the perception that such sales could occur, could depress the market price of our Class A common shares and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had outstanding 62,314,850 Class A common shares. In addition, 81,487,873 Class A common shares are reserved for issuance upon exchange of Class A units of the operating company (including 37,479,205 Class A units of the operating company issuable upon exchange of Class A units of the San Francisco Venture) and conversion of our Class B common shares, and 5,697,244 Class A common shares are available for future issuance under the Incentive Award Plan (including 1,074,110 Class A common shares that may be issued in settlement of outstanding vested RSUs).\nFrom time to time, we may issue up to 81,487,873 Class A common shares upon conversion of Class B common shares or in exchange for outstanding Class A units of the operating company (including Class A units of the operating company issued in exchange for Class A units of the San Francisco Venture). Holders of Class A units\nof the operating company may exchange their units for, at our option, either Class A common shares on a one-for-one basis (subject to adjustment for share splits and similar events) or cash in an amount equal to the market value of such shares at the time of exchange. This exchange right is currently exercisable by all holders of outstanding Class A units of the operating company, except for 7,142,857 units purchased by Lennar on May 15, 2017, as to which such right is exercisable after May 15, 2018. Holders of Class A units of the San Francisco Venture may exchange their units for Class A units of the operating company on a one-for-one basis (with no holding period), subject to certain exceptions.\nPrior to the earlier of (1) 14 days after we become eligible to file a registration statement on Form S-3 and (2) 14 months after completing an initial public offering (IPO), we have agreed to register with the SEC the resale of Class A common shares held by certain of our existing shareholders and the Class A common shares that we may issue in exchange for Class A units of the operating company or Class A units of the San Francisco Venture. Following the effectiveness of the Form S-3 registration statement, we will be required to use our reasonable efforts to keep the Form S-3 registration statement (or a successor registration statement) effective until there are no longer any registrable securities other than Class A common shares that can be sold under Rule 144 without any limitation as to volume or manner of sale.\nWe cannot predict whether future issuances or sales of our Class A common shares or the availability of shares for resale in the open market will decrease the per share trading price of our Class A common shares. The per share trading price of our Class A common shares may decline significantly when the restrictions on resale by certain of our shareholders lapse or upon the registration of additional Class A common shares pursuant to registration rights granted to certain shareholders.\nWe do not intend to pay distributions on our Class A common shares for the foreseeable future.\nWe have no current plans to pay distributions on our Class A common shares in the foreseeable future. We intend to retain our earnings, if any, to use in our ongoing operations. Any decision to declare and pay distributions in the future will be made at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our financial condition, results of operations, cash requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. In addition, because we are a holding company and our only investment is our interest in the operating company, we will only be able to pay distributions from funds we receive from the operating company. Our board of directors has the authority to issue one or more series of preferred shares without action of our shareholders. The issuance of preferred shares could have the effect of limiting distributions on our Class A common shares. Accordingly, you may need to sell your Class A common shares to realize a return on your investment, and you may not be able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid for them.\nIf security or industry analysts do not publish, or cease publishing, research reports about us, our business or our market, or if such analysts make adverse recommendations regarding our Class A common shares, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common shares is influenced by whether industry or securities analysts publish research and reports about us, our business, our market or our competitors and, if any analysts do publish such reports, what they publish in those reports. We may not obtain analyst coverage in the future. Any analysts who do cover us may make adverse recommendations regarding our shares, adversely change their recommendations from time to time, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors. If any analyst who may cover us in the future were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, or if analysts fail to cover us or publish reports about us at all, we could lose, or never gain, visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.", "PERMNO": 16746, "SIC": 6552, "TIC": "FPH"}
