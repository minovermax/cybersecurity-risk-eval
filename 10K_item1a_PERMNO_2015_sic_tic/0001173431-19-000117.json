{"cik": "1173431", "company": "TD AMERITRADE HOLDING CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-11-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, future results of operations or stock price, and many of which we cannot control. Although the risks described below are those that we believe are the most significant, these are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not deem to be material also may materially affect our business, financial condition, future results of operations or stock price.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Business Operations\nEconomic, social and political conditions and other securities industry risks could adversely affect our business.\nSubstantially all of our revenues are derived from our securities brokerage business, which generates asset-based revenues and transaction-based revenues. Like other securities brokerage businesses, we are directly affected by economic, social and political conditions, broad trends in business and finance and changes in volume and price levels of securities transactions. Events in global financial markets in recent years resulted in substantial market volatility and increased client trading volume, but any sustained downturn in general economic conditions or U.S. equity markets could result in reduced client trading volume and order routing revenues. Severe market fluctuations or weak economic conditions could reduce our trading volume and net revenues and adversely affect our profitability.\nOur exposure to interest rate risk could adversely affect our profitability.\nAs a fundamental part of our securities brokerage business, we invest in interest-earning assets and are obligated on interest-bearing liabilities. In addition, we earn fees on our FDIC-insured deposit account arrangements with TD Bank USA, N.A., TD Bank N.A. and with other third-party financial institutions, which are subject to interest rate risk. Continued uncertainty resulting from U.S. fiscal and political matters have impacted and may continue to impact the U.S. and global economies. The direction and level of interest rates are important factors in our profitability.\nA falling interest rate environment generally results in our earning a smaller net interest spread. Conversely, a rising interest rate environment generally results in our earning a larger net interest spread.\nOur most prevalent form of interest rate risk is referred to as \"gap\" risk. This risk occurs when the interest rates we earn on assets change at a different frequency or amount than the interest rates we pay on liabilities. For example, in a low (but rising) interest rate environment, sharp increases in short-term interest rates could result in net interest spread compression if the yield paid on interest-bearing client balances were to increase faster than our earnings on interest-earning assets. If we are unable to effectively manage our interest rate risk, changes in interest rates could have adverse effects on our profitability.\nInability to meet the funding needs of our securities brokerage operations for any reason would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nMaintaining adequate liquidity is crucial to our securities brokerage operations, including key functions such as transaction settlement and margin lending. We are subject to cash deposit and collateral requirements with clearinghouses such as the DTCC and the OCC, which may fluctuate significantly from time to time based on the nature and size of our clients' trading activity. We satisfy our liquidity needs primarily from working capital and cash generated by client activity, as well as external financing. Our liquidity needs to support interest-earning assets are primarily met by client cash balances or financing created from our securities lending activities. A reduction of funds available from these sources may require us to seek other potentially more expensive forms of financing, such as borrowings on our revolving credit facilities.\nFactors which may adversely affect our liquidity positions include subsidiaries having temporary liquidity demands due to timing differences between brokerage transaction settlements and the availability of segregated cash balances, fluctuations in cash held in client accounts, a dramatic increase in our margin lending activities, increased regulatory capital requirements, changes in regulatory guidance or interpretations, other regulatory changes or a loss of market or client confidence resulting in unanticipated withdrawals of client funds.\nReduction in our liquidity could, in itself, reduce client confidence in us, which would result in the transfer of client assets and accounts, or could cause us to fail to satisfy our liquidity requirements. Also, while our regulated subsidiaries currently satisfy regulatory capital requirements, any failure to do so would curtail their operations and their ability to pay dividends to the parent company, which would reduce our liquidity and adversely affect our ability to repay debt and return capital to stockholders. We would then need to provide additional funding to such subsidiaries.\nOur liquidity could be constrained if we are unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all, due to a variety of unforeseen market disruptions. During periods of disruption in the credit and capital markets, borrowing costs may increase and potential sources of external financing may be reduced or even eliminated. In addition, a significant downgrade in our credit ratings could increase our borrowing costs and limit our access to the credit and capital markets. Inability to meet our funding needs on a timely basis would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur exposure to credit risk with clients and counterparties could result in losses.\nWe extend margin credit and leverage to clients, which are collateralized by client cash and securities. We also borrow and lend securities in connection with our broker-dealer business. A significant portion of our net revenues is derived from interest on margin loans. By permitting clients to purchase securities on margin and exercise leverage with options and futures positions, we are subject to risks inherent in extending credit, especially during periods of rapidly declining markets in which the value of the collateral held by us could fall below the amount of a client's indebtedness. In addition, in accordance with regulatory guidelines, we collateralize borrowings of securities by depositing cash or securities with lenders. Sharp changes in market values of substantial amounts of securities and the failure by parties to the borrowing transactions to honor their commitments could have adverse effects on our revenues and profitability. We also engage in financial transactions with counterparties, including securities sold under agreements to repurchase, that expose us to credit losses in the event counterparties cannot meet their obligations. We have policies and procedures designed to manage credit risk, but our policies and procedures may not be fully effective.\nWe need to introduce new products and services and update or enhance existing products and services to remain competitive.\nWe compete in a technology-intensive industry characterized by rapid innovation. Our future success depends in part on our ability to introduce new products and services or update or enhance our existing products and services. In addition, the adoption of new Internet, networking or telecommunications technologies or other technological changes could require us to incur substantial expenditures to update, enhance or adapt our services or infrastructure.\nThere are significant technical and financial costs and risks in the development of new or enhanced products and services, including the risk that we might be unable to effectively use new technologies, adapt our services to emerging industry standards or develop, introduce and market updated, enhanced or new products and services. An\ninability to develop new products and services, or to update or enhance existing offerings, could have adverse effects on our business and results of operations.\nOur clearing operations expose us to liability for errors in clearing functions.\nOur broker-dealer subsidiary, TDAC, provides clearing and execution services for our securities brokerage business. Clearing and execution services include the confirmation, receipt, settlement and delivery functions involved in securities transactions. Clearing brokers also assume direct responsibility for the possession or control of client securities and other assets and the clearing of client securities transactions. However, clearing brokers also must rely on third-party clearing organizations, such as the DTCC and the OCC, in settling client securities transactions. Clearing securities firms, such as TDAC, are subject to substantially more regulatory oversight and examination than introducing brokers that rely on others to perform clearing functions. Errors in performing clearing functions, including clerical and other errors related to the handling of funds and securities held by us on behalf of clients, could lead to regulatory fines and civil penalties as well as losses and liability in related legal proceedings brought by clients and others.\nA default by a large financial institution could adversely affect financial markets and our business.\nThe commercial soundness of many financial institutions are closely interrelated as a result of credit, trading, clearing and other relationships among the institutions. For example, increased centralization of trading activities through clearing houses and clearing agencies has occurred and may continue to occur in the future. This is driven by market forces and legal measures and may increase our concentration of risk with respect to these entities. As a result of this connectedness, concerns about, or a default or threatened default by, one institution can lead to significant market-wide liquidity and credit problems, defaults and losses by others. Sometimes referred to as \"systemic risk,\" this phenomenon may adversely affect financial intermediaries such as clearing houses, clearing agencies, exchanges, banks and securities firms with which we interact daily and could therefore negatively impact our business. Our membership agreements with the DTCC and OCC may require us to contribute capital to the clearing agencies if one or more other members default on their obligations.\nAggressive competition could reduce our market share, revenues and profits.\nThe market for electronic securities brokerage services is continually evolving and is intensely competitive. The securities brokerage industry has experienced significant consolidation, which may continue in the future, likely increasing competitive pressures in the industry. Consolidation could enable other firms to offer a broader range of products and services than we do, or offer them on better terms, such as higher interest rates paid on cash held in client accounts. We expect this intensely competitive environment to continue in the future. We face direct competition from numerous securities brokerage firms, including E*TRADE Financial Corporation, The Charles Schwab Corporation and Fidelity Investments. We also encounter competition from the broker-dealer affiliates of established full-commission brokerage firms, such as Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley, as well as from banks, mutual fund sponsors, online wealth management services (including so-called \"robo-advisors\") and other financial institutions and organizations, some of which provide online brokerage services. Some of our competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources, offer a wider range of services and financial products, and have greater name recognition and a more extensive client base than we do. Others offer a narrower range of products and services but benefit from a lower cost structure than we have. We believe that the general financial success of companies within the securities brokerage industry will continue to attract new competitors to the industry, such as software development companies, insurance companies, providers of online financial information and others. These companies may provide a more comprehensive suite of services than we do or offer services at lower prices. Increased competition could have adverse effects on our business such as reducing our market share, revenues and profits.\nOur ability to compete successfully in the securities brokerage industry depends on a number of factors, such as:\n\u2022\nmaintaining and expanding our market position;\n\u2022\nattracting and retaining customers;\n\u2022\nproviding easy to use and innovative financial products and services;\n\u2022\nour reputation and the market perception of our brand and overall value;\n\u2022\nmaintaining competitive pricing;\n\u2022\ncompeting in a concentrated competitive landscape;\n\u2022\noptimizing our costs of doing business;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our technology (including cybersecurity defenses), products and services;\n\u2022\ndeploying a secure and scalable technology and back office platform;\n\u2022\ncomplying with the differences in regulatory oversight regimes;\n\u2022\nattracting new employees and retaining our existing employees; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and industry trends, including customer demand for financial products and services.\nOur competitive position within the industry could be adversely affected if we were unable to address these factors adequately.\nInformation system failures, delays and capacity constraints could harm our business.\nWe receive and process trade orders through a variety of electronic channels, including the Internet, mobile trading applications and our interactive voice response system. These methods of trading are heavily dependent on the integrity of the electronic systems supporting them. Our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, power loss, human error, execution error, errors in models (such as those used for asset management, risk management, stress testing and compliance), employee misconduct, unauthorized trading, external fraud, cyber attacks, terrorist attacks, capacity constraints, software flaws, events impacting key vendors, phishing or other attempted unauthorized access, computer viruses, distributed denial of service (\"DDOS\") attacks, spurious spam attacks, ransomware, intentional acts of vandalism and similar events. It could take several hours or more to restore full functionality following any of these events. Extraordinary trading volumes could cause our computer systems to operate at an unacceptably slow speed or even fail. Extraordinary Internet traffic caused by DDOS, spam attacks or extreme market volatility could cause our website or other trading applications to be unavailable or slow to respond.\nWe may not be able to project accurately the rate, timing or cost of any increases in our business or to expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate any increases in a timely manner. While we have made significant investments in the reliability and scalability of our systems and added hardware and services to address extraordinary Internet traffic, there can be no assurance that our systems will be sufficient to handle extraordinary circumstances. Systems failures and delays could occur and could cause, among other things, unanticipated disruptions in service to our clients, substantial losses to our clients, slower system response time resulting in transactions not being processed as quickly as our clients desire, decreased levels of client service and client satisfaction and harm to our reputation. Slowness or unavailability may not impact all trading channels evenly, and some trading channels may be impacted while others are not. Social media and media reports may conflate one channel being unavailable with all channels being unavailable. Should our operations be disrupted, we might need to make significant unbudgeted investments to upgrade, repair or replace our technology infrastructure and might not be able to make such investments on a timely basis. As a result of these technological, operational and financial issues, we could suffer unexpected losses, reputational damage and/or regulatory action.\nWe are also dependent on the integrity and performance of securities exchanges, clearing houses and other intermediaries to which client orders are routed for execution and settlement. Systems failures and constraints and transaction errors at such intermediaries could result in delays and erroneous or unanticipated execution prices, cause substantial losses for us and our clients and subject us to claims from our clients for damages.\nFurther, a cybersecurity intrusion could occur and persist for an extended period of time without detection, and any investigation of a cybersecurity intrusion could require a substantial amount of time. During all this time we might not know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it, and errors or omissions could be repeated or compounded before being discovered and remediated, all of which could aggravate the costs and consequences of the intrusion. A cybersecurity intrusion could result in misappropriation of our information or client information, destruction or obfuscation of information, inability to access or use information or impairment of the integrity of information, all of which could result in us being unable to perform our obligations to our clients, which could result in regulatory action and risk of claims for damages from clients.\nAs our business model relies heavily on our clients' use of their own personal computers, mobile devices and the Internet, our business and reputation could be harmed by security breaches of our clients and third parties. Computer viruses and other attacks on our clients' personal computer systems, home networks and mobile devices or against the third-party networks and systems of Internet and mobile service providers could create losses for our clients even without any breach in the security of our systems and could thereby harm our business and our reputation. As part of our asset protection guarantee, we may reimburse our clients for losses in their accounts caused by a breach of security of our clients' own computers (through no fault of the client). Such reimbursements may not be covered by applicable insurance and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The occurrence of any of these events could have adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. There is no guarantee that we will be able to maintain, expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to meet future requirements and mitigate future risks on a timely basis or that we will be able to retain all of the skilled information technology employees that we need.\nFailure to protect client data or prevent breaches of our information systems could expose us to liability or reputational damage.\nWe are dependent on information technology networks and systems to securely process, transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations and with our clients and vendors. As the breadth and complexity of this infrastructure continue to grow, the potential risk of security breaches and cyber attacks increases. Developing and enhancing new products and services, which is necessary for us to remain competitive, may involve the use or creation of new technologies, exposes us to cybersecurity and privacy risks that cannot be completely anticipated and increases the risk of security breaches and cyber attacks. As a financial services company, we are continuously subject to cyber attacks, DDOS and ransomware attacks, malicious code and computer viruses by activists, hackers, organized crime, foreign state actors and other third parties. Such breaches could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our systems, account takeovers and unauthorized gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss, total destruction and disclosure of data and confidential information of ours, our clients, our employees or other third parties, or otherwise materially disrupt our or our clients' or other third parties' network access or business operations. In addition, vulnerabilities of our external service providers and other third parties could pose security risks to client information. The secure transmission of confidential information over public networks is also a critical element of our operations. Despite our efforts to assure the integrity of our systems, we may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches, especially because the techniques that are used change frequently or are not recognized until launched and because security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources. Data security breaches may also result from non-technical means (such as employee misconduct).\nWe, along with the financial services industry in general, have experienced losses related to clients' login and password information being compromised, generally caused by attacks capturing credentials directly from clients themselves, through phishing attacks, clients' use of non-secure public computers or vulnerabilities of clients' private computers and mobile devices. In 2007, we discovered and eliminated unauthorized code from our computer systems that had allowed an unauthorized third party to retrieve client email addresses, names, addresses and phone numbers from an internal database. Following the incident, we incurred significant remediation costs. In addition, in 2013, Scottrade Financial Services, Inc., which we acquired in September 2017, experienced a database breach. We are aware of subsequent attempts by other attackers to penetrate our systems using similar techniques and similar attacks against other financial institutions. Although we have taken steps to reduce the risk of such threats, our risk and exposure to a cyber attack or related breach remains heightened due to the evolving nature of these threats, our plans to continue to implement mobile access solutions to serve our clients, our routine transmission of sensitive information to third parties, the current global economic and political environment, external extremist parties and other developing factors. If a cyber attack or similar breach were to occur, we could suffer damage to our reputation and incur significant remediation costs and losses.\nIn providing services to clients, we manage, utilize and store sensitive and confidential client data, including personal data. As a result, we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information, such as U.S. federal and state laws and foreign regulations governing the protection of personally identifiable information. These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number, change frequently and sometimes conflict. If any person, including any of our employees, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client data, or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we could be subject to significant monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines and/or criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions.\nUnauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client data, whether through systems failure, employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients. Similarly, unauthorized access to or through our information systems, whether by our employees or third parties, including a cyber attack by third parties who may deploy viruses, worms or other malicious software programs, could result in negative publicity, significant remediation costs, legal liability, regulatory fines, financial responsibility under our asset protection guarantee to reimburse clients for losses in their accounts resulting from unauthorized activity in their accounts (through no fault of the client) and damage to our reputation and could have adverse effects on our results of operations.\nAny actual or perceived breach of the security of our technology, or media reports of perceived security vulnerabilities of our systems or the systems of our third-party service providers, could damage our reputation, expose us to the risk of litigation and liability, disrupt our operations, increase our costs with respect to investigations and remediations, reduce our revenues as a result of the theft of intellectual property, and otherwise adversely affect our business. Further, any actual or perceived security breach or cyber attack directed at other financial institutions or financial services companies, whether or not we are impacted, could lead to a general loss of customer confidence in the use of technology to conduct financial transactions, which could negatively impact us. The occurrence of any of these events could have adverse effects on our business and results of operations.\nIf any person, including any of our employees, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client or employee data, or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we could be subject to significant monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines and criminal prosecutions.\nAlthough we maintain insurance coverage that we believe is reasonable, prudent and adequate for the purpose of our business, it might be insufficient in type or amount to protect us against all losses and costs stemming from security breaches, cyber attacks and other types of unlawful activity or any resulting disruptions from such events.\nWe also face risk related to external fraud involving the misappropriation and use of clients' user names, passwords or other personal information to gain access to their accounts. This could occur from the compromise of clients' personal electronic devices or as a result of a data security breach at an unrelated company where clients' personal information is taken and then made available to fraudsters. This risk has grown in recent years due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime and other external parties, including foreign state-sponsored parties. Losses in client accounts reimbursed under our asset protection guarantee against unauthorized account activity (through no fault of the client) could have adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur investment advisory services subject us to additional risks that could result in liability for client losses, fines, penalties and other adverse effects.\nWe provide investment advisory services to investors through our SEC-registered investment advisors, TD Ameritrade, Inc., TD Ameritrade Investment Management, LLC and TradeWise Advisors, Inc. (\"TradeWise\"). TD Ameritrade, Inc. offers AdvisorDirect,\u00ae a service that refers a client to an independent RIA on the TD Ameritrade institutional platform. TD Ameritrade Investment Management, LLC manages an investment portfolio, through its Essential, Selective or Personalized Portfolios services, based on an investor's objectives, time horizon and risk tolerance. TradeWise provides an option advisory subscription service for self-directed investors. The risks associated with these investment advisory activities include those arising from possible conflicts of interest, unsuitable investment recommendations, inadequate due diligence, inadequate disclosure and fraud. Realization of these risks could lead to liability for client losses, regulatory fines, civil penalties and harm to our reputation and business.\nMergers and acquisitions in which we might engage involve risks that could adversely affect our business.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we regularly consider, and from time to time engage in, discussions and negotiations regarding transactions, such as mergers, acquisitions and other business combinations within our industry. The purchase price for possible acquisitions of businesses and technologies might be paid in cash, through the issuance of common stock or other securities, borrowings or a combination of these methods.\nBusiness combinations entail numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the integration of acquired operations, services and products, which can impact retention of client accounts;\n\u2022\nfailure to achieve expected synergies;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management's attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\nassumption of unknown material liabilities of acquired companies, which could become material or subject us to litigation or regulatory risks;\n\u2022\namortization of acquired intangible assets, which could reduce future reported earnings; and\n\u2022\npotential loss of clients or key employees.\nWe cannot be certain that we will be able to identify, consummate and successfully integrate business combinations, and no assurance can be given with respect to the timing, likelihood or business effect of any possible transaction. For example, we could begin negotiations that we subsequently decide to suspend or terminate for a variety of reasons. Also, business combinations are typically subject to closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and the absence of a material adverse change. Therefore, if and when we enter into a business combination agreement, there can be no guarantee that the transaction will close when expected, or at all. If a material transaction does not close, our stock price could decline.\nNevertheless, opportunities arise from time to time that we choose to evaluate. Any transactions that we pursue and consummate would involve these risks and uncertainties, as well as others. The risks of a business combination could result in the failure of the anticipated benefits of that particular combination to be realized, which in turn could have adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nAt our risk, we rely on external service providers to perform certain key functions.\nWe rely on a number of external service providers for certain key technology, processing, service and support functions. These include the services of other broker-dealers, market makers, exchanges and clearinghouses to execute and settle client orders. We contract with external providers for futures and foreign exchange clearing. External content providers provide us with financial information, market news, charts, option and stock quotes, research reports and other fundamental data that we offer to clients. These service providers face technological, operational and security risks of their own. A significant failure by any of them, such as improper use or disclosure of our confidential client, employee or Company information, could interrupt our business, subject us to losses and harm our reputation. Also, our external service providers may rely on others, including subcontractors or cloud computing service providers, to provide services to us, subject to similar risks.\nWe evaluate external service providers to verify that they can support the stability of our operations and systems. There is no assurance, however, that we will not experience business interruption or loss due to an act or omission of such a service provider. Any significant failures or security breaches by or of our external service providers or their subcontractors, including any actual or perceived cyber attacks, security breaches, fraud, phishing attacks, acts of vandalism, information security breaches and computer viruses that could result in unauthorized access, misuse, loss or destruction of data, interruption in service or other similar events, could interrupt our business, cause us to incur losses, subject us to fines or litigation and harm our reputation. An interruption in or the cessation of service by any external service provider and our inability to make alternative arrangements in a timely manner could have a material impact on our ability to offer products and services, cause us to incur losses, and could lead to a general loss of customer confidence in our security measures and technology infrastructure.\nThere is no assurance that our external service providers or their subcontractors will be able to continue to provide these services to meet our current needs in an efficient, cost-effective manner or that they will be able to adequately expand their services to meet our needs in the future. Some external service providers have assets located outside the United States that are integral to their service to us. Their ability to continue providing these services is subject to the risks of unfavorable political, economic, legal and other developments such as social or political instability, changes in government policies or changes in laws and regulations.\nAn interruption in or the cessation of service by an external service provider as a result of systems failure, capacity constraint, financial constraint or other financial problem, unanticipated trading market closure or for any other\nreason, coupled with our possible inability to make alternative arrangements in a smooth and timely manner, could have adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In this connection, we could incur significant additional costs to implement enhanced protective measures and technology, to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures or to make required notifications. Switching to an alternative service provider might require a transition period and result in less efficiency.\nEmployee misconduct, which can be difficult to detect and deter, could harm our reputation and subject us to significant legal liability.\nThere have been numerous highly-publicized cases of fraud and other misconduct by financial services industry employees. Our employees could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business. The precautions that we take to detect and deter employee misconduct might not be effective. If one or more of our employees were to improperly access, use or disclose confidential information or engage in other misconduct, we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and suffer serious harm to our financial condition, reputation, client relationships and prospects of attracting additional clients.\nOur risk management practices may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk.\nOur management team is responsible for managing risk, using risk management processes, policies and procedures to identify, measure and manage risks. The risk committee of our board of directors assists the board in its oversight responsibilities relating to the identification, monitoring and assessment of the key risks of the Company, including the significant policies, procedures and practices employed in risk management. Our risk management methods, however, may not identify future risk exposures and may not be completely effective in mitigating our key risks. Furthermore, our risk management methods may not properly identify and mitigate the aggregation of risks across our organization or the interdependency of our risk mitigation efforts. In addition, some of our risk management methods are based on assumptions that could prove to be inaccurate. Failure to manage risk effectively could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe expected phase-out of LIBOR could negatively impact our net interest income and could have other adverse effects.\nCertain of the indentures and credit agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness for borrowed money reference LIBOR as the benchmark rate to determine the applicable interest rate or payment amount. We also use LIBOR in some of our financial models. If LIBOR is discontinued after 2021 as expected, there will be uncertainty or differences in the calculation of the applicable interest rate or payment amount, depending on the terms of the governing instruments, and work will be required to transition to using the new benchmark rates and to implement necessary changes to our financial models. This could result in different financial performance for previously booked transactions and may impact our existing transaction data, products, systems, operations and pricing processes. The calculation of interest rates under the replacement benchmarks could also impact our net interest income. In addition, LIBOR may perform differently during the phase-out period than in the past which could result in different interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness.\nRisk Factors Relating to the Regulatory and Legislative Environment\nNew and changing laws, rules, regulations and guidance may have continuing negative impacts on our business and financial results.\nNew laws, rules, regulations and guidance, or changes in the interpretation and enforcement of existing federal, state, foreign and self-regulatory organization (\"SRO\") laws, rules, regulations and guidance may directly affect our business and the profitability of the Company or the operation of specific business lines. In addition, new and changing laws, rules, regulation and guidance could result in limitations on the lines of business we conduct, modifications to our business practices, more stringent capital and liquidity requirements or other costs and could limit our ability to return capital to stockholders.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \"Dodd-Frank Act\"), enacted in 2010, required many federal agencies to adopt new rules and regulations applicable to the financial services industry and called for many studies regarding various industry practices. In particular, the Dodd-Frank Act gave the SEC discretion to adopt rules regarding standards of conduct for broker-dealers providing investment advice to retail customers.\nThe U.S. Department of Labor (\"DOL\") enacted regulations changing the definition of who is an investment advice fiduciary under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and how such advice can be provided to account holders in retirement accounts such as 401(k) plans and Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs). The DOL's final rule defining the term \"fiduciary\" and exemptions related to it in the context of ERISA and retirement accounts was vacated in June 2018 by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The SEC and several states then proposed heightened standard of conduct regulations, with the SEC adopting such regulations in June 2019.\nThe rules and interpretations adopted by the SEC in June 2019 include Regulation Best Interest and the new Form CRS Relationship Summary, which are intended to enhance the quality and transparency of retail investors' relationships with broker-dealers and investment advisers. Regulation Best Interest enhances the broker-dealer standard of conduct beyond existing suitability obligations, requiring compliance with disclosure, care, conflict of interest and compliance obligations. The regulation requires that a broker-dealer or natural person who is an associated person of the broker-dealer shall act in the best interest of the retail customer at the time it makes a recommendation of any securities transaction or investment strategy involving securities, prioritizing the interests of the customer above any interests of the broker-dealer or its associated persons. Among other things, this requires the broker-dealer to mitigate conflicts of interest arising from financial incentives in selling securities products. The compliance date for Regulation Best Interest and Form CRS is June 30, 2020.\nIt is unclear whether Regulation Best Interest will have any preemptive effect on similar existing or forthcoming state-level standard of conduct regulations. These regulations may have a material impact on the provision of investment services to retail investors, including imposing additional compliance, reporting and operational requirements, which could negatively affect our business. These regulations also continue to subject us to an increased risk of class actions and other litigation and regulatory risks. It is not certain what the scope of future rulemaking or interpretive guidance from the SEC and other regulatory agencies may be, how the courts and regulators might interpret these rules and what impact this will have on our compliance costs, business, operations and profitability.\nThe SEC has adopted National Market System (NMS) Rule 610T to conduct a transaction fee pilot (the \u201cPilot\u201d) designed to generate data that will help the SEC analyze the effects of exchange transaction fee and rebate pricing models on order routing behavior, execution quality, and market quality generally. Data from the Pilot will be used to facilitate an empirical evaluation of whether the exchange transaction-based fee and rebate structure is operating effectively to further statutory goals and whether there is a need for any potential regulatory action in this area. In March 2019, the SEC issued an order issuing a stay on parts of Rule 610T and the Pilot pending a court decision regarding certain petitions filed by the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and Cboe Global Markets, Inc. for review and further order of the SEC. Any changes arising from the Pilot, as well as other potential regulatory actions, may impact certain of our remuneration arrangements with respect to payment for order flow and rebate structure and may impose additional technological, operational and compliance costs on us and creates uncertainty with regard to their effects.\nOur profitability could also be affected by new or modified laws that impact the business and financial communities generally, including changes to the laws governing banking, the securities market, fiduciary duties, conflicts of interest, taxation, electronic commerce, client privacy and security of client data. As existing laws are modified and new laws are implemented, we may incur significant additional costs and have to expend a significant amount of time to develop and integrate appropriate systems and procedures to ensure initial and continuing compliance with such laws. These additional costs could have adverse effects on our profitability.\nFailure to comply with net capital requirements could adversely affect our business.\nThe SEC, FINRA, CFTC, NFA and various other regulatory agencies have stringent rules with respect to the maintenance of specific levels of net capital by securities broker-dealers, FCMs and FDMs. Net capital is a measure of a broker-dealer's, an FCM's or an FDM's readily available liquid assets, reduced by its total liabilities other than approved subordinated debt. Our broker-dealer and FCM/FDM subsidiaries are required to comply with net capital requirements. If we fail to maintain the required net capital, the SEC or the CFTC could suspend or revoke our registration, and FINRA or the NFA could expel us from membership, which could ultimately lead to our liquidation, or they could impose censures, fines or other sanctions. If the net capital rules are changed or expanded, or if there is an unusually large charge against net capital, then our operations that require capital could be limited, and we\nmay not be able to pay dividends or make stock repurchases. A large operating loss or charge against net capital could have adverse effects on our ability to maintain or expand our business.\nExtensive regulation and regulatory uncertainties could harm our business.\nThe securities industry is subject to extensive regulation by federal, state, international government and self-regulatory agencies, and financial services companies are subject to regulations covering all aspects of the securities business. The costs and uncertainties related to complying with these regulations continue to increase. Regulations are intended to ensure the integrity of financial markets, appropriate capitalization of broker-dealers, FCMs and FDMs and the protection of clients and their assets. These regulations often serve to limit our business activities through capital, client protection and market conduct requirements, as well as restrictions on the activities that we are authorized to conduct. Federal, state and foreign regulators, and SROs, among other things, can censure, fine, issue cease-and-desist orders to, suspend or expel a regulated entity or any of its officers or employees. Despite our efforts to comply with applicable legal requirements, there are a number of risks, including in areas where applicable laws or regulations may be unclear or where regulators could revise their previous guidance, and we could fail to establish and enforce procedures to comply with applicable legal requirements and regulations, which could have adverse effects on our business.\nPast turmoil in the financial markets has contributed to changes in laws and regulations, heightened scrutiny of the conduct of financial services firms and increasing penalties for violations of applicable laws and regulations. We may be adversely affected by new laws or regulations, changes in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations or more rigorous enforcement. The new laws and regulations may be complex, and we may not have the benefit of regulatory or federal interpretations to guide us in compliance. Changes in laws and regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations also can have adverse effects on our methods and costs of doing business. We also may be adversely affected by other regulatory changes related to suitability of financial products, supervision, sales practices, application of fiduciary standards, best execution and market structure, which could limit the Company's business. Because TD, among other things, owns more than 25% of our common stock, we are considered a non-bank subsidiary of TD under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the \"BHC Act\"). As a result, under the BHC Act, we are subject to the supervision and regulation of the Federal Reserve. These banking regulations limit the activities and the types of businesses that we may conduct and the types of companies we may acquire, and under these regulations the Federal Reserve could impose significant limitations on our current business and operations. TD is currently regulated as a \"financial holding company\" under the BHC Act, which allows TD and us to engage in a much broader set of activities than would otherwise be permitted under the BHC Act. Any failure of TD to maintain its status as a financial holding company could result in substantial limitations on certain of our activities.\nFinancial services firms are subject to numerous actual or perceived conflicts of interest, as to which regulators and SROs have increased their scrutiny. Addressing conflicts of interest is a complex and difficult undertaking. Our business and reputation could be harmed if we were to fail, or appear to fail, to address conflicts appropriately.\nIn addition, we use the Internet as a major distribution channel to provide services to our clients. A number of regulatory agencies have adopted regulations regarding client privacy, system security and safeguarding practices and the use of client information by service providers. Additional laws and regulations relating to the Internet and safeguarding practices could be adopted in the future, including laws related to access, identity theft and regulations regarding the pricing, taxation, content and quality of products and services delivered over the Internet. Complying with these laws and regulations may be expensive and time-consuming and could limit our ability to use the Internet as a distribution channel, which would have adverse effects on our business and profitability.\nWhile we maintain systems and procedures designed to ensure that we comply with applicable laws and regulations, violations could still occur. In addition, some legal and regulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for non-compliance even though the non-compliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even though systems and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations were in place at the time. There may be other negative consequences resulting from a finding of non-compliance, including restrictions on certain activities. Such a finding may also damage our reputation and our relationships with regulators and could restrict the ability of institutional investment managers to invest in our securities.\nWe are subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings and may not always succeed in defending against them.\nAs a participant in the financial services industry, we face substantial litigation and regulatory risks. We are subject to arbitration claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of our business, as well as class actions and other significant litigation. We also are the subject of inquiries, investigations and proceedings by regulators, other government agencies and SROs. Even if and when we succeed in defending against these actions, the defense may be costly to us.\nThe SEC, FINRA and other SROs and state securities commissions, among other things, can censure, fine, issue cease-and-desist orders or suspend or expel a broker-dealer or any of its officers or employees. Similarly, state attorneys general can bring legal actions on behalf of the citizens of their states to assure compliance with state laws. Regulatory agencies in countries outside of the U.S. have similar authority. The ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is dependent in part on the establishment and maintenance of a reasonable compliance function. Failure to establish and enforce reasonable compliance procedures, even if unintentional, can subject us to significant losses or disciplinary or other actions.\nActions brought against us may result in settlements, awards, injunctions, fines, penalties and other results adverse to us. Predicting the outcome of such matters is inherently difficult, particularly where claims are brought on behalf of various classes of claimants or by a large number of claimants, when claimants seek substantial or unspecified damages or when investigations or legal proceedings are at an early stage. A substantial judgment, settlement, fine or penalty could be material to our operating results or cash flows for a particular period, depending on our results for that period, or could cause us significant reputational harm, which could harm our business prospects. In market downturns, the volume of legal claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial services companies have historically increased.\nWe also are subject to litigation claims from third parties alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights. Such litigation can require the expenditure of significant resources, regardless of whether the claims have merit. If we were found to have infringed a third-party patent or other intellectual property right, then we could incur substantial liability and in some circumstances could be enjoined from using the relevant technology or providing related products and services, which could have adverse effects on our business and results of operations.\nRisk Factors Relating to Owning Our Stock\nTD exercises significant influence over us.\nAs of September 30, 2019, TD owned approximately 43% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, TD generally has the ability to significantly influence the outcome of any matter submitted to a vote of our stockholders and, as a result of its significant share ownership in TD Ameritrade, TD may have the power, subject to applicable law, to significantly influence actions that might be favorable to TD but not necessarily favorable to our other stockholders.\nThe stockholders agreement provides that TD may designate five of the twelve members of our board of directors, subject to adjustment based on TD's ownership positions in TD Ameritrade. As of September 30, 2019, based on its ownership positions, TD has the right to designate five members of our board of directors. Accordingly, TD is able to significantly influence the outcome of all matters that come before our board.\nTD is permitted under the stockholders agreement to exercise voting rights on up to 45% of our outstanding shares of common stock until termination of the stockholders agreement (January 24, 2021). If our stock repurchases cause TD's ownership percentage to exceed 45%, TD is required to use reasonable efforts to sell or dispose of such excess stock, subject to TD's commercial judgment as to the optimal timing, amount and method of sales with a view to maximizing proceeds from such sales. TD has no absolute obligation to reduce its ownership percentage to 45% by the termination of the stockholders agreement. However, prior to and following the termination of the stockholders agreement, TD is required to vote any such excess stock on any matter in the same proportions as all the outstanding shares of stock held by holders other than TD and its affiliates are voted. In no event may TD Ameritrade repurchase shares of its common stock that would result in TD's ownership percentage exceeding 47%. There is no restriction on the number of shares TD may own following the termination of the stockholders agreement.\nThe ownership position and governance rights of TD could also discourage a third party from proposing a change of control or other strategic transaction concerning TD Ameritrade. As a result, our common stock could trade at prices that do not reflect a \"takeover premium\" to the same extent as do the stocks of similarly situated companies that do not have a stockholder with an ownership interest as large as TD's ownership interest.\nWe have extensive relationships and business transactions with TD and some of its affiliates, which if terminated or adversely modified could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe insured deposit account agreement between us and affiliates of TD accounts for a significant portion of our revenue. This agreement enables our clients to invest in an FDIC-insured (up to specified limits) deposit product without the need for us to establish the significant levels of capital that would be required to maintain our own bank charter. During fiscal year 2019, net revenues related to this agreement accounted for approximately 27% of our net revenues. This percentage is expected to increase in fiscal year 2020 as a result of the decrease in commissions and transaction fees on client trades. The termination or adverse modification of this agreement without replacing it on comparable terms with different counterparties, which may not be available, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If this agreement were terminated or adversely modified and we were permitted to establish our own bank charter for purposes of offering an FDIC-insured deposit product, we would be required to establish and maintain significant levels of capital within a bank subsidiary. We would also be subject to various other risks associated with banking, including credit risk on loans and investments, liquidity risk associated with bank balance sheet management, operational risks associated with banking systems and infrastructure and additional regulatory requirements and supervision.\nWhen conflicts of interest arise between TD Ameritrade and TD, they might be resolved in a manner that adversely affects our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nConflicts of interest may arise between us and TD in areas relating to a variety of past, ongoing and future relationships and contracts, including corporate opportunities, potential acquisitions or financing transactions, sales or other dispositions by TD of its interests in TD Ameritrade and the exercise by TD of its influence over our management and affairs. Some of the directors on our board are also officers or directors of TD or its subsidiaries. Service as a director or officer of both TD Ameritrade and TD or its other subsidiaries could create conflicts of interest when such directors or officers are faced with decisions that could have materially different implications for us and for TD. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains provisions relating to the avoidance of direct competition between us and TD. In addition, a committee of our board consisting of outside independent directors reviews and approves or ratifies transactions with TD and its affiliates. There can be no assurance that any of the foregoing potential conflicts would be resolved in a manner that does not adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, the provisions of the stockholders agreement related to non-competition are subject to numerous exceptions and qualifications and may not prevent us and TD from competing with each other to some degree.\nThe terms of the stockholders agreement, our charter documents and Delaware law could inhibit a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable.\nProvisions in the stockholders agreement between TD and the Company, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law will make it difficult for any party to acquire control of us in a transaction not approved by the requisite number of directors. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nthe presence of a classified board of directors;\n\u2022\nthe ability of the board of directors to issue and determine the terms of preferred stock;\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for inclusion of stockholder proposals at stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022\nthe anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law.\nThese provisions could delay, deter or prevent a change of control or change in management that might provide stockholders with a premium to the market price of their common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, substantial volatility.\nOur common stock, and the U.S. securities markets in general, have been and are subject to substantial price volatility. The price of our common stock has been known to decrease substantially and quickly. Among the factors that may affect our stock price are the following:\n\u2022\nspeculation in the investment community or the press about, or actual changes in, our competitive position, organizational structure, executive team, operations, financial condition, financial reporting and results, effectiveness of cost reduction initiatives, or strategic transactions;\n\u2022\nthe announcement of new products, services, acquisitions, or dispositions by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe pricing structure for products and services offered to customers by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nour exposure to changes in prevailing interest rates;\n\u2022\nsales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by (i) TD or (ii) J. Joe Ricketts, our founder, and certain members of his family and trusts held for their benefit, who currently have registration rights covering approximately 234 million shares and 52 million shares, respectively, of our common stock; and\n\u2022\nincreases or decreases in revenue or earnings, changes in earnings estimates by the investment community, changes in the interest rate environment or in market expectations regarding the interest rate environment and variations between estimated financial results and actual financial results.\nChanges in the stock market generally or as it concerns our industry, as well as geopolitical, economic, and business factors unrelated to us, may also affect our stock price.\nBecause the market price of our common stock can fluctuate significantly, we could become the object of securities class action litigation, which could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources and could have adverse effects on our business and the price of our common stock.\nWe are restricted by the terms of our revolving credit facilities and senior notes.\nOur senior unsecured revolving credit facilities contain various covenants and restrictions that may, in certain circumstances and subject to carveouts and exceptions, which may be material, limit our ability to:\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nchange the nature of our business;\n\u2022\nmerge or consolidate with another entity;\n\u2022\nsell all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022\nconduct transactions with affiliates.\nUnder our revolving credit facilities, we are also required to maintain compliance with a maximum consolidated leverage ratio covenant (not to exceed 3.00:1.00) and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio covenant (not less than 4.00:1:00). TDAC is required to maintain compliance with a minimum consolidated tangible net worth covenant and our broker-dealer and FCM/FDM subsidiaries are required to maintain compliance with minimum regulatory net capital covenants.\nOur senior unsecured notes contain various covenants and restrictions that may, in certain circumstances and subject to carveouts and exceptions, which may be material, limit our ability to:\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nmerge or consolidate with another entity; and\n\u2022\nsell all or substantially all of our assets.\nAs a result of the covenants and other restrictions contained in our revolving credit facilities and our senior unsecured note indentures, we are limited in how we conduct our business. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to remain in compliance with these covenants and other restrictions or be able to obtain waivers for noncompliance in the\nfuture. Failure to comply with the covenants and other restrictions contained in our debt instruments could have material adverse effects on our financial condition and business by impairing our ability to continue financing our business.\nOf particular significance, we could be forced to repay immediately and in full any outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and our senior unsecured notes if we were to breach our covenants and not cure our breach, even if we could otherwise satisfy our debt service obligations. Also, if we experience a change of control, as defined in our revolving credit facilities, we could be required to repay in full all loans outstanding thereunder, plus accrued interest and fees.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition, our results of operations and our ability to receive dividend payments from our subsidiaries, which are subject to business, economic and competitive conditions, regulatory requirements and other factors beyond our control. If our cash flows and capital resources were insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, then we could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures might not succeed and might not permit us to satisfy our scheduled debt service obligations. In addition, the terms of our existing or future debt instruments could restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives.\nAny failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to obtain additional financing. In addition, any future indebtedness could be at a higher interest rate or include covenants that are more restrictive than our current covenants.\nOur corporate debt level may limit our ability to obtain additional financing.\nAs of September 30, 2019 we had approximately $3.55 billion of long-term debt, consisting of:\n\u2022\n$600 million of variable-rate Senior Notes with principal due in full on November 1, 2021;\n\u2022\n$750 million of 2.950% Senior Notes with principal due in full on April 1, 2022;\n\u2022\n$400 million of 3.750% Senior Notes with principal due in full on April 1, 2024;\n\u2022\n$500 million of 3.625% Senior Notes with principal due in full on April 1, 2025;\n\u2022\n$800 million of 3.300% Senior Notes with principal due in full on April 1, 2027; and\n\u2022\n$500 million of 2.750% Senior Notes with principal due in full on October 1, 2029.\nOur ability to meet our cash requirements, including our debt repayment obligations, is dependent upon our future performance, which will be subject to financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are or may be beyond our control. We cannot provide assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations to fund our cash requirements. If we are unable to meet our cash requirements from operations, we would be required to obtain alternative financing. The degree to which we may be leveraged as a result of the indebtedness we have incurred could materially and adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for working capital, acquisitions or other purposes, could make us more vulnerable to industry downturns and competitive pressures or could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes and opportunities in our industry, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage. There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain alternative financing, that any such financing would be on acceptable terms or that we would be permitted to do so under the terms of existing financing arrangements. In the absence of such financing, our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions, make future acquisitions, react to adverse operating results, meet our debt repayment obligations or fund required capital expenditures could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business, financial position, and results of operations could be harmed by adverse rating actions by credit rating agencies.\nIf our counterparty credit rating or the credit ratings of our outstanding indebtedness are downgraded, or if rating agencies indicate that a downgrade may occur, then perceptions of our financial strength could be damaged and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. A downgrade would have the\neffect of increasing our incremental borrowing costs and could decrease the availability of funds for borrowing. A downgrade also could adversely affect our relationships with clients.\nOur future ability to pay regular dividends to holders of our common stock is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will be limited by our ability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flows.\nPayment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon a number of factors that the board deems relevant, including future earnings, the success of our business activities, capital and liquidity requirements, the general financial condition and future prospects of our business and general business conditions. If we are unable to generate sufficient earnings and cash flows from our business, then we may not be able to pay dividends on our common stock. Even with sufficient earnings and cash flows from our business, our board of directors might exercise its discretion by not declaring dividends, although failure to declare and pay dividends could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nIn addition, our ability to pay dividends is subject to statutory and regulatory limitations. In particular, our ability to pay dividends depends on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends. In this connection, some of our subsidiaries are subject to requirements of the SEC, FINRA, the CFTC, the NFA and other regulators relating to liquidity, capital standards and the use of client funds and securities, which may limit funds available for the payment of dividends to the parent company.\nFuture sales of equity securities could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and result in dilution.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue additional shares of common stock and to issue shares of preferred stock, without stockholder approval. We could issue additional equity securities to raise additional capital or for other purposes. The issuance of additional equity securities could dilute the interests of the holders of our common stock (including TD, except to the extent that TD exercises its right under the stockholders agreement to maintain its proportionate share of our common stock) and could adversely affect the market price of that stock.", "PERMNO": 84597, "SIC": 6211, "TIC": "AMTD"}
