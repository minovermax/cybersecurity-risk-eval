{"cik": "1718227", "company": "Construction Partners, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-12-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nAn investment in our Class A common stock involves certain risks. You should carefully read and consider the following risks, as well as all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making an investment decision. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks. As a result, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial also may adversely affect us.\nRisks Related to our Business\nA significant slowdown or decline in economic conditions, particularly in the southeastern United States, could adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe currently operate in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. A significant slowdown or decline in economic conditions or uncertainty regarding the economic outlook in the United States generally, or in any of these states particularly, could result in reduced demand for infrastructure projects, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Demand for infrastructure projects depends on the overall condition of the national and local economies, the need for new or replacement infrastructure, the priorities placed on various projects funded by governmental entities and federal, state and local government spending levels. In particular, low tax revenues, credit rating downgrades, budget deficits and financing constraints, including timing and amount of federal funding and competing governmental priorities, could negatively impact the ability of government agencies to fund existing or new public infrastructure projects. For example, during the most recent recession, decreases in tax revenues reduced funding for infrastructure projects. In addition, any instability in the financial and credit markets could negatively impact our customers\u2019 ability to pay us on a timely basis, or at all, for work on projects already in progress, could cause our customers to delay or cancel construction projects in our contract backlog and/or could create difficulties for customers to obtain adequate financing to fund new construction projects, including through the issuance of municipal bonds.\nOur business is dependent on federal, state and local government spending for public infrastructure construction, and reductions in government funding could adversely affect our results of operations.\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, we generated approximately 67% of our construction contract revenues from publicly funded construction projects at the federal, state and local levels. As a result, if publicly funded construction decreases due to reduced federal, state or local funding or otherwise, our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity could be materially adversely affected.\nIn January 2011, Congress repealed a 1998 transportation law that protected annual highway funding levels from amendments that could reduce such funding. This change subjected federal highway funding to annual appropriation reviews, which has increased the uncertainty of many state DOTs regarding the availability of highway project funds. This uncertainty could cause state DOTs to be reluctant to undertake large multiyear highway projects, which could, in turn, negatively affect our results of operations.\nFederal highway bills provide spending authorizations that represent maximum amounts. Each year, Congress passes an appropriation act establishing the amount that can be used for particular programs. The annual funding level is generally tied to receipts of highway user taxes placed in the Highway Trust Fund (as defined in the FAST Act). Once Congress passes the annual appropriation, the federal government distributes funds to each state based on formulas or other procedures. States generally must spend these funds on the specific programs outlined in the federal legislation. In recent years, the Highway Trust Fund has faced insolvency as outlays have outpaced revenues. Annual shortfalls have been addressed primarily by short-term measures, including the transfer of funds from the General Fund (as defined in the FAST Act) into the Highway Trust Fund. As a result, we cannot be assured of the existence, timing or amount of future federal highway funding. Any reduction in federal highway funding, particularly in the amounts allocated to Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nEach state funds its infrastructure spending from specially allocated amounts collected from various taxes, typically fuel taxes and vehicle fees, as well as from voter-approved bond programs. Shortages in state tax revenues can reduce the amount spent on state infrastructure projects. Delays in state infrastructure spending can adversely affect our business. Many states have experienced state-level funding pressures caused by lower tax revenues and an inability to finance approved projects. Prior to the FAST Act, states took on a larger role in funding sustained infrastructure investment. During the past three years, many states have again taken on a significantly larger role in funding infrastructure investment, including initiating special-purpose taxes and increased fuel taxes.\nWhile the current administration has announced an infrastructure stimulus plan, we cannot predict the impact, if any, that it or other proposed changes in law and regulations may have on our business.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from state DOTs. The loss of our ability to competitively bid for certain projects or successfully contract with state DOTs could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur largest customers are state DOTs. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, the Alabama DOT and the North Carolina DOT accounted for 15.1% and 13.3% of our revenues, respectively, and projects performed for all DOTs accounted for 42.9% of revenues. We believe that we will continue to rely on state DOTs for a substantial portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. The loss or reduction of our ability to competitively bid for certain projects or successfully contract with a state DOT could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and liquidity. See Note 3 - Significant Accounting Policies, Concentration of Risks, to the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for information relating to concentrations of revenues by type of customer and for a description of our largest customers.\nGovernment contracts generally are subject to a variety of governmental regulations, requirements and statutes, the violation or alleged violation of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, approximately 67% of our construction contract revenues were derived from contracts funded by federal, state and local governmental agencies. Our contracts with these governmental agencies are generally subject to specific procurement regulations, contract provisions and a variety of socioeconomic requirements relating to their formation, administration, performance and accounting and often include express or implied certifications of compliance. Further, government contracts typically provide for termination at the convenience of the customer with requirements to pay us for work performed through the date of termination. We may be subject to claims for civil or criminal fraud for actual or alleged violations of these various governmental regulations, requirements or statutes. In addition, we may also be subject to qui tam litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government under the Federal Civil False Claims Act, which could include claims for treble damages. Further, if we fail to comply with any of these various governmental regulations, requirements or statutes, or if we have a substantial number of accumulated OSHA, MSHA or other workplace safety violations, our existing government contracts could be terminated, and we could be suspended from government contracting or subcontracting, including federally funded projects at the state level. Even if we have not violated these various governmental regulations, requirements or statutes, allegations of violations or defending qui tam litigation could harm our reputation and require us to incur material costs to defend any such allegations or lawsuits. Should one or more of these events occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.\nIf we do not comply with certain federal or state laws, we could be suspended or debarred from government contracting, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nVarious statutes to which our operations are subject, including the Davis-Bacon Act (regulating wages and benefits), the Walsh-Healy Act (prescribing a minimum wage and regulating overtime and working conditions), Executive Order 11246 (establishing equal employment opportunity and affirmative action requirements) and the Drug-Free Workplace Act, provide for mandatory suspension and/or debarment of contractors in certain circumstances involving statutory violations. In addition, the Federal Acquisition Regulation and various state statutes provide for discretionary suspension and/or debarment in certain circumstances, including as a result of being convicted of, or being found civilly liable for, fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain or performing a public contract or subcontract. The scope and duration of any suspension or debarment may vary depending upon the facts of a particular case and the statutory or regulatory grounds for debarment. Any suspension or debarment from government contracting could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nIf we are unable to accurately estimate the overall risks, revenues or costs on our projects, we may incur contract losses or achieve lower than anticipated profits.\nPricing on a fixed unit price contract is based on approved quantities irrespective of our actual costs, and contracts with a fixed total price require that the work be performed for a single price irrespective of our actual costs. We only generate profits on fixed unit price and fixed total price contracts when our revenues exceed our actual costs, which requires us to accurately estimate our costs, to control actual costs and to avoid cost overruns. If our cost estimates are too low or if we do not perform the contract within our cost estimates, then cost overruns may cause us to incur a loss or cause the contract not to be as profitable as we expected. The costs incurred and profit realized, if any, on our contracts can vary, sometimes substantially, from our original projections due to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe failure to include materials or work in a bid, or the failure to estimate properly the quantities or costs needed to complete a fixed total price contract;\n\u2022\ndelays caused by weather conditions or otherwise failing to meet scheduled acceptance dates;\n\u2022\ncontract or project modifications or conditions creating unanticipated costs that are not covered by change orders;\n\u2022\nchanges in the availability, proximity and costs of materials, including liquid asphalt cement, aggregates and other construction materials, as well as fuel and lubricants for our equipment;\n\u2022\nto the extent not covered by contractual cost escalators, variability and inability to predict the costs of purchasing diesel, liquid asphalt and cement;\n\u2022\nthe availability and skill level of workers;\n\u2022\nthe failure by our suppliers, subcontractors, designers, engineers or customers to perform their obligations;\n\u2022\nfraud, theft or other improper activities by our suppliers, subcontractors, designers, engineers, customers or our own personnel;\n\u2022\nmechanical problems with our machinery or equipment;\n\u2022\ncitations issued by a government authority, including OSHA or MSHA citations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in obtaining required government permits or approvals;\n\u2022\nchanges in applicable laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nuninsured claims or demands from third parties for alleged damages arising from the design, construction or use and operation of a project of which our work is part; and\n\u2022\npublic infrastructure customers seeking to impose contractual risk-shifting provisions that result in increased risks to us.\nThese factors, as well as others, may cause us to incur losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nBecause our industry is capital-intensive and we have significant fixed and semi-fixed costs, our profitability is sensitive to changes in volume.\nThe property, plants and equipment needed to produce our products and provide our services can be very expensive. We must spend a substantial amount of capital to purchase and maintain such property, plants and equipment. Although we believe our current cash balance, along with our projected internal cash flows and available financing sources, will provide sufficient cash to support our currently anticipated operating and capital needs, if we are unable to generate sufficient cash to purchase and maintain the property, plants and equipment necessary to operate our business, we may be required to reduce or delay planned capital expenditures or to incur additional indebtedness. In addition, due to the level of fixed and semi-fixed costs associated with our business, particularly at our HMA production facilities, volume decreases could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nThe cancellation of a significant number of contracts, our disqualification from bidding for new contracts and the unpredictable timing of new contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe could be prohibited from bidding on certain government contracts if we fail to maintain qualifications required by those entities. In addition, government contracts typically can be canceled at any time with us receiving payment only for the work completed. The cancellation of an unfinished contract, or our disqualification from the bidding process, could result in lost revenues and cause our equipment to be idled for a significant period of time until other comparable work becomes available. Additionally, the timing of project awards is unpredictable and outside of our control. Project awards, including expansions of existing projects, often involve complex and lengthy negotiations and competitive bidding processes.\nThe success of our business depends, in part, on our ability to execute on our acquisition strategy, to successfully integrate acquired businesses and to retain key employees of acquired businesses.\nOver the past 17 years, we have acquired and integrated 16 complementary businesses, which have contributed to a significant portion of our growth. We continue to evaluate strategic acquisition opportunities that have the potential to support and strengthen our business, including acquisitions in states in the southeastern United States, as part of our ongoing growth strategy. We expect to evaluate, negotiate and enter into possible acquisition transactions on an ongoing basis in the future. We expect to regularly make non-binding acquisition proposals, and we may enter into non-binding, confidential letters of intent from time to time in the future. We cannot predict the timing or size of any future acquisitions. To successfully acquire a significant target, we may need to raise additional equity and/or indebtedness, which could increase our leverage level. There can be no assurance that we will enter into definitive agreements with respect to any contemplated transaction or that any contemplated transaction will be completed. The investigation of acquisition candidates and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial costs for accountants, attorneys and others. If we fail to complete any acquisition for any reason, including events beyond our control, the costs incurred up to that point for the proposed acquisition likely would not be recoverable.\nAcquisitions typically require integration of the acquired company\u2019s estimation, project management, finance, information technology, risk management, purchasing and fleet management functions. We may be unable to successfully integrate an acquired business into our existing business, and an acquired business may not be as profitable as we had expected or at all. Our inability to successfully integrate new businesses in a timely and orderly manner could increase costs, reduce profits or generate losses. Factors affecting the successful integration of an acquired business include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nwe may become liable for certain liabilities of an acquired business, whether or not known to us, which could include, among others, tax liabilities, product liabilities, environmental liabilities and liabilities for employment practices;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to retain local managers and key employees who are important to the operations of an acquired business;\n\u2022\nsubstantial attention from our senior management and the management of an acquired business may be required, which could decrease the time that they have to service and attract customers;\n\u2022\nwe may not effectively utilize new equipment that we acquire through acquisitions;\n\u2022\nthe complete integration of an acquired company depends, to a certain extent, on the full implementation of our financial and management information systems, business practices and policies; and\n\u2022\nwe may actively pursue a number of opportunities simultaneously and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, complications and delays, including difficulties in employing sufficient staff and maintaining operational and management oversight.\nAcquisitions involve risks that the acquired business will not perform as expected and that business judgments concerning the value, strengths and weaknesses of the acquired business will prove incorrect. In addition, potential acquisition targets may be in states in which we do not currently operate, which could result in unforeseen operating difficulties and difficulties in coordinating geographically dispersed operations, personnel and facilities. In addition, if we enter into new geographic markets, we may be subject to additional and unfamiliar legal and regulatory requirements.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will achieve synergies and cost savings in connection with future acquisitions. Many of the businesses that we previously acquired, and businesses that we may acquire in the future, could have unaudited financial statements that are prepared by management and are not independently reviewed or audited. We cannot guarantee that such financial statements would not be materially different if such statements were independently reviewed or audited. We cannot guarantee that we will continue to acquire businesses at valuations consistent with our prior acquisitions or that we will complete future acquisitions at all. We cannot guarantee that there will be attractive acquisition opportunities at reasonable prices, that financing will be available or that we can successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations. In addition, our results of operations from these acquisitions could, in the future, result in impairment charges for any of our intangible assets, including goodwill or other long-lived assets, particularly if economic conditions worsen unexpectedly. Our inability to effectively manage the integration of our completed and future acquisitions could prevent us from realizing expected rates of return on an acquired business and could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nWe may lose business to competitors that underbid us, and we may be unable to compete favorably in our highly competitive industry.\nMost of our project awards are determined through a competitive bidding process in which price is the determining factor. Because of the high cost of transporting HMA, our ability to win a project award is often influenced by the distance between a work site and our HMA plants. We compete against multiple competitors in all of the markets in which we operate, most of which are local or regional operators. Some of our competitors are larger than we are, are vertically integrated and/or have similar or greater financial resources than we do. As a result, our competitors may be able to bid at lower prices than we can due to the location of their plants or as a result of their size or vertical-integration advantages. Government funding for public infrastructure projects is limited, thus contributing to competition for the limited number of public projects available. An increase in competition may result in a decrease in new project awards to us at acceptable profit margins. In addition, in the event of a downturn in private residential and commercial construction, the competition for available public infrastructure projects could intensify, which could materially and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nWe may be unable to obtain or maintain sufficient bonding capacity, which could materially adversely affect our business.\nA significant number of our contracts require performance and payment bonds. Our ability to obtain performance and payment bonds primarily depends upon our capitalization, working capital, past performance, management expertise, reputation and certain external factors, including the overall capacity of the surety market. If we are unable to renew or obtain a sufficient level of bonding capacity in the future, we may be precluded from being able to bid for certain projects or successfully contract with certain customers. In addition, even if we are able to successfully renew or obtain performance or payment bonds, we may be required to post letters of credit in connection with such bonds, which could negatively affect our liquidity and results of operations.\nIt is standard for sureties to issue or continue bonds on a project-by-project basis, and they can decline to do so at any time or require the posting of additional collateral as a condition thereto. Events that adversely affect the insurance and bonding markets generally may result in bonding becoming more difficult or costly to obtain in the future. If we were to experience an interruption or reduction in the availability of our bonding capacity as a result of these or any other reasons, or if bonding costs were to increase, we may be unable to compete for certain projects that require bonding, which would materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nOur business is seasonal and subject to adverse weather conditions, which can adversely impact our business.\nOur construction operations occur outdoors. As a result, seasonal changes and adverse weather conditions can adversely affect our business operations through a decline in both the use and production of HMA, a decline in the demand for our construction services and alterations and delays in our construction schedules. Adverse weather conditions, such as extended snowy, rainy or cold weather in the winter, spring or fall can reduce demand for our products and reduce sales or render our contracting operations less efficient, resulting in under-utilization of crews and equipment and lower contract profitability. Major weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, tropical storms and heavy snows, could also adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nWe depend on information technology, and our systems and infrastructure face certain risks, including cybersecurity risks and data leakage risks.\nWe are dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure that could be damaged or interrupted by a variety of factors. Any significant breach, breakdown, destruction or interruption of these systems by employees, others with authorized access to our systems or unauthorized persons has the potential to negatively affect our operations. There is also a risk that we could experience a business interruption, theft of information or reputational damage as a result of a cyberattack, such as the infiltration of a data center, or data leakage of confidential information either internally or at our third-party providers. Although we have invested in the protection of our data and information technology to reduce these risks and periodically test the security of our information systems network, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nDesign-build contracts subject us to the risk of design errors and omissions.\nDesign-build contracts are used as a method of project delivery that provides the owner with a single point of responsibility for both design and construction. We generally subcontract design responsibility to architectural and engineering firms. However, in the event of a design error or omission that causes damages, there is a risk that the subcontractor and/or its errors and omissions insurance would not be able to absorb the full amount of the liability incurred. In this case, we may be responsible for the liability, resulting in a potentially material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nOur continued success requires us to hire, train and retain qualified personnel and subcontractors in a competitive industry.\nThe success of our business depends upon our ability to attract, train and retain qualified, reliable personnel, including, but not limited to, our executive officers and key management personnel. Additionally, the successful operation of our business depends upon engineers, project management personnel, other employees and qualified subcontractors who possess the necessary and required experience and expertise and who will perform their respective services at a reasonable and competitive rate. Competition for these and other experienced personnel is intense, and it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the requisite expertise and in the timeframe demanded by our clients. In certain geographic areas, for example, we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire, train and retain qualified personnel. Also, it could be difficult to replace personnel who hold government-granted eligibility that may be required to obtain certain government projects and/or who have significant government contract experience.\nAs some of our executives and other key personnel approach retirement age, we must provide for smooth transitions, which may require that we devote time and resources to identify and integrate new personnel into vacant leadership roles and other key\npositions. If we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of skilled personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans, our ability to pursue projects and our strategic plan may be adversely affected, the costs of executing both our existing and future projects may increase and our financial performance may decline.\nIn addition, the cost of providing our services, including the extent to which we utilize our workforce, affects our profitability. For example, the uncertainty of contract award timing can present difficulties in matching our workforce size with our contracts. If an expected contract award is delayed or not received, we could incur costs resulting from excess staff or redundancy of facilities that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on third parties for equipment and supplies essential to operate our business.\nWe rely on third parties to sell or lease properties, plants and equipment to us and to provide us with supplies, including liquid asphalt cement, aggregates and other construction materials (such as stone, gravel and sand), necessary for our operations. We cannot assure you that our favorable working relationships with our suppliers will continue in the future. In addition, there have historically been periods of supply shortages in our industry.\nThe inability to purchase or lease the properties, plants or equipment that are necessary for our operations could severely impact our business. If we lose our supply contracts and receive insufficient supplies from third parties to meet our customers\u2019 needs, or if our suppliers experience price increases or disruptions to their business, such as labor disputes, supply shortages or distribution problems, our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe consume natural gas, electricity, diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and other petroleum-based resources that are subject to potential reliability issues, supply constraints and significant price fluctuations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nIn our production and distribution processes, we consume significant amounts of natural gas, electricity, diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and other petroleum-based resources. The availability and pricing of these resources are subject to market forces that are beyond our control, such as unavailability due to refinery turnarounds, higher prices charged for petroleum-based products, and other factors. Furthermore, we are vulnerable to any reliability issues experienced by our suppliers, which also are beyond our control. Our suppliers contract separately for the purchase of such resources, and our sources of supply could be interrupted if our suppliers are unable to obtain these materials due to higher demand or other factors that interrupt their availability. Additionally, increases in the costs of fuel and other petroleum-based products utilized in our operations, particularly increases following a bid based on lower costs for such products, could result in a lower profit, or a loss, on a contract. Variability in the supply and prices of these resources could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nOur contract backlog is subject to reductions in scope and cancellations and therefore could be an unreliable indicator of our future earnings.\nAt September 30, 2018, our contract backlog was $594.4 million, compared to $549.9 million at September 30, 2017. Our contract backlog generally consists of construction projects for which we either have an executed contract or commitment with a client or where we are the current low bid. Contract backlog does not include external sales of HMA and aggregates. Moreover, our contract backlog reflects our expected revenues from the contract, commitment or bid, which is often subject to revision over time. We cannot guarantee that the revenues projected in our contract backlog will be realized or, if realized, will be profitable. Projects reflected in our contract backlog may be affected by project cancellations, scope adjustments, time extensions or other changes. Such changes may adversely affect the revenues and profit we ultimately realize on these projects.\nFailure of our subcontractors to perform as expected could have a negative impact on our results.\nWe rely on third-party subcontractors to perform some of the work on many of our contracts, but we are ultimately responsible for the successful completion of their work. Although we seek to require bonding or other forms of guarantees from our subcontractors, we are not always able to obtain such bonds or guarantees. In situations where we are unable to obtain a bond or guarantee, we may be responsible for the failures on the part of our subcontractors to perform as anticipated, resulting in a potentially adverse impact on our cash flows and liquidity. In addition, if the total costs of a project exceed our original estimates, we could experience reduced profits or a loss for that project, which could have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nThe construction services industry is highly schedule-driven, and our failure to meet the schedule requirements of our contracts could adversely affect our reputation and/or expose us to financial liability.\nIn some instances, including in the case of many of our fixed unit price contracts, we guarantee that we will complete a project by a certain date. Any failure to meet contractual schedule or completion requirements set forth in our contracts could subject us to responsibility for costs resulting from the delay, generally in the form of contractually agreed-upon liquidated damages, liability for our customer\u2019s actual costs arising out of our delay, reduced profits or a loss on that project, damage to our reputation and a material adverse impact to our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nIncreasing restrictions on securing aggregate reserves could have a negative impact on our future results of operations.\nIncreasingly strict regulations and the limited nature of properties containing useful aggregate reserves have made it increasingly challenging and costly to obtain aggregate reserves. Although we have been able to obtain adequate reserves to support our business in the past, our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity may be adversely affected by increasingly strict regulations.\nForce majeure events, such as natural disasters and terrorist attacks, and unexpected equipment failures could negatively impact our business, which may affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nForce majeure events, such as terrorist attacks or natural disasters, have impacted, and could continue to negatively impact, the United States economy and the markets in which we operate. As an example, from time to time, we face unexpected severe weather conditions, evacuation of personnel and curtailment of services, increased labor and material costs or shortages, inability to deliver materials, equipment and personnel to work sites in accordance with contract schedules and loss of productivity. We seek to include language in our private client contracts that grants us certain relief in connection with force majeure events, and we attempt to mitigate the potential impact arising from force majeure events in both public and private client contracts. However, the extra costs incurred as a result of these events may not be reimbursed by our clients, and we remain obligated to perform our services after most extraordinary events, subject to any relief that may be available pursuant to a force majeure clause.\nAdditionally, our manufacturing processes are dependent upon critical pieces of equipment, such as our HMA plants. This equipment, on occasion, may be out of service as a result of unanticipated failures or damage. Any significant interruption in production capability may require us to make significant capital expenditures to remedy problems or damage and cause us to lose revenues due to lost production time.\nThese force majeure events may affect our operations or those of our customers or suppliers and could impact our revenues, production capability and ability to complete contracts in a timely manner.\nA failure to obtain or maintain adequate insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations.\nAs part of our overall risk management strategy and pursuant to requirements to maintain specific coverage that are contained in our financing agreements and in a majority of our contracts, we have obtained and maintain insurance coverage.\nAlthough we have been able to obtain reasonably priced insurance coverage to meet our requirements in the past, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future. For example, catastrophic events can result in decreased coverage limits, more limited coverage, and increased premium costs or deductibles. If we are unable to obtain adequate insurance coverage, we may not be able to procure certain contracts, which could materially adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, cash flows or liquidity.\nWe could incur material costs and losses as a result of claims that our products do not meet regulatory requirements or contractual specifications.\nWe provide our customers with products designed to comply with building codes or other regulatory requirements, as well as any applicable contractual specifications, including, but not limited to, durability, compressive strength and weight-bearing capacity. If our products do not satisfy these requirements and specifications, material claims may arise against us, our reputation could be damaged and, if any such claims are for an uninsured, non-indemnified or product-related claim, resolution of such claim against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nEnvironmental, health and safety laws and regulations and any changes to, or liabilities arising under, such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nOur operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection and public health and safety. These laws and regulations impose numerous obligations applicable to our operations, including: a requirement to obtain a permit or other approval before conducting regulated activities; restrictions on the types, quantities and concentration of materials that can be released into the environment; limitation or prohibition of activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, and other protected areas; application of specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection; and imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations. Numerous government authorities, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the \u201cEPA\u201d) and analogous state agencies, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them. Such enforcement actions often involve difficult and costly compliance measures or corrective actions. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil or criminal penalties, compensatory damages, the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations, and the issuance of orders limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations. In addition, we may experience delays in obtaining, or be unable to obtain, required permits, which may delay or interrupt our operations and limit our growth and revenue.\nCertain environmental laws impose strict liability (i.e., no showing of \u201cfault\u201d is required) or joint and several liability for costs required to remediate and restore sites where hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or solid wastes have been stored or released. We may be required to remediate contaminated properties currently or formerly owned or operated by us or third-party facilities that received waste generated by our operations, regardless of whether such contamination resulted from the conduct of others or from the consequences of our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. In connection with certain acquisitions, we could assume, or be required to provide indemnification against, environmental liabilities that could expose us to material losses. Furthermore, the existence of contamination at properties we own, lease or operate could result in increased operational costs or restrictions on our ability to use those properties as intended, including for mining purposes.\nIn certain instances, citizen groups also have the ability to bring legal proceedings against us if we are not in compliance with environmental laws, or to challenge our ability to receive environmental permits that we need to operate. In addition, claims for damages to persons or property, including natural resources, may result from the environmental, health and safety impacts of our operations. Our insurance may not cover all environmental risks and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage if an environmental claim is made against us. Moreover, public interest in the protection of the environment has increased dramatically in recent years. The trend of more expansive and stringent environmental legislation and regulations applied to our industry could continue, resulting in increased costs of doing business and, consequently, affecting profitability.\nThe risks associated with climate change, as well as climate change legislation and regulations, could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nThe physical risks of climate change, such as more frequent or more extreme weather events, changes in temperature and precipitation patterns, changes to ground and surface water availability and other related phenomena, could affect some, or all, of our operations. Severe weather or other natural disasters could be destructive, which could result in increased costs, including supply chain costs.\nIn addition, a number of governmental bodies have finalized, proposed or are contemplating legislative and regulatory actions in response to growing concerns about climate change. In recent years, federal, state and local governments have taken steps to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. The EPA has finalized a series of greenhouse gas monitoring, reporting and emissions control rules for certain large sources of greenhouse gases, and the U.S. Congress has, from time to time, considered adopting legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Nearly half of the states have already taken measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, primarily through the development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and/or regional greenhouse gas cap-and-trade programs. Whether or not the United States participates in international commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the federal level, many state and local officials have announced their commitment to upholding such commitments.\nAlthough it is not possible at this time to predict how future legislation or regulations to address greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business, any such laws and regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of greenhouse gases from, our equipment and operations, could require us to incur costs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with our operations. Because we emit greenhouse gases through the manufacture of HMA products and through the combustion of fossil fuels as part of our mining and road construction services, such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nOur operations are subject to special hazards that may cause personal injury or property damage, subjecting us to liabilities and possible losses that may not be covered by insurance.\nOperating hazards inherent in our business, some of which may be outside our control, can cause personal injury and loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, plant and equipment and environmental damage. We maintain insurance coverage in amounts and against risks that we believe are consistent with industry practice, but this insurance may be inadequate or unavailable to cover all losses or liabilities we may incur in our operations. Our insurance policies are subject to varying levels of deductibles. Losses up to our deductible amounts are accrued based upon our estimates of the ultimate liability for claims incurred and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported. However, liabilities subject to insurance are difficult to estimate due to unknown factors, including the severity of an injury, the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties, the number of unreported incidents and the effectiveness of our safety programs. If we were to experience insurance claims or costs above our estimates, we may be required to use working capital to satisfy these claims rather than using working capital to maintain or expand our operations.\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations.\nConstruction Partners Holdings, Inc. (\u201cConstruction Partners Holdings\u201d), our wholly owned subsidiary, is party to a credit agreement with Compass Bank, as agent, sole lead arranger and sole bookrunner (as amended, the \u201cCompass Credit Agreement\u201d). The Compass Credit Agreement provides for a $72.0 million term loan (the \u201cCompass Term Loan\u201d) and a $30.0 million revolving credit facility (the \u201cCompass Revolving Credit Facility\u201d). We guarantee the obligations under the Term Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility. A significant portion of our cash flow will be required to pay interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness, and we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or have future borrowings available, to enable us to repay our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs. This level of indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe may be required to use a significant percentage of our cash flow from operations for debt service and the repayment of our indebtedness, and any such cash flow would not be available for other purposes;\n\u2022\nour ability to borrow money or issue equity to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and debt service requirements may be limited;\n\u2022\nour interest expense could increase if interest rates in general increase because a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at floating rates;\n\u2022\nour flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and future business opportunities may be limited;\n\u2022\nwe may be more highly leveraged than some of our competitors, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage;\n\u2022\nwe may be more vulnerable to a downturn in our business or the economy; and\n\u2022\nour ability to exploit business opportunities may be limited.\nDespite our substantial indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur additional debt. This could reduce our ability to satisfy our current obligations and further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above.\nAt September 30, 2018, we had $57.3 million outstanding under the Term Loan and $5.0 million outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future, and we may do so, among other reasons, to fund acquisitions as part of our growth strategy. Although the Compass Credit Agreement contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and we could incur substantial additional indebtedness in compliance with these restrictions.\nThe Compass Credit Agreement restricts our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to engage in some business and financial transactions.\nThe Compass Credit Agreement contains a number of covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to: incur additional indebtedness or guarantees; create liens on assets; change our or our subsidiaries' fiscal year; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; enter into certain restrictive agreements; engage in mergers or consolidations; participate in partnerships and joint ventures; sell assets; incur additional liens; pay dividends or distributions and make other restricted payments; make investments, loans or advances; repay or amend terms of subordinated indebtedness; make certain acquisitions; enter into certain operating leases; enter into certain hedge transactions; amend material contracts; and engage in certain transactions with affiliates.\nThe Compass Credit Agreement also requires us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio and a consolidated leverage ratio and contains certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default (including, among others, an event of default upon a change of control). If an event of default occurs, the lenders under the Compass Credit Agreement will be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due thereunder and all actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor. Our failure to comply with our obligations under the Compass Credit Agreement may result in an event of default under the Compass Credit Agreement. A default, if not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of our indebtedness. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds available to pay the accelerated indebtedness or that we will have the ability to refinance the accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us or at all.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and/or acquisitions, and we may not be able to do so on favorable terms or at all, which would impair our ability to operate our business or achieve our growth objectives.\nOur ongoing ability to generate cash is important for the funding of our continuing operations, making acquisitions and servicing our indebtedness. To the extent that existing cash balances and cash flow from operations, together with borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility, are insufficient to make investments or acquisitions or provide needed working capital, we may require additional financing from other sources. Our ability to obtain such additional financing in the future will depend in part upon prevailing capital market conditions, as well as conditions in our business and our operating results, and those factors may affect our efforts to arrange additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us. Furthermore, if global economic, political or other market conditions adversely affect the financial institutions that provide credit to us, it is possible that our ability to draw upon our Revolving Credit Facility may be impacted. If adequate funds are not available, or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to make future investments, take advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities, or respond to competitive challenges, resulting in loss of market share, each of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nWe may be unable to identify and contract with qualified Disadvantaged Business Enterprise contractors to perform as subcontractors.\nSome of our contracts with governmental agencies contain minimum Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (\u201cDBE\u201d) participation clauses, which require us to maintain a requisite level of DBE participation. If we fail to obtain or maintain such requisite level of DBE participation, we could be held responsible for breach of contract. Such breach may result in the placement of restrictions on our ability to bid on future projects as well as monetary damages. To the extent we are responsible for monetary damages, the total costs of the project could exceed our original estimates, we could experience reduced profits or a loss for that project and there could be a material adverse impact to our financial position, results of operations, cash flows or liquidity.\nFailure to maintain safe work sites could result in significant losses, which could materially affect our business and reputation.\nBecause our employees and others are often in close proximity with mechanized equipment, moving vehicles, chemical substances and dangerous manufacturing processes, our construction and maintenance sites are potentially dangerous workplaces. Therefore, safety is a primary focus of our business and is critical to our reputation and performance. Many of our clients require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid on contracts, and some of our contract fees or profits are subject to satisfying safety criteria. Unsafe work conditions also can increase employee turnover, which increases project costs and therefore our overall operating costs. If we fail to implement safety procedures or implement ineffective safety procedures, our employees could be injured, and we could be exposed to investigations and possible litigation. Our failure to maintain adequate safety standards through our safety programs could also result in reduced profitability or the loss of projects or clients, and could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows or liquidity.\nIn connection with acquisitions, we have recorded goodwill that could become impaired and adversely affect our operating results. Assessing whether impairment has occurred requires us to make significant judgments and assumptions about the future, which are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, and if actual events turn out to be materially less favorable than the judgments we make and the assumptions we use, we may be required to record impairment charges in the future.\nAt September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, we had $32.9 million and $30.6 million, respectively, of goodwill recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We assess goodwill for impairment annually or more often if required. Our assessments involve a number of estimates and assumptions that are inherently subjective and require significant judgment regarding highly uncertain matters that are subject to change. The use of different assumptions or estimates could materially affect the determination as to whether or not an impairment has occurred. In addition, if future events are less favorable than what we assumed or estimated in our impairment analysis, we may be required to record an impairment charge, which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nOur earnings are affected by the application of accounting standards and our critical accounting policies, which involve subjective judgments and estimates by our management. Our actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used to prepare our consolidated financial statements.\nThe accounting standards we use in preparing our financial statements are often complex and require that we make significant estimates and assumptions in interpreting and applying those standards. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported values of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. We make critical estimates and assumptions involving accounting matters, including our revenue recognition, contracts receivable including retainage, valuation of long-lived assets and goodwill, income taxes, accrued insurance costs and share-based payments and other equity transactions. These estimates and assumptions involve matters that are inherently uncertain and require us to make subjective and complex judgments. If we used different estimates and assumptions or used different ways to determine these estimates, our financial results could differ.\nOur actual business and financial results could differ from our estimates of such results, which could have a material negative impact on our financial condition and reported results of operations. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.\u201d\nThe percentage-of-completion method of accounting for contract revenues involves significant estimates that may result in material adjustments, which could result in a charge against our earnings.\nWe recognize contract revenues using the percentage-of-completion accounting method. Under this method, revenues are recognized as costs are incurred in an amount equal to cost plus the related expected profit based on the ratio of costs incurred to estimated final costs. Contract costs consist of direct costs on contracts, including labor, materials, amounts payable to subcontractors and those indirect costs related to contract performance, such as equipment costs, insurance and employee benefits. Contract cost is recorded as incurred, and revisions in contract revenues and cost estimates are reflected in the accounting period when known. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. Changes in job performance, job conditions and estimated profitability, including those changes arising from contract change orders, penalty provisions and final contract settlements, may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. Estimated contract losses are recognized in full when determined. Total contract revenues and cost estimates are reviewed and revised at a minimum on a quarterly basis as the work progresses and as change orders are approved. Adjustments based upon the percentage-of-completion method are reflected in contract revenues in the period when these estimates are revised. To the extent that these adjustments result in an increase or a reduction in or an elimination of previously reported contract profit, we recognize a credit or a charge against current earnings, as applicable. Such credits or charges could be material and could cause our results to fluctuate materially from period to period.\nAccounting for our contract-related revenues and costs, as well as other expenses, requires management to make a variety of significant estimates and assumptions. Although we believe we have the experience and processes to enable us to formulate appropriate assumptions and produce reasonably dependable estimates, these assumptions and estimates may change significantly in the future and could result in the reversal of previously recognized revenues and profit. Such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nThe dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with SunTx and its affiliates, which limits your ability to influence corporate matters.\nOur Class B common stock has ten votes per share, and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. As of December 10, 2018, holders of our Class B common stock, including SunTx, its affiliates and certain other stockholders, together hold approximately 97.1% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. Because of the ten-to-one voting ratio between our Class B common stock and our Class A common stock, the holders of our Class B common stock collectively control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore control the outcome of all matters submitted to our stockholders. This concentrated control limits or precludes your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future.\nFuture transfers of shares of our Class B common stock generally will result in those shares converting into shares of our Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers to permitted transferees. The conversion of shares of our Class B common stock into our Class A common stock will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of each individual holder of shares of our Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long-term.\nWe have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, substantial costs as a result of being a public company, which may significantly affect our financial condition.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, including costs associated with our public company reporting requirements. We also incur costs associated with corporate governance requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d) and the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 and rules implemented by the SEC. We expect these rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly, particularly after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act. For example, as a result of becoming a publicly traded company, we are required to adopt policies regarding internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures, including the preparation of reports on internal control over financial reporting. We also expect these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers.\nAfter we are no longer an emerging growth company, we expect to incur significant additional expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with those requirements applicable to companies that are not emerging growth companies, including Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (\"Section 404\").\nFor so long as we are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we will not be required to comply with certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies, and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies could make our Class A common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d (as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the \"JOBS Act\"), and we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict whether investors will find our Class A common stock less attractive because we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our Class A common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our Class A common stock, and our Class A common stock price may be more volatile.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which our total revenues equals or exceeds $1.07 billion, (ii) September 30, 2023, which is the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities and (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d under the Exchange Act.\nWe are subject to certain requirements of Section 404 beginning in fiscal year 2019. If we are unable to timely comply with such requirements or if the costs related to compliance are significant, our profitability, stock price, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe are required to comply with certain provisions of Section 404, which requires that we document and test our internal control over financial reporting and issue management\u2019s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting beginning with the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019. Section 404 also requires that our independent registered public accounting firm opine on those internal controls upon becoming an accelerated filer, as defined in the SEC rules, or otherwise ceasing to qualify for an exemption from the requirement to provide auditors\u2019 attestation on internal controls afforded to emerging growth companies under the JOBS Act.\nWe believe that the out-of-pocket costs, the diversion of management\u2019s attention from running the day-to-day operations and operational changes caused by the need to comply with the requirements of Section 404 could be significant. If the time and costs associated with such compliance exceed our current expectations, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe cannot be certain at this time that we will be able to successfully complete the procedures, certification and attestation requirements of Section 404 or that we or our auditors will not identify further material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we fail to comply with such requirements, or if at any time after becoming a public company, we or our auditors identify and report any material weaknesses, the accuracy and timeliness of the filing of our annual and quarterly reports may be materially adversely affected and could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition, a material weakness in the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could result in an increased chance of fraud and the loss of customers, reduce our ability to obtain financing, subject us to investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities and require additional expenditures to comply with these requirements, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, and if we are unable to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in our consolidated financial statements and our Company, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our stock price.\nIn the course of preparing the financial statements for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, our management determined that we have material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which relate to the design and operation of our information technology general controls and overall closing and financial reporting controls, including our accounting for significant and unusual transactions. We have concluded that these material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting are primarily due to the fact that we have historically operated as a private company with limited resources and had neither formally designed and implemented the necessary business processes and related internal controls nor employed personnel with the appropriate level of experience and technical expertise to oversee (i) our business processes and controls surrounding information technology general controls, (ii) our closing and financial reporting processes, or (iii) the accounting and financial reporting requirements related to significant and unusual transactions.\nAs a result of these material weaknesses, we have initiated and will continue to implement remediation measures including, but not limited to: (i) hiring additional accounting staff members to augment our current staff and to improve the effectiveness of our financial period close and reporting processes; (ii) engaging a third party to assist us in complying with the accounting and financial reporting requirements related to significant and unusual transactions; (iii) engaging a third party to assist us in identifying and implementing the business processes and controls surrounding information technology general controls; and (iv) engaging a third party to assist us with formalizing our business processes, accounting policies and internal control documentation, strengthening supervisory reviews by our management, and evaluating the effectiveness of our internal controls in accordance with the framework established by Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nIf we fail to fully remediate these material weaknesses or fail to maintain effective internal controls in the future, it could result in a material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis, which could cause investors to lose confidence in our financial information or cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to decline. Our independent registered public accounting firm has not assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and, under the JOBS Act, will not be required to provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting so long as we qualify as an emerging growth company, which may increase the risk that weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting go undetected.\nIf the price of our Class A common stock fluctuates significantly, your investment could lose value.\nPrior to our initial public offering in May 2018, there was no public market for our Class A common stock. Although our Class A common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, we cannot guarantee that an active public market will be maintained for our Class A common stock. If an active public market for our Class A common stock is not maintained, the trading price and liquidity of our Class A common stock will be materially and adversely affected. If there is a thin trading market or \u201cfloat\u201d for our Class A common stock, the market price for our Class A common stock may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market as a whole. Without a large float, our Class A common stock is less liquid than the securities of companies with broader public ownership and, as a result, the trading prices of our Class A common stock may be more volatile. In addition, in the absence of an active public trading market, investors may be unable to liquidate their investment in our Company at the times or prices they desire. In addition, the stock market is subject to significant price and volume fluctuations, and the price of our Class A common stock could fluctuate widely in response to several factors, including: our quarterly or annual operating results; investment recommendations by securities analysts following our business or our industry; additions or departures of key personnel; changes in the business, earnings estimates or market perceptions of our competitors; our failure to achieve operating results consistent with securities analysts\u2019 projections; changes in industry, general market or economic conditions; and announcements of legislative or regulatory change.\nThe stock market has experienced substantial price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have significantly affected the quoted prices of the securities of many companies, including companies in our industry. The changes often appear to occur without regard to specific operating performance. The price of our Class A common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our Company, and these fluctuations could materially reduce the price for our Class A common stock.\nFuture sales, or the perception of future sales, by us or our existing stockholders in the public market could cause the market price for our Class A common stock to decline.\nThe sale of shares of our Class A common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could harm the prevailing market price of shares of our Class A common stock. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nWe have outstanding a total of 11,950,000 shares of our Class A common stock and 39,464,619 shares of our Class B common stock that are convertible by the holders thereof at any time into an equal number of shares of our Class A common stock. Of the outstanding shares, the 11,950,000 shares sold in the initial public offering are freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), except that certain shares held by our affiliates, as that term is defined under Rule 144 of the Securities Act (\u201cRule 144\u201d), including certain of our directors, executive officers and other affiliates (including affiliates of SunTx) may be sold only in compliance with the provisions of Rule 144.\nThe 39,464,619 shares of our Class B common stock, representing 76.8% of our total outstanding shares of our common stock at December 10, 2018, are \u201crestricted securities\u201d within the meaning of Rule 144 and may be sold in the public market only if they are registered under the Securities Act or are sold pursuant to an exemption from registration such as Rule 144.\nPursuant to a registration rights agreement, SunTx and certain other stockholders have the right, subject to certain conditions, to require us to register the sale of their shares of common stock under the Securities Act. By exercising their registration rights and selling a large number of shares, these stockholders could cause the prevailing market price of our Class A common stock to decline. Shares covered by registration rights represented approximately 75.9% of our total outstanding common stock as of December 10, 2018. Registration of any of these outstanding shares of common stock would result in such shares becoming freely tradable without compliance with Rule 144 upon effectiveness of the registration statement.\nIf these stockholders exercise their registration rights, the market price of the shares of our Class A common stock could drop significantly if the holders of these shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through future offerings of our Class A common stock or other securities.\nIn the future, we may also issue our securities in connection with offerings or acquisitions. The number of shares of our Class A common stock issued in connection with offerings or acquisitions could constitute a material portion of the then-outstanding shares of our Class A common stock. Any issuance of additional securities in connection with offerings or acquisitions would result in additional dilution to holders of our Class A common stock.\nAffiliates of SunTx control us, and their interests may conflict with ours or yours in the future.\nAs of December 10, 2018, affiliates of SunTx beneficially owned 88.8% of our Class B common stock, representing 86.2% of the combined voting power of our common stock. Each share of our Class B common stock has ten votes per share, and each share of our Class A common stock has one vote per share. As a result, affiliates of SunTx have the ability to elect all of the members of our board of directors and thereby control our policies and operations, including the appointment of management, future issuances of our Class A common stock or other securities, the payment of dividends, if any, on our Class A common stock, the incurrence of debt by us, amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, and the Company's entry into extraordinary transactions. This concentration of voting control could deprive you of an opportunity to receive a premium for your shares of our Class A common stock as part of a sale of our Company and ultimately might affect the market price of our Class A common stock. In addition, we have engaged, and expect to continue to engage, in related party transactions involving SunTx and certain companies they control. As a result, the interests of affiliates of SunTx may not in all cases be aligned with your interests.\nIn addition, SunTx may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions that, in its judgment, could enhance its investment, even though such transactions might involve risks to you. For example, SunTx could cause us to make acquisitions that increase our indebtedness or cause us to sell revenue-generating assets. SunTx is in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that none of SunTx, any of its affiliates or any director who is not employed by us or his or her affiliates will have any duty to refrain from engaging, directly or indirectly, in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which we operate. SunTx also may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us.\nSo long as SunTx and its affiliates continue to beneficially own a sufficient number of shares of our Class B common stock, they will continue to be able to effectively control our decisions. For example, if our Class B common stock amounted to 15% of our outstanding common stock, holders of our Class B common stock (including SunTx and its affiliates) would collectively control approximately 63.8% of the voting power of our common stock based on the number of shares of Class A and Class B common stock outstanding at December 10, 2018. Shares of our Class B common stock may be transferred to an unrelated third party if a majority of the shares of our Class B common stock held by SunTx and its affiliates have consented to such transfer in writing in advance.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our Class A common stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, the price of our Class A common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our Company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the price or trading volume of our Class A common stock to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover our Company downgrades our Class A common stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, the price of our Class A common stock could decline.\nWe may issue preferred stock with terms that could adversely affect the voting power or value of our Class A common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights, including preferences over our Class A common stock with respect to dividends and distributions, as our board of directors may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our Class A common stock. For example, we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or upon the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our Class A common stock.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and Delaware corporate law make it more difficult to effect a change in control of our Company, which could adversely affect the price of our Class A common stock.\nCertain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and Delaware corporate law could delay or prevent a change in control of our Company, even if that change would be beneficial to our stockholders. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make acquiring control of our Company difficult, including:\n\u2022\na dual class common stock structure, which currently provides SunTx and its affiliates and the other holders of our Class B common stock with the ability to control the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, so long as they continue to beneficially own a sufficient number of shares of our Class B common stock, even if they own significantly less than 50% of the shares of our outstanding common stock;\n\u2022\na classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms;\n\u2022\nprovisions regulating the ability of our stockholders to nominate directors for election or to bring matters for action at annual meetings of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the ability of our stockholders to call a special meeting;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws, and the requirement that the affirmative vote of holders representing at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock be obtained for stockholders to amend our amended and restated bylaws;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that the affirmative vote of holders representing at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock be obtained to remove directors;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that the affirmative vote of holders representing at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock be obtained to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation; and\n\u2022\nthe authorization given to our board of directors to issue and set the terms of preferred stock without the approval of our stockholders.\nThese provisions also could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. As a result, these provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders, which may limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our Class A common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates courts in the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, subject to limited exceptions, a state court located within the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for:\n\u2022\nany derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\n\u2022\nany action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders;\n\u2022\nany action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d); or\n\u2022\nany action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nIn addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that if any action specified above (each is referred to herein as a covered proceeding), is filed in a court other than a court located within the State of Delaware (each is referred to herein as a foreign action), the claiming party will be deemed to have consented to (i) the personal jurisdiction of state and federal courts located within the State of Delaware in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce the exclusive forum provision described above and (ii) having service of process made upon such claiming party in any such enforcement action by service upon such claiming party\u2019s counsel in the foreign action as agent for such claiming party.\nThese provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the covered proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nBecause we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under the listing standards of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC and the rules of the SEC, our stockholders do not have, and may never have, certain corporate governance protections that are available to stockholders of companies that are not controlled companies.\nSunTx and its affiliates control a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. As a result, we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under the listing standards of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC and SEC rules. As a result, we are not required to comply with certain provisions requiring that (i) a majority of our directors be independent, (ii) the compensation of our executives be determined by independent directors or (iii) nominees for election to our board of directors be selected by independent directors. Because we intend to take advantage of some or all of these exemptions, our stockholders may not have the protections that these rules are intended to provide. Our status as a controlled company could cause our Class A common stock to be less attractive to certain investors or otherwise reduce the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our Class A common stock in the foreseeable future, and therefore only appreciation, if any, of the price of our Class A common stock will provide a return to our stockholders.\nWe currently anticipate that we will retain all future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. We do not intend to pay cash dividends on our Class A common stock in the foreseeable future. Any future determination as to the declaration and payment of cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our financial condition, results of operations, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. In addition, the Compass Credit Agreement restricts our ability to pay cash dividends. As a result, only appreciation of the price of our Class A common stock, which may not occur, will provide a return to our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 17801, "SIC": 1600, "TIC": "ROAD"}
