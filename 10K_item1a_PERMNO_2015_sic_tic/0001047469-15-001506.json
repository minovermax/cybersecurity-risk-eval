{"cik": "1163739", "company": "NABORS INDUSTRIES LTD", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A.-Risk Factors-Changes to or noncompliance with governmental regulation or exposure to environmental liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information set forth elsewhere in this report, the following factors should be carefully considered when evaluating Nabors. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.\nOur business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.\nRisks Related to the Business\nFluctuations in oil and natural gas prices could adversely affect drilling activity and our revenues, cash flows and profitability\nOur operations depend on the level of spending by oil and gas companies for exploration, development and production activities. Both short-term and long-term trends in oil and natural gas prices affect these levels. Oil and natural gas prices, as well as the level of drilling, exploration and production activity, can be highly volatile. For example, within the past year, oil prices have been as high as $107 per barrel and have recently been as low as $44 per barrel in 2015. Worldwide military, political and economic events, including initiatives by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, affect both the demand for, and the supply of, oil and natural gas. Weather conditions, governmental regulation (both in the United States and elsewhere), levels of consumer demand, the availability of pipeline capacity, and other factors beyond our control may also affect the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas. A prolonged period of lower oil and natural gas prices could depress the level of drilling, exploration and production activity and result in a corresponding decline in the demand for our services and/or a reduction in dayrates and utilization, which could have an adverse effect on our revenues, cash flows and profitability. Lower oil and natural gas prices have caused some of our customers to terminate, seek to renegotiate or fail to honor our drilling contracts and affected the fair market value of our rig fleet, which in turn has resulted in impairments of our assets. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded impairment charges of approximately $1.0 billion, reflecting the effect of the recent decline in oil prices on our assets. If there is a prolonged period of lower oil and natural gas prices, it could adversely impact our cash forecast models used to determine whether the carrying value of our long-lived assets exceed our future cash flows, which could result in future impairment to our long-lived assets. A prolonged period of lower oil and natural gas prices could also affect our ability to retain skilled rig personnel and affect our ability to access capital to finance and grow our business. There can be no assurances as to the future level of demand for our services or future conditions in the oil and natural gas and oilfield services industries.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry with excess drilling capacity, which may adversely affect our results of operations\nThe oilfield services industry is very competitive. Contract drilling companies compete primarily on a regional basis, and competition may vary significantly from region to region at any particular time. Most rigs and drilling-related equipment can be moved from one region to another in response to changes in levels of activity and market conditions, which may result in an oversupply of such rigs and drilling-related equipment in certain areas, and accordingly, significant price competition. In addition, in recent years, the ability to deliver rigs with new technology and features has become an important factor in determining job awards. Our customers are increasingly demanding the services of newer, higher specification drilling rigs, which requires continued technological developments and increased capital expenditures, and our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and services and changes in customer requirements for equipment. As a result of these and other competitive factors, we may be unable to maintain or increase our market share, utilization\nrates and/or prices for our services, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur drilling contracts may in certain instances be renegotiated or terminated without an early termination payment\nMost of our drilling contracts require that an early termination payment be made to us if a contract is terminated by the customer prior to its expiration. Such payments may not fully compensate us for the loss of a contract, and in certain circumstances, such as, but not limited to, destruction of a drilling rig that is not replaced within a specified period of time or other breach of our contractual obligations, the customer may not be obligated to make an early termination payment to us. During depressed market conditions or otherwise, customers may seek to terminate, renegotiate or fail to honor their contractual obligations for various reasons, including those described above. The renegotiation or termination of such contracts without an adequate early termination payment could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nThe nature of our operations presents inherent risks of loss that could adversely affect our results of operations\nOur operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the drilling, workover and well-servicing and pressure pumping industries, including blowouts, cratering, explosions, fires, loss of well control, loss of or damage to the wellbore or underground reservoir, damaged or lost drilling equipment and damage or loss from inclement weather or natural disasters. Any of these hazards could result in personal injury or death, damage to or destruction of equipment and facilities, suspension of operations, environmental and natural resources damage and damage to the property of others. Our offshore operations involve the additional hazards of marine operations including capsizing, grounding, collision, damage from hurricanes and heavy weather or sea conditions and unsound ocean bottom conditions. Our operations are also subject to risks of war, civil disturbances or other political events.\nAccidents may occur, we may be unable to obtain desired contractual indemnities, and our insurance may prove inadequate in certain cases. The occurrence of an event not fully insured or indemnified against, or the failure or inability of a customer or insurer to meet its indemnification or insurance obligations, could result in substantial losses. In addition, insurance may not be available to cover any or all of these risks. Even if available, insurance may be inadequate or insurance premiums or other costs may increase significantly in the future making insurance prohibitively expensive. We expect to continue facing upward pressure in our insurance renewals; our premiums and deductibles may be higher, and some insurance coverage may either be unavailable or more expensive than it has been in the past. Moreover, our insurance coverage generally provides that we assume a portion of the risk in the form of a deductible or self-insured retention. We may choose to increase the levels of deductibles (and thus assume a greater degree of risk) from time to time in order to minimize our overall costs.\nThe profitability of our operations could be adversely affected by war, civil disturbance, terrorist activity or other political or economic instability, fluctuation in currency exchange rates and local import and export controls\nWe derive a significant portion of our business from global markets, including major operations in Canada, South America, Mexico, the Middle East, the Far East, the South Pacific, Russia and Africa. These operations are subject to various risks, including war, civil disturbances, political or economic instability, terrorist activity and governmental actions that may limit or disrupt markets, restrict the movement of funds or result in the deprivation of contract rights or the taking of property without fair compensation. In some countries, our operations may be subject to the additional risk of fluctuating currency values and exchange controls. We are subject to various laws and regulations that govern the\noperation and taxation of our business and the import and export of our equipment from country to country, the imposition, application and interpretation of which can prove to be uncertain.\nAs a holding company, we depend on our subsidiaries to meet our financial obligations\nWe are a holding company with no significant assets other than the stock of our subsidiaries. In order to meet our financial needs, we rely exclusively on repayments of interest and principal on intercompany loans that we have made to our operating subsidiaries and income from dividends and other cash flow from our subsidiaries. There can be no assurance that our operating subsidiaries will generate sufficient net income to pay us dividends or sufficient cash flow to make payments of interest and principal to us. In addition, from time to time, our operating subsidiaries may enter into financing arrangements that contractually restrict or prohibit these types of upstream payments. There can also be adverse tax consequences associated with paying dividends.\nOur financial and operating flexibility could be affected by our long-term debt and other financial commitments\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $4.4 billion in outstanding debt. We also have various financial commitments, such as leases, firm transportation and processing, contracts and purchase commitments. Our ability to service our debt and other financial obligations depends in large part upon the level of cash flows generated by our subsidiaries' operations, our ability to monetize and/or divest non-core assets, availability under our unsecured revolving credit facility and our ability to access the capital markets.\nA downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital\nOur ability to access capital markets or to otherwise obtain sufficient financing is enhanced by our senior unsecured debt ratings as provided by the major U.S. credit rating agencies and our historical ability to access those markets as needed. Factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, planned asset purchases or sales, and near-term and long-term production growth opportunities. Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, product mix, and commodity pricing levels and others are also considered by the rating agencies. A ratings downgrade could adversely impact our ability to access debt markets in the future, increase the cost of future debt, and potentially require us to post letters of credit for certain obligations.\nThe loss of key executives or inability to attract and retain experienced technical personnel could reduce our competitiveness and harm prospects for future success\nThe successful execution of our business strategies will depend, in part, on the continued service of certain key executive officers. We have employment agreements with some of our key personnel within the company. We do not carry significant amounts of key man insurance. In addition, our operations depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced technical professionals. Competition for such professionals is intense. The loss of key executive officers and/or our inability to retain or attract experienced technical personnel, could reduce our competitiveness and harm prospects for future success, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges to or noncompliance with governmental regulation or exposure to environmental liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations\nDrilling of oil and gas wells is subject to various laws, rules and regulations in the jurisdictions where we operate. Our cost of compliance with these laws may be substantial. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") has promulgated rules requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions applicable to certain offshore oil and natural gas production and onshore oil and natural\ngas production, processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities. In addition, U.S. federal law strictly regulates the prevention of oil spills and the release of hazardous substances, and imposes liability for removal costs and natural resource, real or personal property and certain economic damages arising from any spills. Some of these laws may impose strict and/or joint and several liability for clean-up costs and damages without regard to the conduct of the parties. As an owner and operator of onshore and offshore rigs and other equipment, we may be deemed to be a responsible party under federal law. In addition, our completion and production services operations routinely involve the handling of significant amounts of materials, some of which are classified as solid or hazardous wastes or hazardous substances. We are subject to various laws governing the containment and disposal of hazardous substances, oilfield waste and other waste materials, the use of underground storage tanks and the use of underground injection wells. We employ personnel responsible for monitoring environmental compliance and arranging for remedial actions that may be required from time to time and also use consultants to advise on and assist with our environmental compliance efforts. Liabilities are recorded when the need for environmental assessments and/or remedial efforts become known or probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated.\nChanges in environmental laws may also negatively impact the operations of oil and natural gas exploration and production companies, which in turn could have an adverse effect on us. For example, legislation has been proposed from time to time in the U.S. Congress that would reclassify some oil and natural gas production wastes as hazardous wastes under the Resources Conservation and Recovery Act, which would make the reclassified wastes subject to more stringent and costly handling, disposal and clean-up requirements. In addition, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act provides the federal government with broad discretion in regulating the leasing of offshore oil and gas production sites. Legislators and regulators in the United States and other jurisdictions where we operate also focus increasingly on restricting the emission of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases that may contribute to warming of the Earth's atmosphere, and other climatic changes. The U.S. Congress has considered legislation designed to reduce emission of greenhouse gases, and some states in which we operate have passed legislation or adopted initiatives, such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative in the northeastern United States and the Western Regional Climate Action Initiative, which establish greenhouse gas inventories and/or cap-and-trade programs. Some international initiatives have also been adopted, which could result in increased costs of operations in covered jurisdictions. In addition, the EPA has published findings that emissions of greenhouse gases present an endangerment to public health and the environment, paving the way for further regulations that could restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act. The EPA has already issued rules requiring monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from oil and natural gas systems. Future or more stringent regulation could dramatically increase operating costs for oil and natural gas companies and could reduce the market for our services by making wells and/or oilfields uneconomical to operate.\nThe expansion of the scope of laws protecting the environment has accelerated in recent years, particularly outside the United States, and we expect this trend to continue. The violation of environmental laws can lead to the imposition of administrative, civil or criminal penalties, remedial obligations, and in some cases injunctive relief. Violations may also result in liabilities for personal injuries, property and natural resource damage and other costs and claims. We are not always successful in allocating all risks of these environmental liabilities to customers, and it is possible that customers who assume the risks will be financially unable to bear any resulting costs.\nChanges in environmental laws related to hydraulic fracturing or other operations could result in increased costs of compliance and reductions or delays in drilling and completing new oil and natural gas wells, which could adversely impact the demand for fracturing and other services or our results of operations\nOperations in our Completion Services operating segment include hydraulic fracturing, a process sometimes used in the completion of oil and gas wells whereby water, sand and chemicals are injected under pressure into subsurface formations to stimulate gas and, to a lesser extent, oil production. Hydraulic fracturing activities are currently exempt under the Safe Drinking Water Act (\"SDWA\"), except for such activities that use diesel fuel, for which the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over and issued permitting guidance on in February 2014. In 2012, the EPA promulgated new rules establishing new air emission controls for oil and gas production and natural gas processing operations. More recently, in May 2014, the EPA issued an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking regarding the agency's intent to develop regulations under the Toxic Substances and Control Act related to the disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. The EPA is also conducting a study of the potential environmental impacts from hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources and developing rules on effluent limitations for the treatment and discharge of wastewater resulting from hydraulic fracturing activities, both which are expected for publication in early 2015. In addition, the federal Bureau of Land Management has proposed new requirements on hydraulic fracturing conducted on federal lands, including the disclosure of chemical additives used. In 2011, the U.S. Department of Energy released a report on hydraulic fracturing, recommending the implementation of a variety of measures to reduce the environmental impacts from shale-gas production. In addition, there has been public opposition to hydraulic fracturing. As a result, there have been legislative initiatives to regulate hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act or under newly established legislation. From time to time, legislation has also been introduced in the U.S. Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA and to require the disclosure of chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. In addition, various states and local governments have implemented, or are considering, increased regulatory oversight of hydraulic fracturing through additional permit requirements, operational restrictions, disclosure requirements and temporary or permanent bans. For example, Texas has adopted legislation that requires the public disclosure of information regarding the substances used in the hydraulic fracturing process, and, on December 17, 2014, the State of New York announced a ban on hydraulic fracturing due to public health and environmental concerns identified in its several years study. In addition, municipalities in Colorado and several other states have adopted or are in the process of adopting ordinances restricting or prohibiting hydraulic fracturing within their jurisdictions. New or further changes in laws and regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or otherwise banning or limiting, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult to complete oil and natural gas wells in shale formations, cause operational delays, increase costs of regulatory compliance or in exploration and production, which could adversely affect our business and the demand for fracturing services.\nAny violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or any other similar anti-corruption laws could have a negative impact on us\nA significant portion of our revenue is derived from operations outside the United States, which exposes us to complex foreign and U.S. regulations inherent in doing cross-border business and in each of the countries in which we transact business. We are subject to compliance with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") and other similar anti-corruption laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While our employees and agents are required to comply with these laws, we cannot be sure that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws, despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics. Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties, and the SEC and U.S. Department of Justice have increased their enforcement\nactivities with respect to the FCPA. The occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may adversely affect our business, performance, prospects, value, financial condition, and results of operations.\nSignificant exercises of stock options could adversely affect the market price of our common shares\nAs of February 26, 2015, we had 800,000,000 authorized common shares, of which 329,376,998 shares were outstanding. In addition, 19,449,499 common shares were reserved for issuance pursuant to stock option and employee benefit plans. The sale, or availability for sale, of substantial amounts of our common shares in the public market, whether directly by us or resulting from the exercise of options (and, where applicable, sales pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act), would be dilutive to existing security holders, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common shares and could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities.\nProvisions in our organizational documents may be insufficient to thwart a coercive hostile takeover attempt; conversely, they may deter a change of control transaction and decrease the likelihood of a shareholder receiving a change of control premium\nCompanies generally seek to prevent coercive takeovers by parties unwilling to pay fair value for the enterprise they acquire. Historically, we have sought to avoid a coercive takeover by:\n\u2022 Classifying our Board of Directors (\"Board\") so that all the directors could not be replaced at a single meeting;\n\u2022 Authorizing the Board to issue a significant number of common shares and up to 25,000,000 preferred shares, as well as to determine the price, rights (including voting rights), conversion ratios, preferences and privileges of the preferred shares, in each case without any vote or action by the holders of our common shares;\n\u2022 Adopting a shareholder rights plan that limits the number of shares of our common stock a potential acquiror can purchase without either securing the approval of our Board or having their voting interest severely diluted. The plan is scheduled to expire in July 2016 unless it is extended;\n\u2022 Limiting the ability of our shareholders to call or bring business before special meetings;\n\u2022 Prohibiting our shareholders from taking action by written consent in lieu of a meeting unless the consent is signed by all the shareholders then entitled to vote;\n\u2022 Requiring advance notice of shareholder proposals for business to be conducted at general meetings and for nomination of candidates for election to our Board; and\n\u2022 Reserving to our Board the ability to determine the number of directors comprising the full Board and to fill vacancies or newly created seats on the Board.\nAt the request of shareholders, we declassified the Board, which makes it easier for another party to acquire control of the Company. The remaining provisions designed to avoid a coercive takeover may not be fully effective so that a party may still be able to acquire the Company without paying what the Board considers to be fair value, including a control premium. Conversely, such provisions could discourage a would-be acquiror and thus reduce the likelihood that shareholders would receive a premium for their shares in a takeover.\nWe may have additional tax liabilities\nIncome tax returns that we file will be subject to review and examination. We will not recognize the benefit of income tax positions we believe are more likely than not to be disallowed upon challenge by a tax authority. If any tax authority successfully challenges our operational structure, intercompany\npricing policies or the taxable presence of our subsidiaries in certain countries, if the terms of certain income tax treaties are interpreted in a manner that is adverse to our structure, or if we lose a material tax dispute in any country, our effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings could increase substantially and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nLegal proceedings could affect our financial condition and results of operations\nWe are subject to legal proceedings and governmental investigations from time to time that include employment, tort, intellectual property and other claims, and purported class action and shareholder derivative actions. We are also subject to complaints and allegations from former, current or prospective employees from time to time, alleging violations of employment-related laws. Lawsuits or claims could result in decisions against us that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe profitability of our operations could be adversely affected by turmoil in the global financial and commodity markets\nChanges in general financial and political conditions may negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in ways that we cannot predict. If global financial and commodity markets and economic conditions deteriorate in the future, there could be a material adverse impact on our liquidity and those of our customers and other worldwide business partners. For example, as a result of a dramatic decline in oil prices in the fourth quarter of 2014 which remained suppressed into 2015, our customers have reduced or curtailed their capital spending and drilling activities. As a result, we and our customers may experience difficulties forecasting future capital expenditures, which in turn could negatively impact the worldwide rig count and our future financial results.\nWe previously identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, and our business and stock price may be adversely affected if our internal control over financial reporting is not effective\nUnder Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules promulgated by the SEC, companies are required to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of their internal control over financial reporting. As part of this process, we are required to document and test our internal control over financial reporting; management is required to assess and issue a report concerning our internal control over financial reporting; and our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our controls over the accounting for and disclosures related to a non-routine complex legal entity restructuring in the interim consolidated financial statements. A more complete description of this material weakness is included in Item 9A, \"Controls and Procedures\" in this Form 10-K, together with our remediation plan.\nThe existence of a material weakness could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in a restatement of financial statements, which could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, lead to a loss of investor confidence and have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock.\nFailure to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic transactions may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position\nWe undertake from time to time acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic transactions, such as the proposed Merger with CJES, that we expect to further our business objectives. The anticipated benefits of such transactions may not be realized, or may be realized more slowly than expected, and may result in operational and financial consequences, including, but not limited to, the loss of key customers, suppliers or employees and significant transactional expenses, which may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.\nOur business is subject to cybersecurity risks\nThreats to information technology systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks continue to grow. Risks associated with these threats include, among other things, loss of intellectual property, disruption of our and customers' business operations and safety procedures, loss or damage to our worksite data delivery systems, and increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to mitigate our exposure to such risk, cybersecurity attacks are evolving and unpredictable. The occurrence of such an attack could go unnoticed for a period time and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Merger\nThe Merger is subject to customary approvals and conditions which may adversely impact the timing of the transaction and our ability to consummate the transaction\nIn June 2014, we and certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries, including Nabors Red Lion Limited (\"Red Lion\"), agreed to the proposed Merger with CJES. Under the amended terms of the Merger and related transactions, we expect to receive total consideration comprised of approximately $688 million in cash and approximately 62.5 million common shares in the combined company upon the closing of the Merger. The Merger is subject to customary approvals and conditions, many of which are outside of our control, including, among others, the approval of the Merger by the holders of a majority of outstanding CJES common stock and the availability of the proceeds of CJES's debt financing to effect the cash payment to us at closing. Although we expect the Merger to be completed in March of 2015 following the special meeting of CJES stockholders on March 20, 2015, we cannot assure you that the Merger will be consummated within the anticipated time period or at all, including as the result of regulatory, market or other factors. Further, any delay in the consummation of the Merger could result in additional transaction costs or other effects associated with uncertainty about the Merger, which may adversely impact our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction.\nIn addition, failure to consummate the Merger could have an adverse effect on our business for a number of reasons, including that we will have incurred significant transaction costs without achieving the anticipated benefits from the transaction, including the expected cash payment from CJES, and will have lost the opportunity to pursue other strategic transactions. In addition, the market and price for our common stock could be adversely impacted from such delay or failure.\nFollowing completion of the Merger, we will not be able to exert complete control over New C&J\nFollowing the completion of the Merger, we will own 53% of the outstanding and issued common shares of the newly combined company. While we will have the ability to exert a significant degree of influence as a substantial shareholder, we will not be able to directly manage the daily operations of the newly combined company, including our Completion & Production Services business line, and will not be able to exert complete control over the decision-making of the board of directors of the newly combined company, including with respect to cash distributions to shareholders or the transfer of assets, under normal circumstances.", "PERMNO": 29102, "SIC": 1381, "TIC": "NBR"}
