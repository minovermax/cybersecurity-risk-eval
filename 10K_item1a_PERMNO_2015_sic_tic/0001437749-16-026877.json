{"cik": "1389545", "company": "NovaBay Pharmaceuticals, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-04", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nOur business is subject to a number of risks, the most important of which are discussed below. You should consider carefully the following risks in addition to the other information contained in this report and our other filings with the SEC before deciding to buy, sell or hold our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected, the value of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Relating to Our Liquidity\nThere is uncertainty about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe have a limited number of commercial products, and these products are still in their early stage of commercialization and will require significant additional investment before we realize substantial revenue. As a result, we have incurred since our inception, and expect to continue to incur until at least the end of 2016, substantial net losses. Moreover, our cash position is inadequate to support our current business operations and substantial additional funding will be needed in order to pursue our business plan, which includes increasing market penetration for our existing commercial products, research and development for additional product offerings for the eye care market, seeking regulatory approval for these product candidates, and pursuing their commercialization in the U.S., Asia, and other markets. These circumstances raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, which depends on our ability to raise capital to fund our current operations.\nWe have a history of losses and expect that we will incur net losses in the future, and that we may never achieve or maintain sustained profitability.\nWe expect to incur substantial marketing and sales expenses as we attempt to increase sales of our Avenova product. We expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and we may never achieve or maintain sustained profitability. In addition, at this time we are subject to the following risks:\n\u25cf\nour results of operations may fluctuate significantly, which may adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock;\n\u25cf\nwe may be unable to develop and commercialize our product candidates; and\n\u25cf\nit may be difficult to forecast accurately our key operating and performance metrics because of our limited operating history.\nWe will need to generate significant revenues to achieve and maintain profitability. If we cannot successfully market and sell Avenova, either independently or with partners, we will not be able to generate sufficient revenues to achieve or maintain profitability in the future. Our failure to achieve and subsequently maintain profitability could have a material adverse impact on the market price of our common stock.\nWe may be unable to raise additional capital on acceptable terms in the future, which may in turn limit our ability to develop and commercialize products and technologies.\nWhile we have reduced our staff levels and reduced both our research and general expenditures, we believe our capital outlays and operating expenditures will outsize our expected near-term revenue. Commercializing a product is very expensive, and we expect that we will need to raise additional capital, through future private or public equity offerings, strategic alliances or debt financing, before we achieve a breakeven point between expenses and product sales. In addition, we may require even more significant capital outlays and operating expenditures if we do not continue to partner with third parties to develop and commercialize our products.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u25cf\nthe availability and willingness of capital markets to fund our planned operations;\n\u25cf\neconomic conditions out of our control;\n\u25cf\nmarket acceptance and revenue growth of Avenova;\n\u25cf\nthe extent to which we receive milestone payments or other funding from external partners, if any;\n\u25cf\nthe scope, rate of progress, cost and results of our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials and other research and development activities, if any;\n\u25cf\nthe terms and timing of any collaborative, licensing and other arrangements that we may establish;\n\u25cf\nthe cost and timing of regulatory approvals;\n\u25cf\nthe cost of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates and any products that we may develop;\n\u25cf\nthe effect of competing technological and market developments;\n\u25cf\nthe costs associated with marketing and selling Avenova and NeutroPhase;\n\u25cf\nthe cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights; and\n\u25cf\nthe extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses, products and technologies, although we currently have no commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions.\nAdditional financing may not be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. The securities rules and regulations limit our sale of securities registered on a Form S-3 to one-third of the aggregate market value of our outstanding common equity held by non-affiliates (the \u201cAggregate Market Value\u201d) during a 12-month period as long as our Aggregate Market Value is below $75 million. In our October 2015 public offering of common stock and accompanying warrants to purchase common stock, we utilized substantially all of our remaining capacity to sell securities on Form S-3 at the time and we currently have no capacity to sell additional securities on Form S-3. Until our Aggregate Market Value reaches $75 million, our ability to raise capital on Form S-3 is limited, especially during the period through October 2016. As a result, we may have to raise capital on a Form S-1 registration statement, which requires more disclosure than the Form S-3, would cause additional legal and other expenses, and could delay the timing of any future offerings. Even after October 2016, we may not be able to raise the amount of capital we need on a Form S-3 if our low Aggregate Market Value persists.\nIn connection with our bridge loan financing completed in January 2016, we granted China Kington Asset Management Co. Ltd. (\u201cChina Kington\u201d) a first right of refusal to lead our financings for a period that is the shorter of two years after the bridge loan financing or until our net cash flow has been no less than $0 for three consecutive months. Such financings must be unanimously approved by our Board of Directors, which includes two members nominated by China Kington pursuant to the bridge loan arrangement, until the bridge loan is paid off. As a result of these restrictions, we might not be able to obtain additional capital we need, or on the most favorable terms. Even if we are able to obtain such capital, the proceeds must be used to repay the bridge loan first before being used for our business.\nOur ability to obtain additional financing may also be negatively affected by the recent volatility in the financial markets, as well as the general downturn in the economy and decreased consumer confidence. Even if we succeed in selling additional securities to raise funds, our existing stockholders\u2019 ownership percentage would be diluted and new investors may demand rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders. In addition, if in the future we sell, or grant options or rights to purchase, our common stock at an effective price per share less than the subsequently adjusted exercise price of our warrants originally issued in July 2011, March 2015 and October 2015, the exercise price of these warrants will be reduced to equal such lower price, subject to certain exemptions as provided in the warrants. The exercise price of such warrants is currently set at $1.81 as a result of the Company\u2019s February 2016 private placement offering. See \u201c-If we conduct offerings in the future, the price at which we offer our securities is likely to trigger a price protection provision included in warrants originally issued in July 2011, March 2015 and October 2015, reducing the probability and magnitude of any future share price appreciation.\u201d\nIf we raise additional capital through strategic alliance and licensing arrangements, we may have to trade our rights to our technology, intellectual property or products to others on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, the financing may involve covenants that restrict our business activities.\nRisks Relating to Owning Our Common Stock\nIf our stockholders\u2019 equity does not meet the minimum standards of the NYSE MKT, we may be subject to delisting procedures.\nOn April 28, 2015, we received a letter from the NYSE MKT notifying us that our stockholders' equity as of December 31, 2014 was below the minimum requirements of Sections 1003(a)(ii) and (iii) of the NYSE MKT Company Guide. In order to maintain our listing, we submitted a plan of compliance, addressing how we intend to regain compliance with the Company Guide within 18 months, or by November 28, 2016. We continue our listing but will be subject to periodic reviews by the exchange. If we do not make progress consistent with the plan, the exchange will initiate delisting procedures, as appropriate.\nWe are pursuing options to address the stockholders\u2019 equity deficiency as indicated in our plan submitted to the NYSE MKT. However, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to comply with the listing requirements, and therefore our common stock may be subject to delisting. If our common stock is delisted, this could, among other things, substantially impair our ability to raise additional funds; result in a loss of institutional investor interest and fewer financing opportunities for us; and/or result in potential breaches of representations or covenants of our warrants, subscription agreements or other agreements pursuant to which we made representations or covenants relating to our compliance with applicable listing requirements. Claims related to any such breaches, with or without merit, could result in costly litigation, significant liabilities and diversion of our management's time and attention and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, business and results of operations.\nIf we conduct offerings in the future, the price at which we offer our securities is likely to trigger a price protection provision included in warrants originally issued in July 2011, March 2015 and October 2015, reducing the probability and magnitude of any future share price appreciation.\nAs part of our October 2015 offering, we agreed to amend certain terms of the warrants we previously issued in July 2011 and March 2015 to certain investors. As a result, in four different sets of warrants issued in July 2011, March 2015 and October 2015, we agreed to provide certain price protections affecting warrants exercisable for an aggregate of 1,317,227 shares of our common stock, of which 874,425 shares must be issued, if at all, by March 6, 2020, and 442,802 shares must be issued, if at all, by October 27, 2020. Specifically, in the event that we undertake a third-party equity financing of either: (1) common stock at a sale price of less than $5.00 per share; or (2) convertible securities with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, we have agreed to reduce the exercise price of all warrants discussed hereof to such lower price. As a result, if any future offering is conducted at a common stock price or warrant exercise price under $5.00 per share (as adjusted for any reverse stock split or similar transaction), these price protections will be triggered. The exercise price of such warrants is currently set at $1.81 as a result of the Company\u2019s February 2016 private placement offering. The further reduction of the exercise price for the warrants discussed hereto would limit the probability and magnitude of future share price appreciation, if any, by placing downward pressure on our stock price if it exceeds such offering sale price. All of these warrants are currently exercisable and will remain so after any exercise price adjustment. In the past, we have extended the expiration dates or adjusted other terms of previously-issued warrants as consideration for certain offering conditions, and we cannot assure you that we will not do so in the future. Any such modifications would reduce the probability and magnitude of any share price appreciation during the period of the extension. We cannot guarantee that you will receive a return on your investment when you do sell your shares or that you will not lose the entire amount of your investment. If you do receive a return on your investment, it may be lower than the return you would have realized in the absence of the price protection provisions discussed hereof.\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially, which may result in losses to our stockholders.\nThe stock prices of many companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry have generally experienced wide fluctuations, which are often unrelated to the operating performance of those companies. The market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could fluctuate in response to, among other things:\n\u25cf\nsuccessful shifting in strategy to focus on the eye care market;\n\u25cf\nthe announcement of new products by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nthe announcement of partnering arrangements by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nquarterly variations in our or our competitors\u2019 results of operations;\n\u25cf\nannouncements by us related to litigation;\n\u25cf\nchanges in our earnings estimates, investors\u2019 perceptions, recommendations by securities analysts or our failure to achieve analysts\u2019 earnings estimates;\n\u25cf\ndevelopments in our industry; and\n\u25cf\ngeneral, economic and market conditions, including the recent volatility in the financial markets and decrease in consumer confidence and other factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors.\nThe volume of trading of our common stock may be low, leaving our common stock open to the risk of high volatility.\nThe number of shares of our common stock being traded may be very low. Any stockholder wishing to sell his/her stock may cause a significant fluctuation in the price of our stock. We have a number of large stockholders, including our principal stockholder Pioneer. The sale of a substantial number of shares of common stock by such large stockholders within a short period of time could cause our stock price to decrease substantially. In addition, low trading volume of a stock increases the possibility that, despite rules against such activity, the price of the stock may be manipulated by persons acting in their own self-interest. We may not have adequate market makers and market making activity to prevent manipulation.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage a third party from making a takeover offer that is beneficial to our stockholders.\nAnti-takeover provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law may have the effect of deterring or delaying attempts by our stockholders to remove or replace management, engage in proxy contests and effect changes in control. The provisions of our charter documents include:\n\u25cf\na classified board so that only one of the three classes of directors on our Board of Directors is elected each year;\n\u25cf\nelimination of cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u25cf\nprocedures for advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals;\n\u25cf\nthe ability of our Board of Directors to amend our bylaws without stockholder approval; and\n\u25cf\nthe ability of our Board of Directors to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval upon the terms and conditions and with the rights, privileges and preferences as our Board of Directors may determine.\nIn addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to the Delaware General Corporation Law, which includes provisions that may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in control or management of our Company. Provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock by discouraging a hostile bid, or delaying, preventing or deterring a merger, acquisition or tender offer in which our stockholders could receive a premium for their shares, or effect a proxy contest for control of NovaBay or other changes in our management.\nWe have not paid dividends in the past and do not expect to pay dividends in the future, and any return on investment may be limited to the value of our stock.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends on our common stock will depend on our earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting us at such time as our Board of Directors may consider relevant. If we do not pay dividends, you will experience a return on your investment in our shares only if our stock price appreciates. We cannot assure you that you will receive a return on your investment when you do sell your shares or that you will not lose the entire amount of your investment.\nPioneer and China Kington might influence our corporate matters in a manner that is not in the best interest of our general stockholders.\nAs of February 29, 2016, Pioneer beneficially owns approximately 22% of our common stock. Our director Mr. Xinzhou \u201cPaul\u201d Li is the chief executive officer and chairman of Pioneer. Pursuant to the arrangement of our bridge loan financing completed in January 2016, two of our directors were nominated by China Kington, including Mr. Mijia \u201cBob\u201d Wu, who is the Managing Director of China Kington and Non-Executive Director of Pioneer, and Mr. Xiaoyan \u201cHenry\u201d Liu, who has worked closely with China Kington on other financial transactions in the past.\nAs a result, Pioneer and China Kington have input on all matters before our Board of Directors and may be able to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring board and stockholder approval. In particular, under our bridge loan arrangement, for a period that is the shorter of two years after the bridge loan financing or until our net cash flow has been no less than $0 for three consecutive months, our financings must be unanimously approved by our Board of Directors, which provides Pioneer and China Kington a veto right over such financings. See \u201cWe may be unable to raise additional capital on acceptable terms in the future, which may in turn limit our ability to develop and commercialize products and technologies.\u201d Pioneer and China Kington may choose to exercise their influence in a manner that is not in the best interest of our general stockholders.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change income may be limited. Since the Company\u2019s formation, the Company has raised capital through the issuance of capital stock on several occasions which, combined with the purchasing shareholders\u2019 subsequent disposition of those shares, may have resulted in one or more changes of control, as defined by Section 382. The Company has not currently completed a study to assess whether any change of control has occurred, or whether there have been multiple changes of control since the Company\u2019s formation, due to the significant complexity and cost associated with the study. If the Company has experienced a change of control at any time since its formation, its NOL carryforwards and tax credits may not be available, or their utilization could be subject to an annual limitation under Section 382. In addition, since we will need to raise substantial additional funding to finance our operations, we may undergo further ownership changes in the future. In the future, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards to offset United States federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nOur future success is largely dependent on the successful commercialization of Avenova.\nThe future success of our business is largely dependent upon the successful commercialization of Avenova. We are dedicating a substantial amount of our resources to advance Avenova as aggressively as possible. If we encounter difficulties in the commercialization of Avenova, we will not have the resources necessary to continue our business in its current form. If we are unable to establish and maintain adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or enter into or maintain agreements with third parties to do so, we may be unable to successfully commercialize our products. We believe we are creating an efficient commercial organization, taking advantage of outsourcing options where prudent to maximize the effectiveness of our commercial expenditures. However, we may not be able to correctly judge the size and experience of the sales and marketing force and the scale of distribution necessary to be successful. Establishing and maintaining sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities are expensive and time-consuming. Such expenses may be disproportionate compared to the revenues we may be able to generate on sales of Avenova.\nOur commercialized products are not approved by the FDA as a drug, so we rely solely on the 510(k) clearance of Neutrox as a medical device.\nOur business and future growth depend on the development, use and sale of products that are subject to FDA regulation, clearance and approval. Under the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and other laws, we are prohibited from promoting our products for off-label uses. This means that we may not make claims about the safety or effectiveness of our products and may not proactively discuss or provide information on the use of our products, except as allowed by the FDA. As a medical device, our claims regarding efficacy are limited. Without claims of efficacy, market acceptance of our products may be slow.\nWe may be subject to fines, penalties, injunctions and other sanctions if we are deemed to be promoting the use of our products for non-FDA-approved, or off-label, uses.\nThere is a risk that the FDA or other federal or state law enforcement authorities could determine that the nature and scope of our sales and marketing activities may constitute the promotion of our products for a non-FDA-approved use in violation of applicable law. We also face the risk that the FDA or other regulatory authorities might pursue enforcement based on past activities that we have discontinued or changed, including sales activities, arrangements with institutions and doctors, educational and training programs and other activities.\nGovernment investigations concerning the promotion of off-label uses and related issues are typically expensive, disruptive and burdensome and generate negative publicity. If our promotional activities are found to be in violation of applicable law or if we agree to a settlement in connection with an enforcement action, we would likely face significant fines and penalties and be required to substantially change our sales, promotion, grant and educational activities. In addition, were any enforcement actions against us or our senior officers to arise, we could be excluded from participation in U.S. government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.\nWe do not have our own manufacturing capacity, and we rely on partnering arrangements or third-party manufacturers for the manufacture of our products and potential products.\nWe do not currently operate manufacturing facilities for production of our product and product candidates. We have no experience in product formulation or manufacturing, and we lack the resources and the capabilities to manufacture any of our product candidates on a clinical or commercial scale. As a result, we have partnered and expect to partner with third parties to manufacture our products or rely on contract manufacturers to supply, store and distribute product supplies for our clinical trials. Any performance failure on the part of our commercial partners or future manufacturers could delay clinical development or regulatory approval of our product candidates or commercialization of our products, producing additional losses and reducing or delaying product revenues.\nOur products and product candidates will require precise, high-quality manufacturing. The failure to achieve and maintain high manufacturing standards, including the incidence of manufacturing errors, could result in patient injury or death, product recalls or withdrawals, delays or failures in product testing or delivery, cost overruns or other problems that could seriously harm our business. Contract manufacturers and partners often encounter difficulties involving production yields, quality control and quality assurance, as well as shortages of qualified personnel. These manufacturers and partners are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA and corresponding state agencies to ensure strict compliance with Quality Systems Regulations, current Good Manufacturing Practice and other applicable government regulations and corresponding foreign standards; however, we do not have control over third-party compliance with these regulations and standards. If any of our manufacturers or partners fails to maintain compliance, the production of our products could be interrupted, resulting in delays, additional costs and potentially lost revenues.\nIn addition, if the FDA or other regulatory agencies approve any of our product candidates for commercial sale, we will need to manufacture them in larger quantities. Significant scale-up of manufacturing will require validation studies, which the FDA must review and approve. If we are unable to successfully increase the manufacturing capacity for a product, the regulatory approval or commercial launch of any products may be delayed or there may be a shortage in supply and our business may be harmed as a result.\nWe depend on skilled and experienced personnel and management leadership to operate our business effectively and maintain our investor relationships. If we are unable to retain, recruit and hire such key employees, especially our next President and CEO, our ability to manage our business will be harmed, which would impair our future revenue and profitability. Creating a reliable revenue stream depends on our ability to manage an effective staff.\nOur success largely depends on the skills, experience and efforts of our officers and other key employees. The efforts of our officers and other key employees are critical to us as we continue to focus on the commercialization of our Avenova product with the goal of achieving positive cash flow from operations by the end of 2016. Any of our officers and other key employees may terminate their employment at any time, and the loss of any of our senior management team members could disrupt our business and affect key partnerships.\nRecently, on November 18, 2015, our former President and CEO, Dr. Ramin \u201cRon\u201d Najafi, resigned from NovaBay and our Chairman of the Board, Mark M. Sieczkarek, was appointed as Interim President and CEO. We do not intend to retain Mr. Sieczkarek in a long-term executive capacity, and his employment agreement expires on March 31, 2016, with three-month renewal periods that cannot be extended beyond November 18, 2016 by its terms. If we fail to identify, attract and hire a strong candidate to serve as our next President and CEO, or if we are unable to manage the transition to a new President and CEO, our ability to manage our business will be harmed. The execution of our business strategy, and thus our future revenue and profitability, depends on our ability to successfully manage this transition.\nWe intend to rely on a limited number of pharmaceutical wholesalers to distribute Avenova.\nWe intend to rely primarily upon pharmaceutical wholesalers in connection with the distribution of Avenova. If we are unable to establish or maintain our business relationships with these pharmaceutical wholesalers on commercially acceptable terms, it could have a material adverse effect on our sales and may prevent us from achieving profitability.\nIf we grow and fail to manage our growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan.\nOur future growth, if any, may cause a significant strain on our management and our operational, financial and other resources. Our ability to grow and manage our growth effectively will require us to implement and improve our operational, financial and management information systems and to expand, train, manage and motivate our employees. These demands may require the hiring of additional management personnel and the development of additional expertise by management. Any increase in resources devoted to research and product development without a corresponding increase in our operational, financial and management information systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nGovernment agencies may establish usage guidelines that directly apply to our products or proposed products or change legislation or regulations to which we are subject.\nGovernment usage guidelines typically address matters such as usage and dose, among other factors. Application of these guidelines could limit the use of our products and products that we may develop. In addition, there can be no assurance that government regulations applicable to our products or proposed products or the interpretation thereof will not change and thereby prevent the marketing of some or all of our products for a period of time or permanently. The FDA\u2019s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could modify, prevent or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the U.S. or in other countries.\nWe and our collaborators are and will be subject to ongoing FDA obligations and continued regulatory review, such as continued safety reporting requirements, and we and our collaborators may also be subject to additional FDA post-marketing obligations or new regulations, all of which may result in significant expense and which may limit our ability to commercialize our medical devices and drug products and candidates.\nAny regulatory approvals that we receive may also be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing follow-up studies. The FDA may require us to commit to perform lengthy post marketing studies, which would require us to expend additional resources and thus could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. In addition, if the FDA approves any of our drug product candidates, the labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and record keeping for the drug will be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. The subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with the drugs, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, may result in restrictions on the marketing of the drugs or the withdrawal of the drugs from the market. If we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. Any of these events could prevent us from marketing any products we may develop and our business could suffer.\nOur past clinical trials may expose us to expensive liability claims, and we may not be able to maintain liability insurance on reasonable terms or at all.\nEven though we have concluded all our clinical trials, an inherent risk remains. If a claim were to arise in the future based on our past clinical trial activity, we would most likely incur substantial expenses. Our inability to obtain sufficient clinical trial insurance at an acceptable cost to protect us against potential clinical trial claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of our product candidates. Our current clinical trial insurance covers individual and aggregate claims up to $5.0 million. This insurance may not cover all claims and we may not be able to obtain additional insurance coverage at a reasonable cost, if at all, in the future. In addition, if our agreements with any future corporate collaborators entitle us to indemnification against product liability losses and clinical trial liability, such indemnification may not be available or adequate should any claim arise.\nThe pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries are characterized by patent litigation, and any litigation or claim against us may impose substantial costs on us, place a significant strain on our financial resources, divert the attention of management from our business and harm our reputation.\nThere has been substantial litigation in the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries with respect to the manufacture, use and sale of new products that are the subject of conflicting patent rights. For the most part, these lawsuits relate to the validity, enforceability and infringement of patents. Generic companies are encouraged to challenge the patents of pharmaceutical products in the United States because a successful challenger can obtain six months of exclusivity as a generic product under the Hatch-Waxman Act. We expect that we will rely upon patents, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position, and we may initiate claims to defend our intellectual property rights as a result. Other parties may have issued patents or be issued patents that may prevent the sale of our products or know-how or require us to license such patents and pay significant fees or royalties to produce our products. In addition, future patents may be issued to third parties which our technology may infringe. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be applications now pending of which we are unaware that may later result in issued patents that our products may infringe.\nIntellectual property litigation, regardless of outcome, is expensive and time-consuming, would divert management\u2019s attention from our business and could have a material negative effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. If such a dispute were to be resolved against us, we might be required to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorney\u2019s fees if we were found to have willfully infringed a third party\u2019s patent, to the party claiming infringement, to develop non-infringing technology, to stop selling any products we develop, to cease using technology that contains the allegedly infringing intellectual property or to enter into royalty or license agreements that may not be available on acceptable or commercially practical terms, if at all. Our failure to develop non-infringing technologies or license the proprietary rights on a timely basis could harm our business. Modification of any products we develop or development of new products thereafter could require us to conduct additional clinical trials and to revise our filings with the FDA and other regulatory bodies, which would be time-consuming and expensive. In addition, parties making infringement claims may be able to obtain an injunction that would prevent us from selling any products we develop, which could harm our business.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, they could result in costly litigation and significant liabilities.\nDespite all reasonable efforts to ensure safety, it is possible that we or our collaborators will sell products, including Avenova, NeutroPhase, and intelli-Case, which are defective, to which patients react in an unexpected manner, or which are alleged to have side effects. The manufacture and sale of such products may expose us to potential liability, and the industries in which our products are likely to be sold have been subject to significant product liability litigation. Any claims, with or without merit, could result in costly litigation, reduced sales, significant liabilities and diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, business and results of operations.\nIf a product liability claim is brought against us, we may be required to pay legal and other expenses to defend the claim and, if the claim is successful, damage awards may not be covered, in whole or in part, by our insurance. We may not have sufficient capital resources to pay a judgment, in which case our creditors could levy against our assets. We may also be obligated to indemnify our collaborators and make payments to other parties with respect to product liability damages and claims. Defending any product liability claims, or indemnifying others against those claims, could require us to expend significant financial and managerial resources.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our competitors could develop and market products similar to ours that may reduce demand for our products.\nOur success, competitive position and potential future revenues will depend in significant part on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely on the patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws of the U.S. and other countries, as well as confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements, to protect our intellectual property rights. We apply for patents covering our technologies as we deem appropriate.\nThere is no assurance that any patents issued to us or licensed or assigned to us by third parties will not be challenged, invalidated, found unenforceable or circumvented, or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to us. If we or our collaborators or licensors fail to file, prosecute or maintain certain patents, our competitors could market products that contain features and clinical benefits similar to those of any products we develop, and demand for our products could decline as a result. Further, although we have taken steps to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology, third parties may be able to design around our patents or, if they do infringe upon our technology, we may not be successful or have sufficient resources in pursuing a claim of infringement against those third parties. Any pursuit of an infringement claim by us may involve substantial expense and diversion of management attention.\nWe also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how that we seek to protect by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and collaborators. If these agreements are not enforceable, or are breached, we may not have adequate remedies for any breach, and our trade secrets and proprietary know-how may become known or be independently discovered by competitors.\nWe operate in the State of California. The laws of the State prevent us from imposing a delay before an employee who may have access to trade secrets and proprietary know-how can commence employment with a competing company. Although we may be able to pursue legal action against competitive companies improperly using our proprietary information, we may not be aware of any use of our trade secrets and proprietary know-how until after significant damage has been done to our company.\nFurthermore, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. If our intellectual property does not provide significant protection against foreign or domestic competition, our competitors, including generic manufacturers, could compete more directly with us, which could result in a decrease in our market share. All of these factors may harm our competitive position.\nA default under the terms of our recent bridge loan could result in the loss of our intellectual property, including intellectual property related to Avenova.\nAs partial collateral for the approximately $3.0 million bridge loan we obtained in December 2015 and January 2016, we granted China Kington, as collateral agent, a lien on all of our intellectual property. If we default on the bridge loan, including by failing to make any payment due pursuant to the loan, China Kington would have the right to foreclose on our intellectual property. We cannot successfully commercialize Avenova without control of the related intellectual property portfolio. A loss of such intellectual property would prevent us from executing our current business strategy, which is essential to our efforts to achieve profitability. For further information regarding the possible risks if we fail to commercialize Avenova, please see the risk factor entitled \u201cOur future success is largely dependent on the successful commercialization of Avenova.\u201d\nOur current patent portfolio could leave us vulnerable to larger companies who have the resources to develop and market competing products.\nWe aggressively protect and enforce our patent rights worldwide. However, certain risks remain. There is no assurance that patents will issue from any of our applications or, for those patents we have or that do issue, that the claims will be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary rights, or that it will be economically possible to pursue sufficient numbers of patents to afford significant protection. For example, we do not have any composition of matter patent directed to the Neutrox (hypochlorous acid) composition. This relatively weak patent portfolio leaves us vulnerable to competitors who wish to compete in the same marketplace with similar products. If a potential competitor introduces a formulation similar to Avenova or NeutroPhase with a similar composition that does not fall within the scope of the method of treatment/manufacture claims, then we or a potential marketing partner would be unable to rely on the allowed claims to protect its market position for the method of using the Avenova or NeutroPhase composition, and any revenues arising from such protection would be adversely impacted.\nIf physicians and patients do not accept and use our products, we will not achieve sufficient product revenues and our business will suffer.\nEven if the FDA has cleared or approves product candidates that we develop, physicians and patients may not accept and use them. Acceptance and use of our products may depend on a number of factors including:\n\u25cf\nperceptions by members of the healthcare community, including physicians, about the safety and effectiveness of our products;\n\u25cf\npublished studies demonstrating the cost-effectiveness of our products relative to competing products;\n\u25cf\navailability of reimbursement for our products from government or healthcare payers; and\n\u25cf\neffectiveness of marketing and distribution efforts by us and our licensees and distributors, if any.\nThe failure of any of our products to find market acceptance would harm our business and could require us to seek additional financing.\nIf we cannot compete successfully for market share against other companies, we may not achieve sufficient product revenues and our business will suffer.\nThe market for our products and product candidates is characterized by intense competition and rapid technological advances. Existing or future competing products may provide greater therapeutic convenience or clinical or other benefits for a specific indication than our products, or may offer comparable performance at a lower cost. If our products are unable to capture and maintain market share, we may not achieve sufficient product revenues and our business will suffer.\nWe compete for market share against fully-integrated pharmaceutical and medical device companies or other companies that develop products independently or collaborate with larger pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations. In addition, many of these competitors, either alone or together with their collaborative partners, have substantially greater capital resources, larger research and development staffs and facilities, and greater financial resources than we do, as well as significantly greater experience in:\n\u25cf\ndeveloping drugs and devices;\n\u25cf\nconducting preclinical testing and human clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nobtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of product candidates;\n\u25cf\nformulating and manufacturing products; and\n\u25cf\nlaunching, marketing, distributing and selling products.\nOur competitors may:\n\u25cf\ndevelop and patent processes or products earlier than we will;\n\u25cf\ndevelop and commercialize products that are less expensive or more efficient than any products that we may develop;\n\u25cf\nobtain regulatory approvals for competing products more rapidly than we will; and\n\u25cf\nimprove upon existing technological approaches or develop new or different approaches that render any technology or products we develop obsolete or uncompetitive.\nWe cannot assure you that our competitors will not succeed in developing technologies and products that are more effective than any developed by us or that would render our technologies and any products we develop obsolete. If we are unable to compete successfully against current or future competitors, we may be unable to obtain market acceptance for any product candidates we create, which could prevent us from generating revenues or achieving profitability and could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nOur ability to generate revenues from our current products and any products we develop will be diminished if we fail to obtain acceptable prices or an adequate level of reimbursement for our products from healthcare payers.\nSignificant uncertainty exists as to the cost and reimbursement status of newly-approved healthcare products. Healthcare payers, including Medicare, are challenging the prices charged for medical products and/or are seeking pharmacoeconomic data to justify formulary acceptance and reimbursement practices. We currently have not generated pharmacoeconomic data on any of our products. If customers and insurance companies are not willing to pay the set price for our products, our revenue will be limited.", "PERMNO": 92345, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "NBY"}
