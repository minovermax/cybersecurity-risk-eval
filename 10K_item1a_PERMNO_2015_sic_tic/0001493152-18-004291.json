{"cik": "946644", "company": "HEMISPHERX BIOPHARMA INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-30", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A: Risk Factors\nThe following cautionary statements identify important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements made in this Form 10-K. Among the key factors that have a direct bearing on our results of operations are:\nRisks Associated with Our Business\nNo assurance of successful product development and finding co-development partners.\nAmpligen\u00ae and related products. The development of Ampligen\u00ae and our other related products is subject to a number of significant risks. Ampligen\u00ae may be found to be ineffective or to have adverse side effects, fail to receive necessary regulatory clearances, be difficult to manufacture on a commercial scale, be uneconomical to market or be precluded from commercialization by proprietary right of third parties. Our investigational products are in various stages of clinical and pre-clinical development and require further clinical studies and appropriate regulatory approval processes before any such products can be marketed. We do not know when, if ever, Ampligen\u00ae or our other products will be generally available for commercial sale for any indication. Generally, only a small percentage of potential therapeutic products are eventually approved by the FDA for commercial sale (Please see the next Risk Factor and Part 1, Item I: \u201cBusiness; Our Products; Ampligen\u00ae\u201d for more information).\nAlferon N Injection\u00ae. Although Alferon N Injection\u00ae is approved for marketing in the United States for the intralesional treatment of refractory or recurring external genital warts in patients 18 years of age or older, to date it has not been approved for other indications. We face many of the risks discussed above, with regard to developing this product for use to treat other ailments (Please see the next Risk Factor and Part 1, Item I: \u201cBusiness; Our Products; Alferon N Injection\u00ae\u201d above for more information).\nWe are committed to a focused business plan oriented toward finding co-development partners with the necessary capital and expertise required to commercialize the many therapeutic aspects of our experimental drugs and our FDA approved drug Alferon\u00ae N. If we are unable to find a suitable co-development partner to assist in the product development and commercialization of our experimental drugs and our FDA approved drug Alferon\u00ae N, we may be unable to continue or complete our development and commercialization of our products. In addition, there can be no assurance that such co-development partnerships would be on acceptable terms, or that such partnerships, will be acceptable from a profitability standpoint.\nOur drug and related technologies are investigational and subject to regulatory approval. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approval in a timely manner, or at all, our operations will be materially harmed and our stock adversely affected.\nAll of our drugs and associated technologies, other than Alferon N Injection\u00ae, are investigational in the U.S. and must receive prior regulatory approval by appropriate regulatory authorities for commercial distribution and sale and are currently legally available only through clinical trials in the U.S. with specified disorders. At present, Alferon N Injection\u00ae is approved for the intralesional treatment of refractory or recurring external genital warts in patients 18 years of age or older. Use of Alferon N Injection\u00ae for other indications will require regulatory approval in the U.S. and abroad.\nOur products, including Ampligen\u00ae, are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries, including, but not limited to, the FDA in the U.S., the Health Protection Branch (\u201cHPB\u201d) of Canada, the Agency for the European Medicines Agency (\u201cEMA\u201d) in Europe and the AdministracionNacional de Medicamentos, Alimentos y TecnologiaMedica (\u201cANMAT\u201d) in Argentina. Obtaining regulatory approvals is a rigorous and lengthy process and requires the expenditure of substantial resources. In order to obtain final regulatory approval of a new drug, we must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the regulatory agency that the product is safe and effective for its intended uses and that we are capable of manufacturing the product to the applicable regulatory standards. We require regulatory approval in order to market Ampligen\u00ae or any other proposed product and receive product revenues or royalties. We cannot assure you that Ampligen\u00ae will ultimately be demonstrated to be safe and efficacious. While Ampligen\u00ae is authorized for use in clinical trials in the U.S., we cannot assure you that additional clinical trial approvals will be authorized in the United States or in other countries, in a timely fashion or at all, or that we will complete these clinical trials. In addition, although Ampligen\u00ae has been authorized by the FDA for treatment use under certain conditions, including provision for cost recovery, there can be no assurance that such authorization will continue in effect.\nWhile we received approval of our Argentinian NDA from ANMAT for commercial sale of rintatolimod (U.S. tradename: Ampligen\u00ae) in the Argentine Republic for the treatment of severe ME/CFS, ANMAT approval is only an initial, but important, step in the overall successful commercialization of our product. There are a number of actions that must occur before we would be able to commence commercial sales in Argentina.\nOn February 1, 2013, we received a CRL from the FDA for our Ampligen\u00ae NDA for the treatment of CFS. The FDA communicated that we should conduct at least one additional clinical trial, complete various nonclinical studies and perform a number of data analysis. For more detailed information about the current status of our Ampligen\u00ae NDA please see Part 1, Item I: \u201cBusiness; Our Products; Ampligen\u00ae\u201d above.\nThe FDA\u2019s regulatory review and approval process is extensive, lengthy, expensive and inherently uncertain. To receive approval for a product candidate, we must, among other things, demonstrate to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction with substantial evidence from well-controlled pre-clinical and clinical trials that the product candidate is both safe and effective for each indication for which approval is sought. Before we can sell Ampligen\u00ae for any use, or promote Alferon\u00ae for any use other than as Alferon N Injection\u00ae for treatment of refractory or recurring genital warts, we will need to file the appropriate NDA with the FDA in the U.S. and the appropriate regulatory agency outside of the U.S. where we intend to market and sell such products. At present the only NDA we have filed with the FDA is the NDA for the use of Ampligen\u00ae to treat CFS. As discussed in the prior paragraph, the FDA issued a CRL for this NDA and indicated that we needed to conduct additional work. Therefore, ultimate FDA approval, if any, may be delayed by several years and may require us to expend more resources than we have available. It is also possible that additional studies, if performed and completed, may not be successful or considered sufficient by the FDA for approval or even to make our applications approvable. If any of these outcomes occur, we may be forced to abandon one or more of our future applications for approval, which might significantly harm our business and prospects. As a result, we cannot predict if or when we might receive regulatory approval for the use of Ampligen\u00ae to treat CFS or for the use of any other products. Even if regulatory approval from the FDA is received for the use of Ampligen\u00ae to treat CFS or eventually, for the use of any other product, any approvals that we obtain could contain significant limitations in the form of narrow indications, patient populations, warnings, precautions or contra-indications or other conditions of use, or the requirement that we implement a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy. In such an event, our ability to generate revenues from such products could be greatly reduced and our business could be harmed.\nEven if we believe that data collected from our preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidate are promising, this data has not been, and may not be in the future, sufficient to support marketing approval by the FDA, and regulatory interpretation of these data and procedures may continue to be unfavorable.\nTo the extent that we are required by the FDA, pursuant to the Ampligen\u00ae NDA, to conduct additional studies and take additional actions, approval of any applications that we submit may be delayed by several years, or may require us to expend more resources than we have available. It is also possible that additional studies, if performed and completed, may not be successful or considered sufficient by the FDA for approval or even to make our applications approvable. If any of these outcomes occur, we may be forced to abandon one or more of our future applications for approval, which might significantly harm our business and prospects. As a result, we cannot predict when or whether regulatory approval will be obtained for any product candidate we develop.\nObtaining approval of a NDA by the FDA, or a comparable foreign regulatory authority, is inherently uncertain. Even after completing clinical trials and other studies, a product candidate could fail to receive regulatory approval for many reasons, including the following:\n\u25cf not be able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA that our product candidate is safe and effective for any indication;\n\u25cf the FDA may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials or other studies;\n\u25cf the results of the clinical trials or other studies may not demonstrate that a product candidate\u2019s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;\n\u25cf the FDA may disagree with our interpretation of data from clinical trials or other studies;\n\u25cf the data collected from clinical trials and other studies of a product candidate may not be sufficient to support the submission of a NDA;\n\u25cf the approval policies or regulations of the FDA may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical and other study data insufficient for approval; and\n\u25cf the FDA may not approve the proposed manufacturing processes and facilities for a product candidate.\nIn 2012, FDA reviewers raised certain questions about the status of our existing lots of older Work-In-Process Alferon\u00ae materials and Alferon\u00ae Active Pharmaceutical Product (\u201cAPI\u201d), which would need to be released by the FDA before those materials could be used in commercial product. After conducting all of the appropriate tests on samples of the inventory during 2013, we concluded that we could not alleviate certain questions the FDA had about the older Work-In-Process Alferon N Injection\u00ae. Accordingly, these lots were not submitted to the FDA to request release for commercial sale and their remaining dollar value was written-off. In the absence of FDA approvals for product manufactured from existing inventory, commercial sales of Alferon\u00ae will not resume until new batches of Alferon\u00ae inventory and API can be produced, filled and finished, and released by the FDA for commercial sale. (Please see Part 1, Item I: \u201cBusiness; Our Products; Manufacturing\u201d above for more information).\nIf we are unable to gain necessary FDA approvals related to Ampligen\u00ae and Alferon\u00ae on a timely basis, our operations most likely will be materially and/or adversely affected. Additionally, if we are unable to generate the additional data, successfully complete inspections or obtain approvals as required by the FDA on a timely manner, or at all, or determine that any of our clinical studies are not cost/justified to undertake or if, for that or any other reason, Ampligen\u00ae, Alferon\u00ae or one of our other products or production processes do not receive necessary regulatory approval in the U.S. or elsewhere:\n\u25cf our ability to generate revenues to sustain our operations will be substantially impaired, which would increase the likelihood that we would need to obtain additional financing for our other development efforts;\n\u25cf our reputation among investors might be harmed, which might make it more difficult for us to obtain equity capital on attractive terms or at all; and\n\u25cf our profitability would be delayed, our business will be materially harmed and our stock price may be adversely affected.\nBiotechnology stock prices, including our stock price, have declined significantly in certain instances where companies have failed to meet expectations with respect to FDA approval or the timing for FDA approval.\nWe may continue to incur substantial losses and our future profitability is uncertain.\nWe last reported net profit from 1985 through 1987. Since 1987, with a major emphasis on new drug diagnostic and development, we have incurred substantial operating losses, as we pursued our clinical trial effort to get our experimental drug, Ampligen\u00ae, approved. As of December 31, 2017, our accumulated deficit was approximately $308,760,000. We have not yet generated significant revenues from our products and may incur substantial and increased losses in the future. We cannot assure that we will ever achieve significant revenues from product sales or become profitable. We require, and will continue to require, the commitment of substantial resources to develop our products. We cannot assure that our product development efforts will be successfully completed or that required regulatory approvals will be obtained or that any products will be manufactured and marketed successfully, or be profitable.\nWe will require additional financing which may not be available.\nThe development of our products requires the commitment of substantial resources to conduct the time consuming research, preclinical development, and clinical trials that are necessary to bring pharmaceutical products to market. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $2,107,000 in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities (inclusive of approximately $695,000 in Marketable Securities). However, if we are unable to commercialize and sell Ampligen\u00ae and/or recommence material sales of Alferon N Injection\u00ae, our operations, financial position and liquidity may be adversely impacted.\nIn its CRL, the FDA communicated that Hemispherx should conduct at least one additional clinical trial, complete various nonclinical studies and perform a number of data analyses. We are actively engaged with the FDA, and have had several meetings in order to reach an agreement on the path forward. At this point in time, we cannot predict how long it would take to run an additional trial and submit the data to the FDA for approval of the drug product. We anticipate that the time and cost to undertake clinical trial(s), studies and data analysis are beyond our current financial resources without gaining access to additional funding.\nGiven the challenging economic conditions, we continue to review every aspect of our operations for cost and spending reductions to assure our long-term financial stability while maintaining the resources necessary to achieve our primary objectives of obtaining NDA approval of Ampligen\u00ae along with the manufacturing, marketing and distribution of our products, including Alferon N Injection\u00ae. Due to the repair issues mentioned above within our NJ facility and the high cost estimates to bring the facility back online, we will need additional funds to finance the revalidation process in our facility to initiate commercial manufacturing, thereby readying ourselves for an FDA Pre-Approval Inspection. We also will need additional capital to eventually commercialize and sell Ampligen\u00ae and/or recommence and increase sales of Alferon N Injection\u00ae or our other products. We anticipate considering multiple options in an attempt to secure funding, including but not limited to such methods as the sales of additional equity, licensing agreements, partnering with other organizations, debt financing or other sources of capital. If we are unable to obtain additional funding, through an Equity Distribution Agreement (\u201cEDA\u201d) or other sales of securities and/or otherwise, our ability to develop our products, commercially produce inventory or continue our operations may be materially adversely affected.\nOur Alferon N Injection\u00ae Commercial Sales were halted due to lack of finished goods inventory. If we are unable to gain the necessary FDA approvals related to Alferon\u00ae, our operations most likely will be materially and/or adversely affected.\nCommercial sales of Alferon N Injection\u00ae were halted in March 2008 when our finished goods inventory expired. The production of Alferon N Injection\u00ae from the Work-In-Process Inventory was restarted in May 2010, continued into January 2011 with its conversion into API.\nIn April 2012, FDA reviewers raised certain questions about the status of our existing lots of older Work-In-Process Alferon\u00ae materials and Alferon\u00ae API, which would need to be released by the FDA before those materials could be used in commercial product. After conducting all of the appropriate tests on samples of the inventory during 2013, we concluded that we could not alleviate certain questions the FDA had about the older Work-In-Process Alferon N Injection\u00ae and their remaining dollar value has been written-off. Commercial sales of Alferon\u00ae will not resume until new batches of Alferon\u00ae inventory and API can be produced, filled and finished, and released by the FDA for commercial sale.\nWhile our facility is FDA approved under the BLA by the FDA for Alferon\u00ae, this status will need to be reaffirmed upon the completion of the facility\u2019s upgrades for Alferon\u00ae. We cannot provide any guarantee that the facility will necessarily pass a FDA pre-approval inspection for Ampligen\u00ae or Alferon\u00ae manufacture, which are conducted in separately dedicated areas within the overall New Brunswick manufacturing complex. Please see the Risk Factor \u201cThere is no assurance that our manufacturing facility will again be granted a BLA certification by the FDA upon completion of the manufacturing enhancements or return to commercial, large-scale production.\u201d below for more information.\nIf we are unable to gain the necessary FDA approvals related to the manufacturing process and/or final product of new Alferon\u00ae inventory, our operations most likely will be materially and/or adversely affected. For more information on Alferon N Injection\u00ae regarding potential commercial sales, please see Part II, Item 7: \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business; Manufacturing\u201d.\nIn light of these contingencies, there can be no assurances that the approved Alferon N Injection\u00ae product will be returned to production on a timely basis, if at all, or that if and when it is again made commercially available, it will return to prior sales levels.\nWe may not be profitable unless we can protect our patents and/or receive approval for additional pending patents.\nWe need to preserve and acquire enforceable patents covering the use of Ampligen\u00ae for a particular disease in order to obtain exclusive rights for the commercial sale of Ampligen\u00ae for such disease. We obtained all rights to Alferon N Injection\u00ae, and we plan to preserve and acquire enforceable patents covering its use for existing and potentially new diseases. Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to preserve and obtain patent protection for our products and to obtain and preserve our trade secrets and expertise. Certain of our know-how and technology is not patentable, particularly the procedures for the manufacture of our experimental drug, Ampligen\u00ae. We also have been issued a patent which affords protection on the use of Ampligen\u00ae in patients with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. We have not yet been issued any patents in the United States for the use of Ampligen\u00ae as a sole treatment for any of the cancers which we have sought to target. For more information on Patents, please see PART I, Item I - \u201cBusiness; Patents\u201d.\nWe cannot assure that our competitors will not seek and obtain patents regarding the use of similar products in combination with various other agents, for a particular target indication prior to our doing so. If we cannot protect our patents covering the use of our products for a particular disease, or obtain additional patents, we may not be able to successfully market our products.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical firms is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions.\nTo date, no consistent policy has emerged regarding the breadth of protection afforded by pharmaceutical and biotechnology patents. There can be no assurance that new patent applications relating to our products, process or technology will result in patents being issued or that, if issued, such patents will afford meaningful protection against competitors with similar technology. It is generally anticipated that there may be significant litigation in the industry regarding patent and intellectual property rights. Such litigation could require substantial resources from us and we may not have the financial resources necessary to enforce the patent rights that we hold. No assurance can be made that our patents will provide competitive advantages for our products, process and technology or will not be successfully challenged by competitors. No assurance can be given that patents do not exist or could not be filed which would have a materially adverse effect on our ability to develop or market our products or to obtain or maintain any competitive position that we may achieve with respect to our products. Our patents also may not prevent others from developing competitive products or process using related technology.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain necessary licenses if we cannot enforce patent rights we may hold. In addition, the failure of third parties from whom we currently license certain proprietary information or from whom we may be required to obtain such licenses in the future, to adequately enforce their rights to such proprietary information, could adversely affect the value of such licenses to us.\nIf we cannot enforce the patent rights we currently hold we may be required to obtain licenses from others to develop, manufacture or market our products. There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain any such licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. We currently license certain proprietary information from third parties, some of which may have been developed with government grants under circumstances where the government maintained certain rights with respect to the proprietary information developed. No assurances can be given that such third parties will adequately enforce any rights they may have or that the rights, if any, retained by the government will not adversely affect the value of our license.\nThere is no guarantee that our trade secrets will not be disclosed or known by our competitors.\nTo protect our rights, we require all employees and certain consultants to enter into confidentiality agreements with us. There can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate and enforceable remedies for any breach, or that any trade secrets of ours will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors.\nWe have limited marketing and sales capability. If we are unable to obtain additional distributors and our current and future distributors do not market our products successfully, we may not generate significant revenues or become profitable.\nWe have limited marketing and sales capability. We are dependent upon existing and, possibly future, marketing agreements and third party distribution agreements for our products in order to generate significant revenues and become profitable. As a result, any revenues received by us will be dependent in large part on the efforts of third parties, and there is no assurance that these efforts will be successful.\nOur commercialization strategy for Ampligen\u00ae for CFS, if and when it is approved for marketing and sale by the FDA, may include licensing/co-marketing agreements utilizing the resources and capacities of a strategic partner(s). We continue to seek a world-wide marketing partner with the goal of having a relationship in place before approval is obtained. In parallel to partnering discussions, appropriate pre-marketing activities will be undertaken. It is our current intention to control manufacturing of Ampligen\u00ae on a world-wide basis.\nOur commercialization strategy for Alferon N Injection\u00ae may include the utilization of internal functions and/or licensing/co-marketing agreements that would utilize the resources and capacities of one or more strategic partners. Accordingly, we have engaged Asembia, formerly Armada Healthcare, LLC, to undertake the marketing, education and sales of Alferon N Injection\u00ae throughout the United States along with GP Pharm for both Ampligen\u00ae and Alferon\u00ae in Argentina along with other South and Latin American countries.\nWe cannot assure that our U.S. or foreign marketing strategy will be successful or that we will be able to establish future marketing or third party distribution agreements on terms acceptable to us, or that the cost of establishing these arrangements will not exceed any product revenues. Our inability to establish viable marketing and sales capabilities would most likely have a materially adverse effect on us. There can be no assurances that the approved Alferon N Injection\u00ae product will be returned to prior sales levels.\nThere are no long-term agreements with suppliers of required materials and services for Ampligen\u00ae and there are a limited number of raw material suppliers. If we are unable to obtain the required raw materials and/or services, we may not be able to manufacture Ampligen\u00ae.\nA number of essential raw materials are used in the production of Ampligen\u00ae as well as packaging materials utilized in the fill and finish process. We do not have, but continue to work towards having long-term agreements for the supply of such materials, when possible. There can be no assurance we can enter into long-term supply agreements covering essential materials on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nThere are a limited number of suppliers in the United States and abroad available to provide the raw and packaging materials/reagents for use in manufacturing Ampligen\u00ae and Alferon\u00ae. At present, we do not have any agreements with third parties for the supply of any of these materials or we are relying on a limited source of reagent suppliers necessary for the manufacture of Alferon\u00ae. We have established relevant manufacturing operations within our New Brunswick, New Jersey facility for the production of Ampligen\u00ae polymers from raw materials in order to obtain a more consistent manufacturing basis in the quantities necessary for clinical testing. We had a Supply Agreement with Jubilant Hollister-Stier LLC of Spokane, Washington (\u201cJubilant\u201d), pursuant to which Jubilant would formulate and package Ampligen\u00ae from the key raw materials that we would supply. This Supply Agreement expired March 11, 2014. On January 3, 2017, we entered into a purchase order with Jubilant pursuant to which Jubilant will manufacture a commercial batch of Ampligen\u00ae for us. Pursuant to the new order, Jubilant will perform tooling and validation activities as well as final fill and finish services. In July 2016, we reached an agreement with Avecia to serve as an additional contract manufacturer of Ampligen\u00ae for use with clinical studies as well as the recently initiated Early Access Program (EAP) in Europe and Turkey. Should there be an unanticipated delay in receiving new product from Jubilant and/or Avecia at that time, or should we experience an unexpected demand for Ampligen\u00ae in our clinical studies or pursuant to the EAP, our ability to supply Ampligen\u00ae most likely will be adversely affected.\nIn addition, during the final stage of the manufacturing process we encountered issues regarding a change in both the contract supplier of leukocytes and the long term supply availability related to a reagent used in the formulation of Alferon\u00ae. We have substantially resolved these issues through engaging in multiple agreements with suppliers of leukocytes as well as entering into a licensing agreement with a foreign multinational chemicals and biotechnology company that has been in business for over a century for the sourcing of the primary reagent allowing us to manufacture Alferon\u00ae. However, due to the interruption of the required flow of leukocytes, production ceased, causing parts to malfunction in the upstream process when the system was restarted for testing. We were working diligently to make the necessary repairs to be able to restart the validation process; however, in the process of obtaining time estimates for the repairs we experienced a flood within portions of our manufacturing facility. As a result, we will be constrained in our ability to manufacture product in the near future due to this flood in the upstream processing cleanroom that contains the bioreactor. The flood occurred on the afternoon of January 5, 2016, caused by a malfunctioning water supply pipe for the sprinkler system covering a large amount of the cleanroom in stagnant water and silt from the sprinkler system. Our facility insurer has been proactive in addressing and covering the loss. While repairs have required preapproval by our insurer, activity moved forward quickly. The repairs noted below required special action because of the need to keep this critical manufacturing room within International Organization for Standardization (ISO) classifications and the need to certify that all the equipment that was exposed, or submerged, is in proper condition and operating effectively following the corrective actions. All HEPA filters affected by the flood were tested by an outside contractor and have passed all required tests. The flooring that was damaged has been repaired using a special epoxy that is used in cleanrooms. A large portion of the walls in the ISO classified area were damaged. We had a damage mitigation company come in to stop any moisture from seeping further into the ISO classified areas. Subsequently, all damaged walls and ceilings have been replaced with cleanroom grade materials and need no further work. Six pumps that were affected by the flood were sent back to the manufacturer for inspection and repair. Repairs that were required have been completed on the pumps and they were reinstalled in the Alferon\u00ae manufacturing facility after the floor repair work was completed. All pumps will need to be qualified for use in the manufacturing process prior to the validation process for a Pre-Approval Inspection. All air ducts supplying the Alferon\u00ae manufacturing area were cleaned and the insulation replaced along with ceiling tiles. All smaller pieces of machinery and equipment that could not be salvaged have been replaced. We also completed the HVAC air balancing and qualification. At this time, we believe that all repairs to the manufacturing facility have been completed.\nCurrently, the manufacturing process is on hold and there is no definitive timetable to have the facility back online. If we are unable to gain the necessary FDA approvals related to the manufacturing process and/or final product of new Alferon\u00ae inventory, our operations most likely will be materially and/or adversely affected. In light of these contingencies, there can be no assurances that the approved Alferon N Injection\u00ae product will be returned to production on a timely basis, if at all, or that if and when it is again made commercially available, it will return to prior sales levels.\nIf we are unable to obtain or manufacture the required materials/reagents, and/or procure services needed in the final steps in the manufacturing process, we may be unable to manufacture Ampligen\u00ae. The costs and availability of products and materials we need for the production of Ampligen\u00ae are subject to fluctuation depending on a variety of factors beyond our control, including competitive factors, changes in technology, ownership of intellectual property, FDA and other governmental regulations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such products and materials on terms acceptable to us or at all. For more information on Ampligen\u00ae manufacturing, please see Part 1, Item I: \u201cBusiness; Our Products; Manufacturing\u201d above.\nThere are a limited number of organizations in the United States available to provide the final manufacturing steps of formulation, fill, finish and packing sets for Alferon N Injection\u00ae and Ampligen\u00ae.\nThere are a limited number of organizations in the United States available to provide the final steps in the manufacturing for Alferon N Injection\u00ae and Ampligen\u00ae. To formulate, fill, finish and package our products (\u201cfill and finish\u201d), we require a FDA approved third party CMO.\nIn January 2012, we agreed to a Technology, Transfer, Validation and Commercial Supply Agreement with Althea regarding the fill and finish process for Alferon N Injection\u00ae. As we no longer have any existing inventory, commercial sales of Alferon\u00ae will not resume until new batches of Alferon\u00ae inventory and API can be produced, filled and finished, and released by the FDA for commercial sale.\nWe had a Supply Agreement with Jubilant Hollister-Stier LLC of Spokane, Washington (\u201cJubilant\u201d), pursuant to which Jubilant would formulate and package Ampligen\u00ae from the key raw materials that Hemispherx would supply to them. This Supply Agreement expired March 11, 2014. We are working towards an amendment to the existing Supply Agreement which may contain additional fees as part of entering into the extension. In January 2017, we entered into a purchase order to replace the previous purchase commitment with Jubilant pursuant to which Jubilant will manufacture batches of Ampligen\u00ae for us. Pursuant to the new order, Jubilant will perform tooling and validation activities as well as final fill and finish services. The first lot is expected to be manufactured in the second quarter of 2018, once all validation activities are complete.\nWe are unable to provide any assurances that the FDA will approve the inventory manufactured by us or produced by Jubilant. If this finish goods inventory is not granted approval by the FDA, our operations may be materially adversely affected.\nShould there be an unanticipated delay in receiving new product or should we experience an unexpected demand for Ampligen\u00ae in our clinical studies or pursuant to the EAP, our ability to supply Ampligen\u00ae most likely will be adversely affected. If we are unable to procure services needed in the final steps in the manufacturing process, we may be unable to manufacture Alferon N Injection\u00ae and/or Ampligen\u00ae. The costs and availability of products and materials we need for the production of Ampligen\u00ae and the commercial production of Alferon N Injection\u00ae and other products which we may commercially produce are subject to fluctuation depending on a variety of factors beyond our control, including competitive factors, changes in technology, and FDA and other governmental regulations and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such products and materials on terms acceptable to us or at all. For more information on Ampligen\u00ae and Alferon N Injection\u00ae manufacturing, please see Part 1, Item I: \u201cBusiness; Our Products; Manufacturing\u201d above.\nThere is no assurance that our manufacturing facility will again be granted a BLA certification by the FDA or return to commercial, large-scale production. In addition, our inability to timely fix the issues caused by the 2016 flood in our manufacturing facility could hinder our ability to sustain sales of our products, if and when such sales commence.\nWe completed the construction of our facility enhancement project in 2015 which, upon FDA approval, should provide for a higher capacity, more cost effective manufacturing process for the production of Alferon N Injection\u00ae. The production of new Alferon\u00ae API inventory commenced in February 2015. While the facility is approved by FDA under the BLA for Alferon\u00ae, this status will need to be reaffirmed upon the completion of the facility\u2019s enhancements prior to commercial sale of newly produced inventory product. If and when we obtain a reaffirmation of FDA BLA status, we will need FDA approval to release the final product confirming the quality and stability to allow commercial sales to resume. For more information, please see Part II, Item 7: \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business; Our Products; Manufacturing\u201d above for more information. There can be no assurance the BLA status will be recertified by the FDA upon the completion of the enhancement process or that the manufacturing facility will return to commercial, large-scale production for Alferon\u00ae. Additionally, there can be no assurance that any given product will be determined to be safe and effective, or capable of being manufactured under applicable quality standards.\nOnly if and when our BLA status is recertified by the FDA to produce Alferon\u00ae API at our enhanced manufacturing facility and Althea gains FDA\u2019s approval to formulate, fill and finish Alferon\u00ae, can batches of Alferon\u00ae be released by the FDA for commercial sales. We are unable to provide any assurances that the FDA will approve our enhanced manufacturing process and/or newly created finish product lots formulated, filled and finished at Althea. Without FDA approval, our Alferon N Injection\u00ae will not be considered suitable for commercial sales.\nOur ability to manufacture at our manufacturing facility was also hampered and delayed by the flood. See Part I, Item 1. Business: \u201cMarketing\u201d.\nIn light of these contingencies, there can be no assurances that the approved Alferon N Injection\u00ae product will be returned to commercial production or sale on a timely basis, if at all, or that if and when it is again made commercially available, it will return to prior sales levels.\nThere is no assurance that upon successful manufacture of a drug on a limited scale basis for investigational use will lead to a successful transition to commercial, large-scale production.\nChanges in methods of manufacturing, including commercial scale-up, may affect the chemical structure of Ampligen\u00ae and other RNA drugs, as well as their safety and efficacy. The transition from limited production of pre-clinical and clinical research quantities to production of commercial quantities of our products will involve distinct management and technical challenges and may require additional management, technical personnel and capital to the extent such manufacturing is not handled by third parties. While we believe that we could successfully upgrade our production capability at our New Brunswick, NJ facility in a commercial scale-up of Ampligen\u00ae, there can be no assurance that our manufacturing will be successful or that any given product will be determined to be safe and effective, or capable of being manufactured under applicable quality standards, economically, and in commercial quantities, or successfully marketed.\nWe have limited manufacturing experience for Ampligen\u00ae and Alferon\u00ae. We may not be profitable unless we can produce Ampligen\u00ae, Alferon\u00ae or other products in commercial quantities at costs acceptable to us.\nSatisfactory inspection by the FDA of both our Ampligen\u00ae and Alferon\u00ae manufacturing process is required before commercial sale of project would be allowed. The CRL from the FDA on February 1, 2013, requests evaluation of variation between lots of Ampligen\u00ae tested in the development process and recommends tighter control of the Ampligen\u00ae manufacturing process. We cannot provide any guarantee that the facility will pass a FDA pre-approval inspection for Ampligen\u00ae or Alferon\u00ae manufacture, which are conducted in separately dedicated areas within the overall New Brunswick manufacturing complex. The failure to obtain FDA approval for either of our manufacturing process areas would most likely have a materially adverse impact upon us.\nAmpligen\u00ae has been produced to date in limited quantities for use in our clinical trials, and we are dependent upon a qualified third party supplier for the manufacturing, filling, finish and packaging process. The failure to continue these arrangements or to achieve other such arrangements on satisfactory terms could have a material adverse effect on us. In furtherance of the capital improvement program at our New Brunswick, NJ facility to upgrade our manufacturing capability to produce bulk quantities of Alferon N Injection\u00ae API, the validation phase of the Alferon\u00ae manufacturing project is currently underway. While the facility is approved by FDA under the BLA for Alferon\u00ae, this status will need to be reaffirmed upon the completion of the facility\u2019s enhancements prior to commercial sale of newly produced inventory product. If and when we obtain a reaffirmation of FDA BLA status, we will need FDA approval to release the final product confirming the quality and stability to allow commercial sales to resume. For more information, please see Part 1, Item I: \u201cBusiness; Our Products; Manufacturing\u201d above. In light of these contingencies, there can be no assurances that the approved Alferon N Injection\u00ae product will be returned to production on a timely basis, if at all. The failure to obtain FDA approval of any of our manufacturing process would most likely have a materially adverse impact upon us.\nAlso to be successful, our products must be manufactured in commercial quantities in compliance with regulatory requirements and at acceptable costs. We believe, but cannot assure, that our enhancements to our manufacturing facilities will be adequate for our future needs for the production of our proposed products for large-scale commercialization. We intend to ramp up our existing facility and/or utilize third party facilities if and when the need arises or, if we are unable to do so, to build or acquire commercial-scale manufacturing facilities. We will need to comply with regulatory requirements for such facilities, including those of the FDA pertaining to cGMP requirements or maintaining our BLA status. There can be no assurance that such facilities can be used, built, or acquired on commercially acceptable terms, or that such facilities, if used, built, or acquired, will be adequate for the production of our proposed products for large-scale commercialization or our long-term needs.\nWe have never produced Ampligen\u00ae, Alferon\u00ae or any other products in large commercial quantities. We must manufacture our products in compliance with regulatory requirements in large commercial quantities and at acceptable costs in order for us to be profitable. We intend to utilize third party manufacturers and/or facilities if and when the need arises or, if we are unable to do so, to build or acquire commercial-scale manufacturing facilities. If we cannot manufacture commercial quantities of Ampligen\u00ae and/or Alferon\u00ae, or continue to maintain third party agreements for its manufacture at costs acceptable to us, our operations will be significantly affected. If and when the Ampligen\u00ae NDA is approved, we may need to find an additional vendor to manufacture the product for commercial sales. Also, each production lot of Alferon N Injection\u00ae is subject to FDA review and approval prior to releasing the lots to be sold. This review and approval process could take considerable time, which would delay our having product in inventory to sell, nor can we provide any assurance as to the receipt of FDA approval of our finished inventory product. There can be no assurances that the Ampligen\u00ae and/or Alferon\u00ae can be commercially produced at costs acceptable to us.\nRapid technological change may render our products obsolete or non-competitive.\nThe pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are subject to rapid and substantial technological change. Technological competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities, governmental entities and others diversifying into the field is intense and is expected to increase. Most of these entities have significantly greater research and development capabilities than us, as well as substantial marketing, financial and managerial resources, and represent significant competition for us. There can be no assurance that developments by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive or that we will be able to keep pace with technological developments.\nOur products may be subject to substantial competition.\nAmpligen\u00ae. Competitors may be developing technologies that are, or in the future may be, the basis for competitive products. Some of these potential products may have an entirely different approach or means of accomplishing similar therapeutic effects to products being developed by us. These competing products may be more effective and less costly than our products. In addition, conventional drug therapy, surgery and other more familiar treatments may offer competition to our products. Furthermore, many of our competitors have significantly greater experience than we do in preclinical testing and human clinical trials of pharmaceutical products and in obtaining FDA, HPB and other regulatory approvals of products. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining FDA, HPB or other regulatory product approvals more rapidly than us. There are no drugs approved for commercial sale with respect to treating CFS in the United States. The dominant competitors with drugs to treat disease indications which we plan to address include Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck & Co., Novartis and AstraZeneca. Biotech competitors include Baxter International, Fletcher/CSI, AVANT Immunotherapeutics, AVI BioPharma and Genta. These potential competitors are among the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world, are well known to the public and the medical community, and have substantially greater financial resources, product development, and manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we have. Although we believe our principal advantage is the unique mechanism of action of Ampligen\u00ae on the immune system, we cannot assure that we will be able to compete.\nAlferon N Injection\u00ae. Our competitors are among the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world, are well known to the public and the medical community, and have substantially greater financial resources, product development, and manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we have. Alferon N Injection\u00ae currently competes with Merck\u2019s injectable recombinant alpha interferon product (Intron\u00ae A) for the treatment of genital warts. In addition, other pharmaceutical firms offer self-administered topical cream, for the treatment of external genital and perianal warts such as Graceway Pharmaceuticals (Aldara\u00ae), Watson Pharma (Condylox\u00ae) and MediGene (Veregen\u00ae). Alferon N Injection\u00ae also competes with surgical, chemical, and other methods of treating genital warts. We cannot assess the impact products developed by our competitors, or advances in other methods of the treatment of genital warts, will have on the commercial viability of Alferon N Injection\u00ae. If and when we obtain additional approvals of uses of this product, we expect to compete primarily on the basis of product performance. Our competitors have developed or may develop products (containing either alpha or beta interferon or other therapeutic compounds) or other treatment modalities for those uses. There can be no assurance that, if we are able to obtain regulatory approval of Alferon N Injection\u00ae for the treatment of new indications, we will be able to achieve any significant penetration into those markets. In addition, because certain competitive products are not dependent on a source of human blood cells, such products may be able to be produced in greater volume and at a lower cost than Alferon N Injection\u00ae. Currently, our wholesale price on a per unit basis of Alferon N Injection\u00ae is higher than that of the competitive recombinant alpha and beta interferon products. Please see risk factor \u201cWe may not be profitable unless we can protect our patents and/or receive approval for additional pending patents\u201d above for additional information.\nGeneral. Other companies may succeed in developing products earlier than we do, obtaining approvals for such products from the FDA more rapidly than we do, or developing products that are more effective than those we may develop. While we will attempt to expand our technological capabilities in order to remain competitive, there can be no assurance that research and development by others or other medical advances will not render our technology or products obsolete or non-competitive or result in treatments or cures superior to any therapy we develop.\nPossible side effects from the use of Ampligen\u00ae or Alferon N Injection\u00ae could adversely affect potential revenues and physician/patient acceptability of our product.\nAmpligen\u00ae. We believe that Ampligen\u00ae has been generally well tolerated with a low incidence of clinical toxicity, particularly given the severely debilitating or life threatening diseases that have been treated. A mild flushing reaction has been observed in approximately 15-20% of patients treated in our various studies. This reaction is occasionally accompanied by a rapid heartbeat, a tightness of the chest, urticaria (swelling of the skin), anxiety, shortness of breath, subjective reports of \u201cfeeling hot\u201d, sweating and nausea. The reaction is usually infusion-rate related and can generally be controlled by reducing the rate of infusion. Other adverse side effects include liver enzyme level elevations, diarrhea, itching, asthma, low blood pressure, photophobia, rash, visual disturbances, slow or irregular heart rate, decreases in platelets and white blood cell counts, anemia, dizziness, confusion, elevation of kidney function tests, occasional temporary hair loss and various flu-like symptoms, including fever, chills, fatigue, muscular aches, joint pains, headaches, nausea and vomiting. These flu-like side effects typically subside within several months.\nThe FDA in its February 1, 2013 CRL, provided recommendations to address certain outstanding issues before they could approve Ampligen for Commercial Sales. The Agency stated that the submitted data do not provide substantial evidence of efficacy of Ampligen\u00ae for the treatment of CFS and that the data do not provide sufficient information to determine whether the product is safe for use in CFS due to the limited size of the safety database and multiple discrepancies within the submitted data.\nIf approved, one or more of the potential side effects of the drug might deter usage of Ampligen\u00ae in certain clinical situations and therefore, could adversely affect potential revenues and physician/patient acceptability of our product.\nAlferon N Injection\u00ae. At present, Alferon N Injection\u00ae is approved for the intralesional (within the lesion) treatment of refractory or recurring external genital warts in adults. In clinical trials conducted for the treatment of genital warts with Alferon N Injection\u00ae, patients did not experience serious side effects; however, there can be no assurance that unexpected or unacceptable side effects will not be found in the future for this use or other potential uses of Alferon N Injection\u00ae which could threaten or limit such product\u2019s usefulness.\nWe may be subject to product liability claims from the use of Ampligen\u00ae, Alferon N Injection\u00ae, or other of our products which could negatively affect our future operations. We have limited product liability and clinical trial insurance.\nWe maintain a limited amount of Products Liability and Clinical Trial insurance coverage world-wide for Ampligen\u00ae and Alferon\u00ae due to the minimal amount of historical loss claims regarding these products in the marketplace. Any claims against our products, Ampligen\u00ae and Alferon N Injection\u00ae, could have a materially adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of Ampligen\u00ae, Alferon N Injection\u00ae or other of our products results in adverse effects. This liability might result from claims made directly by patients, hospitals, clinics or other consumers, or by pharmaceutical companies or others manufacturing these products on our behalf. Our future operations may be negatively affected from the litigation costs, settlement expenses and lost product sales inherent to these claims. While we will continue to attempt to take appropriate precautions, we cannot assure that we will avoid significant product liability exposure.\nThe loss of services of key personnel could hurt our chances for success.\nOur success is dependent on the continued efforts of our staff, especially certain doctors and researchers. The loss of the services of personnel key to our operations could have a material adverse effect on our operations and chances for success. The loss of key personnel or the failure to recruit additional personnel as needed could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to achieve our objectives.\nUncertainty of health care reimbursement for our products.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which reimbursement for the cost of such products and related treatment will be available from government health administration authorities, private health coverage insurers and other organizations. Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products, and from time to time legislation is proposed, which, if adopted, could further restrict the prices charged by and/or amounts reimbursable to manufacturers of pharmaceutical products. We cannot predict what, if any, legislation will ultimately be adopted or the impact of such legislation on us. There can be no assurance that third party insurance companies will allow us to charge and receive payments for products sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.\nThere are risks of liabilities associated with handling and disposing of hazardous materials.\nOur business involves the controlled use of hazardous materials, carcinogenic chemicals, flammable solvents and various radioactive compounds. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply in all material respects with the standards prescribed by applicable regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of such an accident or the failure to comply with applicable regulations, we could be held liable for any damages that result. However, we have obtained insurance coverage to mitigate any potential significant loss in this area.\nWe rely upon information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology, including any cyber security incidents, could harm our ability to operate our business effectively.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of third parties with which we contract are vulnerable to damage from cyber-attacks, computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. System failures, accidents or security breaches could cause interruptions in our operations, and could result in a material disruption of our business operations, in addition to possibly requiring substantial expenditures of resources to remedy. The loss of clinical trial data could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate public disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and our product development and commercialization efforts could be delayed.\nRisks Associated with an Investment in Our Common Stock:\nThe market price of our stock may be adversely affected by market volatility.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and is likely to be volatile. This is especially true given the current significant instability in the financial markets. In addition to general economic, political and market conditions, the price and trading volume of our stock could fluctuate widely in response to many factors, including:\n\u25cf announcements of the results of clinical trials by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf announcements of availability or projections of our products for commercial sale;\n\u25cf announcements of legal actions against us and/or settlements or verdicts adverse to us;\n\u25cf adverse reactions to products;\n\u25cf governmental approvals, delays in expected governmental approvals or withdrawals of any prior governmental approvals or public or regulatory agency comments regarding the safety or effectiveness of our products, or the adequacy of the procedures, facilities or controls employed in the manufacture of our products;\n\u25cf changes in U.S. or foreign regulatory policy during the period of product development;\n\u25cf developments in patent or other proprietary rights, including any third party challenges of our intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf announcements of technological innovations by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf announcements of new products or new contracts by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated variations in our operating results due to the level of development expenses and other factors;\n\u25cf changes in financial estimates by securities analysts and whether our earnings meet or exceed the estimates;\n\u25cf conditions and trends in the pharmaceutical and other industries;\n\u25cf new accounting standards;\n\u25cf overall investment market fluctuation;\n\u25cf restatement of prior financial results;\n\u25cf notice of NYSE American non-compliance with requirements; and\n\u25cf occurrence of any of the risks described in these \u201cRisk Factors\u201d.\nOur common stock is listed for quotation on the NYSE American. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the trading price of our common stock has ranged from $0.30to $0.93per share. We expect the price of our common stock to remain volatile. The average daily trading volume of our common stock varies significantly.\nOur stock price may be adversely affected if a significant amount of shares is sold in the public market.\nWe may issue shares to be used to meet our capital requirements or use shares to compensate employees, consultants and/or Directors. In this regard, we have registered securities for public sale pursuant to a universal shelf registration statement and we had been selling shares under this shelf registration statement. Since December 5, 2017, we have sold an aggregate of 2,003,563 shares under our under our equity distribution agreements with Maxim Group LLC. In September 2016, we sold 3,333,334 shares of our common stock and issued warrants to purchase 2,500,000 shares of common stock. The warrants were exercised in June and July 2017. In February we sold 1,818,185 shares of our common stock and issued warrants. In February 2017, these warrants were exchanged for warrants to purchase an aggregate of 5,300,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.45 per share, most exercisable commencing December 1, 2017. We have registered the shares issuable upon exercise of these warrants for public sale and, should the market price of our common stock exceed the exercise price of these warrants, some or all of these warrants may be exercised. There were 2,800,000 warrants with an expiration date of March 1, 2018 and an exercise price on $0.45. These warrants were exercised in January and February 2018. We realized proceeds of $1,260,000 from these exercises.\nWe are unable to estimate the amount, timing or nature of future sales of outstanding common stock or instruments convertible into or exercisable for our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, including additional sale of securities pursuant to our equity distribution agreements with Maxim Group LLC or otherwise under the universal shelf registration statement or upon exercise of outstanding options and warrants, could cause the market price for our common stock to decrease. Furthermore, a decline in the price of our common stock would likely impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of common stock or other equity securities. Please see Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Result of Operations; Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d in PART II.\nProvisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and Delaware law could defer a change of our Management which could discourage or delay offers to acquire us.\nProvisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and Delaware law may make it more difficult for someone to acquire control of us or for our stockholders to remove existing management, and might discourage a third party from offering to acquire us, even if a change in control or in Management would be beneficial to our stockholders. For example, our Certificate of Incorporation allows us to issue shares of preferred stock without any vote or further action by our stockholders. Our Board of Directors has the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred stock. Our Board of Directors also has the authority to issue preferred stock without further stockholder approval. As a result, our Board of Directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to holders the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation, the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of common stock and the right to the redemption of the shares, together with a premium, prior to the redemption of our common stock. On November 19, 2002, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a dividend distribution of one Right for each outstanding share of Common Stock to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 29, 2002 (the \u201cRecord Date\u201d). On November 2, 2012, at the direction of the Board of Directors of the Company amended and restated the Rights Agreement between the Company and its Rights Agent. On November 14, 2017, at the direction of the Board, the Company again amended and restated the Rights Agreement between the Company and, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, its current Rights Agent (as amended and restated, the \u201cRights Agreement\u201d). Each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company a unit consisting of one one-hundredth of a share (a \u201cUnit\u201d) of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the \u201cSeries A Preferred Stock\u201d) at a Purchase Price of $21.00 per Unit, subject to adjustment.\nSpecial Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements\nBecause the risk factors referred to above could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us, you should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement or statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict which will arise. In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Our research in clinical efforts may continue for the next several years and we may continue to incur losses due to clinical costs incurred in the development of Ampligen\u00ae for commercial application. Possible losses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of differences in the timing of significant expenses incurred and receipt of licensing fees and/or cost recovery treatment revenue.
