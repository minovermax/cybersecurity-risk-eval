{"cik": "1371217", "company": "ReShape Lifesciences Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-05-16", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur acquisition of the assets related to the Lap-Band System from Apollo Endosurgery, Inc. in December 2018 could adversely affect our operations, financial results and financial condition.\nIn December 2018, we acquired substantially all of the assets exclusively related to Apollo Endosurgery, Inc.\u2019s Lap-Band product line and Apollo acquired from us substantially all of the assets exclusively related to our ReShape Balloon product line. In addition, we agreed to pay Apollo $17 million in cash, of which $10 million was paid at the closing of the transaction, $2 million is payable on the first anniversary of the closing date, $2 million is payable on the second anniversary of the closing date, and $3 million is payable on the third anniversary of the closing date.\nA successful acquisition depends on our ability to identify, negotiate, complete and integrate such acquisition and to obtain any necessary financing. With respect to our acquisition of the Lap-Band product line and any future acquisitions, we may experience:\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in integrating the acquired businesses and their respective personnel and products into our existing business;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in integrating commercial organizations;\n\u00b7\ndelays in transferring regulatory approvals from Apollo to ReShape Lifesciences\n\u00b7\ndifficulties or delays in realizing the anticipated benefits of the acquisition;\n\u00b7\ndiversion of our management\u2019s time and attention from other business concerns;\n\u00b7\nchallenges due to limited or no direct prior experience in new markets or countries we may enter;\n\u00b7\ninability to successfully develop new products and services on a timely basis that address our new market opportunities post-acquisition;\n\u00b7\ninability to compete effectively against companies already serving the broader market opportunities expected to be available to us post-acquisition;\n\u00b7\nunanticipated costs and other contingent liabilities; and\n\u00b7\nany unforeseen compliance risks and accompanying financial and reputational exposure or loss not uncovered in the due diligence process and which are imputed to our company, such as compliance with federal laws and regulations, the advertising and promotion regulations under the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Anti-kickback Statute, the False Claims Act, the Physician Sunshine Payments Act and other applicable laws.\nWe have invested, and expect to continue to invest, significant cash and other resources in connection with our acquisition of the Lap-Band product line, including our obligation to pay the remaining $7 million of the purchase price. Our efforts to successfully integrate and continue the commercialization of the Lap-Band product line will require significant cash expenditures. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts. Should we be unable to obtain adequate financing or generate sufficient revenue in the future, our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition could be materially and adversely harmed.\nWe face a risk of default under our security agreement with Apollo that we entered into in connection with our acquisition of the Lap-Band product line and under our subordinated secured debentures that we issued in March 2019.\nIn connection with our acquisition of the Lap-Band product line, we entered into a security agreement with Apollo pursuant to which we granted to Apollo a security interest in substantially all of our assets as security for our obligations under the asset purchase agreement entered into in connection with the transaction, including our obligation to pay the cash purchase price. The security interest will be terminated upon the earlier of the date we pay the cash purchase price to Apollo in full or complete an equity financing raising gross proceeds of at least $15 million. In March 2019, we issued $2.2 million in aggregate principal amount subordinated secured debentures and a related security agreement to secure our payment obligations under the debentures, which obligations and security interest are subordinated to our obligations to and security interest of Apollo. If we default on our payment obligations, Apollo and our other secured lenders have the right to enforce their rights under the security agreements, including by enforcing their security interest and taking control of substantially all of our assets and declaring the entire remaining portion of our outstanding obligations to be immediately due and payable. In addition, the security agreements contain certain restrictions that may adversely affect our ability to engage in certain business activities or finance our future operations or capital needs. Transactions that we may view as important opportunities, such as acquisitions, may be subject to the consent of Apollo or our other secured lenders, which consent may be withheld or granted subject to conditions specified at the time that may affect the attractiveness or viability of the transaction.\nIf we do not achieve the contemplated benefits of our acquisition of the Lap-Band product line, our business and financial condition may be materially impaired.\nWe may not achieve the desired benefits from our acquisition of the Lap-Band product line. For any of the reasons described above and elsewhere in this report and even if we are able to successfully integrate the Lap-Band product line within our company, we may not be able to realize the revenue and other growth that we anticipate from the acquisition in the time frame that we currently expect, and the costs of achieving these benefits may be higher than what we currently expect, because of a number of risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7\nthe possibility that the acquisition may not further our business strategy as we expected; and\n\u00b7\nthe possibility that the revenue from the Lap-Band product line may be lower than we expected.\nAs a result of these risks, we may not achieve the anticipated strategic and financial benefits of the Lap-Band acquisition.\nIf we are unable to either substantially improve our operating results or obtain additional financing in the future, we will be unable to continue as a going concern.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s report on our December 31, 2018 audited financial statements includes an explanatory paragraph referring to our ability to continue as a going concern. The proceeds from any future financings that we may be able to obtain, if any, together with our other available cash, may not be sufficient to fund our operating expenses, capital expenditures and other cash requirements. Should we be unable to obtain adequate financing or generate sufficient revenue in the future, our business, result of operations, liquidity and financial condition would be materially and adversely harmed, and we would be unable to continue as a going concern. These events and circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise additional capital and on the market value of our common stock and the warrants offered hereby. Moreover, should we experience a cash shortage that requires us to curtail or cease our operations, or should we be unable to continue as a going concern, you could lose all or part of your investments in our securities.\nWe currently are not generating revenue from operations that is significant relative to our level of operating expenses, and we do not anticipate generating revenue sufficient to offset operating costs in the short-term to mid-term. We have financed our operations to date principally through the sale of equity securities. Our history of operating losses, limited cash resources and lack of certainty regarding obtaining significant third-party reimbursement for our products or timing thereof, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. As of December 31, 2018, we had $5.5 million of cash and cash equivalents. We expect our current cash and cash equivalents to fund our operations through early 2019.\nOur anticipated operations include plans to (i) integrate the sales and operations of the Lap-Band product line as well as to obtain cost savings synergies (ii) continue development of the ReShape Vest, (iii) seek opportunities to leverage our intellectual property portfolio and custom development services to provide third party sales and licensing opportunities, and (iv) explore and capitalize on synergistic opportunities to expand our portfolio and offer future minimally invasive treatments and therapies in the obesity continuum of care. We believe that we have the flexibility to manage the growth of our expenditures and operations depending on the amount of available cash flows, which could include reducing expenditures for marketing, clinical and product development activities. However, we will ultimately need to achieve sufficient revenues from product sales and obtain additional debt or equity financing in addition to the proceeds from this offering to support our operations.\nOur ReShape Vest product is in the early stages of clinical evaluation. If the clinical trial is not successfully completed or any required regulatory approvals are not obtained, the ReShape Vest may not be commercialized and our business prospects may suffer.\nOur ReShape Vest product is in the early stages of development and is currently in the early stages of clinical evaluation. Our ability to market the ReShape Vest in the United States and abroad depends upon our ability to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the product with clinical data to support our requests for regulatory approval. The ReShape Vest may not be found to be safe and, where required, effective in clinical trials and may not ultimately be approved for marketing by U.S. or foreign regulatory authorities, which would have a negative impact on our net sales.\nThere is no assurance that we will be successful in achieving the desired results in our anticipated clinical trials for the ReShape Vest or, if we do, that the FDA or other regulatory agencies will approve the product for sale without the need for additional clinical trial data to demonstrate safety and efficacy. We continually evaluate the potential financial benefits and costs of clinical trials and the products being evaluated in them. If we determine that the costs associated with obtaining regulatory approval of a product exceed the potential financial benefits of that product or if the projected development timeline is inconsistent with our investment horizon, we may choose to stop a clinical trial and/or the development of a product.\nThe shares of series C convertible preferred stock issued in connection with our acquisition of ReShape Medical have certain rights and preferences senior to our common stock, including a liquidation preference that is senior to our common stock.\nThere are currently 95,388 shares of our series C convertible preferred stock outstanding, which are convertible into 4,543 shares of our common stock. We issued the shares of our series C convertible preferred stock in connection with our acquisition of ReShape Medical. The series C convertible preferred stock has a liquidation preference of\n$274.8774 per share, or $5,772.4254 per underlying share of common stock, or approximately $26.2 million in the aggregate. Holders of the series C convertible preferred stock have the right to convert their shares into shares of common stock instead of receiving the liquidation preference. In general, the series C convertible preferred stock is entitled to receive dividends (on an as-if-converted-to-common stock basis) actually paid on shares of common stock when, as and if such dividends are paid on shares of common stock. No other dividends will be paid on shares of series C convertible preferred stock. While the series C convertible preferred stock generally does not have voting rights, as long as any shares of series C convertible preferred stock remain outstanding, we cannot, without the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of series C convertible preferred stock, (a) alter or change adversely the powers, preferences or rights given to the series C convertible preferred stock (including by the designation, authorization, or issuance of any shares of preferred stock that purports to have equal rights with, or be senior in rights or preferences to, the series C convertible preferred stock), (b) alter or amend the series C convertible preferred stock certificate of designation, (c) amend our certificate of incorporation or other charter documents in any manner that adversely affects any rights of the holders of series C convertible preferred stock, (d) increase the number of authorized shares of series C convertible preferred stock or (e) enter into any agreement with respect to any of the foregoing.\nWe are a medical device company with a limited history of operations and sales, and we cannot assure you that we will ever generate substantial revenue or be profitable.\nWe are a medical device company with a limited operating history upon which you can evaluate our business. We have been engaged in research and development and clinical trials since our inception in 2002 and have invested substantially all of our time and resources in developing our products and product candidates. The success of our business will depend on our ability to establish a sales force, make sales and control costs, as well as our ability to obtain additional regulatory approvals needed to market new versions of our Lap-Band system or regulatory approvals needed to market our ReShape Vest and any other products we may develop in the future, all of which we may be unable to do. If we are unable to successfully market our Lap-Band system for its indicated use or develop and commercialize the ReShape Vest, we may never become profitable and may have to cease operations as a result. Our lack of a significant operating history also limits your ability to make a comparative evaluation of us, our products and our prospects.\nWe have incurred losses since inception and we anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe have incurred losses in each year since our formation in 2002. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our loss from continuing operations was $35.3 million and $30.5 million, respectively, and our net loss attributable to common stockholders was $84.2 million and $33.8 million, respectively. We have funded our operations to date principally from the sale of securities and the issuance of indebtedness. Development of a new medical device, including conducting clinical trials and seeking regulatory approvals, is a long, expensive and uncertain process. We expect to incur significant sales and marketing expenses prior to recording sufficient revenue to offset these expenses. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to add the infrastructure necessary to support our initial commercial sales, market the Lap-Band system, develop the ReShape Vest, operate as a public company and develop our intellectual property portfolio. For these reasons, we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses for the next several years. These losses, among other things, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing new medical devices, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when we will become profitable, if ever.\nDuring the second quarter of 2018 we were required to record a non-cash goodwill impairment loss, which significantly impacted our results of operations, and we may be exposed to additional impairment losses that could be material.\nWe conduct our annual goodwill impairment analysis for our businesses during the fourth quarter of each year or when circumstances suggest that an indicator for impairment may be present. Subsequent to our registered direct securities offering on April 3, 2018, the price of our common stock declined significantly and, given the decline which indicated a potential impairment of some or all of our goodwill, requiring us to perform an impairment analysis that included valuing all the tangible and intangible assets of the business. We performed an impairment analysis during the second quarter of 2018 resulting in a write-off of goodwill from continuing operations of $14.0 million and a write-off of goodwill from discontinued operations of $13.2 million. These goodwill write-offs had a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In the future, we may have additional indicators of potential impairment requiring us to record an\nimpairment loss related to our remaining indefinite-lived and finite-lived intangible assets, which could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe will need substantial additional funding and may be unable to raise capital when needed, which would force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or liquidate some or all of our assets.\nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception. We expect to continue to spend substantial amounts on the development and commercialization of our products and on research and development, including conducting current and future clinical trials for our Lap-Band system, ReShape Vest (if approved for sale) and subsequent versions of our products. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, net cash used in operating activities from continuing operations was $20.1 million and $22.1 million, respectively, and net cash used in operating activities (including discontinued operations) was $27.5 million and $24.6 million, respectively. We expect that our cash used in operations will continue to be significant in the upcoming years, and that we will need to raise additional capital to commercialize our Lap-Band system, to develop the ReShape Vest, to continue our research and development programs, and to fund our ongoing operations.\nOur future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u00b7\nthe cost and timing of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities;\n\u00b7\nthe cost of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of our Lap-Band system, ReShape Vest and any products that we may develop; the rate of market acceptance of our Lap-Band system, ReShape Vest and any other product candidates;\n\u00b7\nthe rate of market acceptance of our Lap-Band system, ReShape Vest and any other product candidates;\n\u00b7\nthe cost of filing and prosecuting patent applications and defending and enforcing our patent and other intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7\nthe cost of defending, in litigation or otherwise, any claims that we infringe third-party patent or other intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7\nthe effect of competing products and market developments;\n\u00b7\nthe cost of explanting clinical devices;\n\u00b7\nthe terms and timing of any collaborative, licensing or other arrangements that we may establish;\n\u00b7\nany revenue generated by sales of our Lap-Band system, ReShape Vest or our future products;\n\u00b7\nthe scope, rate of progress, results and cost of any clinical trials and other research and development activities;\n\u00b7\nthe cost and timing of obtaining any further required regulatory approvals; and\n\u00b7\nthe extent to which we invest in products and technologies, although we currently have no commitments or agreements relating to these types of transactions.\nUntil the time, if ever, when we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue, we expect to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings, debt financings or corporate collaboration, licensing arrangements and grants, as well as through interest income earned on cash balances.\nAdditional capital may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience dilution. Debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants or additional security interests in our assets. Any additional debt or equity financing that we complete may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders. If we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties, it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our technologies or products, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If we are unable to raise adequate funds, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate some or all of, our development programs or liquidate some or all of our assets.\nWe may be subject to fines, restrictions or prohibitions on sales, or other penalties for failure to maintain licenses in certain states.\nCertain of our licenses in states in which we currently conduct our business are expired, and we may not maintain required licenses in every state in which we conduct business. As a result, we could be subject to fines, restrictions or prohibitions on its sales, or other penalties under applicable state laws, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC have imposed various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations result in increased legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure. In particular, we are required to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal controls over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Our testing may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses. There have been material weaknesses identified in the past and we have identified a material weakness as of December 31, 2018 related to our ability to maintain adequate accounting resources with a sufficient understanding of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d) to allow the Company to identify and properly account for new complex transactions. Specifically, we did not design and implement internal controls around research and development expenses paid to a CRO. This material weakness resulted in our not identifying that certain research and development expenses paid to the CRO in connection with the clinical trial of the ReShape Vest are required to be capitalized under GAAP, and recognized into expense as the value of the capitalized asset is realized.\nWe have incurred and continue to expect to incur significant expense and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with Section 404 and remediating material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting. Moreover, if we do not comply with the requirements of Section 404, or if we identify additional deficiencies in our internal controls that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would entail expenditure of additional financial and management resources.\nWe face significant uncertainty in the industry due to government healthcare reform.\nIn the United States, there have been and continue to be a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended, (the \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d) as well as any future healthcare reform legislation, may have a significant impact on our business. The impact of the Affordable Care Act on the health care industry is extensive and includes, among other things, the federal government assuming a larger role in the health care system, expanding healthcare coverage of United States citizens and mandating basic healthcare benefits. The Affordable Care Act contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and to reduce costs of Medicare and Medicaid, including imposing a 2.3% excise tax on domestic sales of many medical devices by manufacturers that began in 2013. Although a moratorium was placed on the medical device excise tax through 2019, if Congress does not pass legislation further extending or otherwise eliminating the excise tax, our sales and selling, general and administrative expenses may be adversely affected in the future.\nCongress is considering legislation to replace or repeal elements or all of the Affordable Care Act. In addition, there have been recent public announcements by members of Congress and the current presidential administration regarding their plans to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Further, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the Affordable Care Act to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the Affordable Care Act that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or\nmedical devices. At this time, it is not clear whether the Affordable Care Act will be repealed in whole or in part, and, if it is repealed, whether it will be replaced in whole or in part by another plan and what impact those changes will have on coverage and reimbursement for healthcare items and services covered by plans that were authorized by the Affordable Care Act. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, and also indirectly affect the amounts that private payers are willing to pay. In addition, any healthcare reforms enacted in the future may, like the Affordable Care Act, be phased in over a number of years but, if enacted, could reduce our revenue, increase our costs, or require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business or put us at risk for loss of business. In addition, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by changes under the Affordable Care Act and changes under any federal or state legislation adopted in the future.\nWe are subject, directly or indirectly, to United States federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse and false claims laws and regulations. Prosecutions under such laws have increased in recent years and we may become subject to such litigation. If we are unable to, or have not fully complied with such laws, we could face substantial penalties.\nOur operations are directly, or indirectly through customers, subject to various state and federal fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and federal False Claims Act. These laws may impact, among other things, our sales, marketing and education programs.\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Several courts have interpreted the statute\u2019s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and, despite a series of narrow safe harbors, prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. Penalties for violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. Many states have also adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.\nThe federal False Claims Act prohibits persons from knowingly filing, or causing to be filed, a false claim to, or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from the federal government. Suits filed under the False Claims Act, known as \u201cqui tam\u201d actions, can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government and such individuals, commonly known as \u201cwhistleblowers,\u201d may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. The frequency of filing qui tam actions has increased significantly in recent years, causing greater numbers of medical device, pharmaceutical and healthcare companies to have to defend a False Claim Act action. When an entity is determined to have violated the federal False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties for each separate false claim. Various states have also enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act.\nWe are unable to predict whether we could be subject to actions under any of these laws, or the impact of such actions. If we are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or other applicable state and federal fraud and abuse laws, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government healthcare reimbursement programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry that is subject to rapid change. If our competitors are able to develop and market products that are safer or more effective than our products, our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated.\nThe health care industry is highly competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants. The obesity treatment market in which we operate has grown significantly in recent years and is expected to continue to expand as technology continues to evolve and awareness of the need to treat the obesity epidemic grows. Although we are not aware of any competitors in the neuroblocking market, we face potential competition from pharmaceutical and surgical obesity treatments. Many of our competitors in the obesity treatment field have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved\nproducts than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly if they pursue competing solutions through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies, such as Allergan, Apollo Endosurgery, Boston Scientific, LivaNova PLC, Johnson & Johnson, Medtronic or St. Jude Medical. Our competitors may develop and patent processes or products earlier than us, obtain regulatory approvals for competing products more rapidly than we are able to and develop more effective, safer and less expensive products or technologies that would render our products non-competitive or obsolete.\nFailure to protect our information technology infrastructure against cyber-based attacks, network security breaches, service interruptions, or data corruption could significantly disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe currently rely on information technology and telephone networks and systems, including the Internet, to process and transmit sensitive electronic information and will rely on such systems to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including sales, billing, customer service, procurement and supply chain, manufacturing, and distribution. We use enterprise information technology systems to record, process, and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal, and tax requirements.\nOur information technology systems, some of which are managed by third-parties, may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, user errors or catastrophic events. We are not aware of any breaches of our information technology infrastructure. Despite the precautionary measures we have taken to prevent breakdowns in our information technology and telephone systems, if our systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and we are unable to effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our business and operating results may suffer.\nRisks Associated with Development and Commercialization of the Lap-Band system and ReShape Vest\nOur efforts to increase revenue from our Lap-Band system and commercialize the ReShape Vest may not succeed or may encounter delays which could significantly harm our ability to generate revenue.\nOur ability to generate revenue will depend upon the sales of our Lap-Band system and successful commercialization of our ReShape Vest (if approved for sale). Our efforts to commercialize these products may not succeed for a number of reasons, including:\n\u00b7\nwe may not be able to obtain the regulatory approvals required for our ReShape Vest;\n\u00b7\nour products may not be accepted in the marketplace by physicians, patients and third-party payers;\n\u00b7\nthe price of our products, associated costs of the surgical procedure and treatment and the availability of sufficient third-party reimbursement for the system implantation and follow-up procedures;\n\u00b7\nappropriate reimbursement and/or coding options may not exist to enable billing for the system implantation and follow-up procedures for our ReShape Vest;\n\u00b7\ncoverage policies for bariatric surgeries, including Lap-Band may be restricted in the future;\n\u00b7\nwe may not be able to sell our products at a price that allows us to meet the revenue targets necessary to generate enough revenue for profitability;\n\u00b7\nthe frequency and severity of any side effects of our products;\n\u00b7\nphysicians and potential patients may not be aware of the perceived effectiveness and sustainability of the results of our products;\n\u00b7\nwe, or the investigators of our products, may not be able to have information on the outcome of the trials published in medical journals;\n\u00b7\nthe availability and perceived advantages and disadvantages of alternative treatments;\n\u00b7\nany rapid technological change may make our products obsolete;\n\u00b7\nwe may not be able to have our products manufactured in commercial quantities or at an acceptable cost;\n\u00b7\nwe may not have adequate financial or other resources to complete the development and commercialization of our products or to develop sales and marketing capabilities for our products; and\n\u00b7\nwe may be sued for infringement of intellectual property rights and could be enjoined from manufacturing or selling our products.\nBesides requiring physician adoption, market acceptance of our products will depend on successfully communicating the benefits of our products to three additional constituencies involved in deciding whether to treat a particular patient using our products: (1) the potential patients themselves; (2) institutions such as hospitals, where the procedure would be performed and opinion leaders in these institutions; and (3) third-party payers, such as private healthcare insurers and governmental payers, such as Medicare and Medicaid in the United States, which would ultimately bear most of the costs of the various providers and equipment involved in our Lap-Band system and ReShape Vest (if approved for sale). Marketing to each of these constituencies requires a different marketing approach, and we must convince each of these groups of the efficacy and utility of our products to be successful.\nIf our products, or any other therapy or products for other gastrointestinal diseases and disorders that we may develop, do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by the relevant constituencies, we may not generate significant product revenue and may not become profitable.\nWe may not be able to obtain required regulatory approvals for our ReShape Vest in a cost-effective manner or at all, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nThe production and marketing of our ReShape Vest and our ongoing research and development, preclinical testing and clinical trial activities are subject to extensive regulation and review by numerous governmental authorities both in the United States and abroad. U.S. and foreign regulations applicable to medical devices are wide-ranging and govern, among other things, the development, testing, marketing and premarket review of new medical devices, in addition to regulating manufacturing practices, reporting, advertising, exporting, labeling and record keeping procedures. We are required to obtain regulatory approval before we can market our ReShape Vest in the United States and certain foreign countries. The regulatory process will require significant time, effort and expenditures to bring products to market, and it is possible that our ReShape Vest will not be approved for sale. Even if regulatory approval of our ReShape Vest is granted, it may not be granted within the timeframe that we expect, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Even after our ReShape Vest is approved by the FDA, we may have ongoing responsibilities under FDA regulations, non-compliance of which could result in the subsequent withdrawal of such approvals, or such approvals could be withdrawn due to the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval. We also are subject to medical device reporting regulations that require us to report to the FDA if any of our products causes or contributes to a death or serious injury or if a malfunction were it to occur might cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. Any failure to obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis or the subsequent withdrawal of such approvals could prevent us from successfully marketing our products, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe depend on clinical investigators and clinical sites to enroll patients in our clinical trials, and on other third parties to manage the trials and to perform related data collection and analysis, and, as a result, we may face costs and delays that are outside of our control.\nWe rely on clinical investigators and clinical sites to enroll patients in our clinical trials and other third parties to manage the trials and to perform related data collection and analysis. However, we may not be able to control the amount and timing of resources that clinical sites may devote to our clinical trials. If these clinical investigators and clinical sites fail to enroll a sufficient number of patients in our clinical trials, ensure compliance by patients with clinical protocols or comply with regulatory requirements, we will be unable to complete these trials, which could prevent us from obtaining or maintaining regulatory approvals for our product. Our agreements with clinical investigators and clinical trial sites for clinical testing place substantial responsibilities on these parties and, if these parties fail to perform\nas expected, our trials could be delayed or terminated. If these clinical investigators, clinical sites or other third parties do not carry out their contractual duties or obligations or fail to meet expected deadlines, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to their failure to adhere to our clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, or the clinical data may be rejected by the FDA, adversely affecting our ability to successfully commercialize our product.\nModifications to the Lap-Band system may require additional approval from regulatory authorities, which may not be obtained or may delay our commercialization efforts.\nThe FDA and our European Notified Body require medical device companies to initially make and document a determination of whether or not a modification requires a new approval, supplement or clearance; however, some of these regulatory authorities can review a company\u2019s decision. Any modifications to an approved device that could significantly affect its safety or efficacy, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use could require additional clinical studies and separate regulatory applications. Product changes or revisions will require all the regulatory steps and associated risks discussed above possibly including testing, regulatory filings and clinical study. We may not be able to obtain approval of supplemental regulatory approvals for product modifications, new indications for our product or new products. Delays in obtaining future clearances would adversely affect our ability to introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner, which in turn would harm our commercialization efforts and future growth.\nIf we or our suppliers fail to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements, or if we experience unanticipated product problems, our Lap-Band system could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market.\nAny product for which we obtain marketing approval, along with the manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data and promotional activities for such product, will be subject to continual review and periodic inspections by our European Notified Body and the FDA and other regulatory bodies. In particular we and our manufacturers and suppliers are required to comply with ISO requirements, Good Manufacturing Practices, which for medical devices is called the Quality System Regulation (\u201cQSR\u201d), and other regulations which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping of any product for which we obtain marketing approval. The FDA enforces the QSR through inspections, which may be unannounced, and the CE system enforces its certification through inspections and audits as well. Our quality system has received certification of compliance to the requirements of ISO 13485:2016 and will have to continue to successfully complete such inspections to maintain regulatory approvals for sales outside of the United States. Failure by us or one of our manufacturers or suppliers to comply with statutes and regulations administered by the FDA, CE authorities and other regulatory bodies, or failure to adequately respond to any observations, could result in enforcement actions against us or our manufacturers or suppliers, including, restrictions on our product or manufacturing processes, withdrawal of the product from the market, voluntary or mandatory recall, fines, suspension of regulatory approvals, product seizures, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nIf any of these actions were to occur it would harm our reputation and cause our product sales to suffer. Furthermore, our key component suppliers may not currently be or may not continue to be in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. If the FDA or any other regulatory body finds their compliance status to be unsatisfactory, our commercialization efforts could be delayed, which would harm our business and our results of operations.\nAdditionally, if the FDA determines that our promotional materials, training or other activities constitute promotion of an unapproved use, we could be subject to significant liability, the FDA could request that we cease, correct or modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our training or other promotional materials to constitute promotion of an unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement.\nWe are subject to medical device reporting regulations that require us to report to the FDA, Competent Authorities or other governmental authorities in other countries if our products cause or contribute to a death or serious injury or malfunction in a way that would be reasonably likely to contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. The FDA and similar governmental authorities in other countries have the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacturing. A government mandated, or voluntary, recall by us could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors or design defects, including defects in labeling. Any recall would divert managerial and financial resources and could harm our reputation with\ncustomers. There can be no assurance that there will not be product recalls in the future or that such recalls would not have a material adverse effect on our business. Once the product is approved and implanted in a large number of patients, infrequently occurring adverse events may appear that were not observed in the clinical trials. This could cause health authorities in countries where the product is available to take regulatory action, including marketing suspension and recall.\nIf we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into and maintain arrangements with third parties to market and sell our Lap-Band product, our business may be harmed.\nWe have limited experience as a company in sales, marketing and distribution of our products. We market our products in the United States through a direct sales force supported by field technical managers who provide training, technical and other support services to our customers. Apollo Endosurgery will serve as our exclusive distributor of the Lap-Band system outside of the United States and Canada for up to two years following our acquisition of the Lap-Band system. Developing a sales force is expensive and time consuming and we may be unable to develop an effective sales and marketing organization on a timely basis, if at all, or maintain our current sales and marketing capabilities, either of which would delay or prevent us from generating enough revenue to become profitable. Our sales force will be competing with the experienced and well-funded marketing and sales organizations of our more established competitors. If we are unable to establish and maintain our own sales and marketing capabilities, we will need to contract with third parties to market and sell our product. In this event, our profit margins would likely be lower than if we performed these functions ourselves. In addition, we would necessarily be relying on the skills and efforts of others for the successful marketing of our product. If we are unable to establish and maintain effective sales and marketing capabilities, independently or with others, we may not be able to generate product revenue and may not become profitable.\nThe commercialization of our products in countries outside the United States will expose our business to certain risks associated with international operations.\nWe currently sell our Lap-Band system in the United States, Canada and Australia. Conducting international operations subjects us to unique risks, including:\n\u00b7\nunfamiliar legal requirements with which we would need to comply;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u00b7\npotentially adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added tax systems and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings;\n\u00b7\nincreased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities; and\n\u00b7\nreduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries.\nThe occurrence of any one of these risks could negatively affect our business and results of operations generally. Additionally, operating in international markets requires significant management attention. We cannot be certain that investments required to establish operations in other countries will produce desired levels of revenues or profitability.\nWe may be unable to attract and retain management and other personnel we need to succeed.\nOur success depends on the services of our senior management and other key employees. The loss of the services of one or more of our officers or key employees could delay or prevent the successful completion of our clinical trials and the commercialization of our Lap-Band system and the development of our ReShape Vest. Our continued growth will require hiring a number of qualified clinical, scientific, commercial and administrative personnel. Accordingly, recruiting and retaining such personnel in the future will be critical to our success. There is intense competition from other companies and research and academic institutions for qualified personnel in the areas of our activities. If we fail to identify, attract, retain and motivate these highly skilled personnel, we may be unable to continue our development and commercialization activities.\nWe may be unable to manage our growth effectively.\nOur business strategy entails significant future growth. For example, we will have to expand existing operations in order to increase revenue from our Lap-Band system and develop our ReShape Vest, conduct additional clinical trials, increase our contract manufacturing capabilities, hire and train new personnel to handle the marketing and sales of our product, assist patients and healthcare providers in obtaining reimbursement for the use of our product and create and develop new applications for our technology. This growth may place significant strain on our management and financial and operational resources. Successful growth is also dependent upon our ability to implement appropriate financial and management controls, systems and procedures. Our ability to effectively manage growth depends on our success in attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel, for which the competition may be intense. If we fail to manage these challenges effectively, our business could be harmed.\nWe face the risk of product liability claims that could be expensive, divert management\u2019s attention and harm our reputation and business. We may not be able to obtain adequate product liability insurance.\nOur business exposes us to a risk of product liability claims that is inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of medical devices. The medical device industry has historically been subject to extensive litigation over product liability claims. We may be subject to product liability claims if our products cause, or appear to have caused, an injury. Claims may be made by consumers, healthcare providers, third-party strategic collaborators or others selling our products.\nWe have product liability insurance, which covers the use of our products in our clinical trials and any commercial sales, in an amount we believe is appropriate. Our current product liability insurance may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all, and, if available, the coverage may not be adequate to protect us against any future product liability claims. If we are unable to obtain insurance at an acceptable cost and on acceptable terms for an adequate coverage amount, or otherwise to protect against potential product liability claims, we could be exposed to significant liabilities, which may harm our business. A product liability claim, recall or other claim with respect to uninsured liabilities or for amounts in excess of insured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These liabilities could prevent or interfere with our product commercialization efforts. Defending a suit, regardless of merit, could be costly, could divert management attention and might result in adverse publicity, which could result in the withdrawal of, or inability to recruit, clinical trial volunteers or result in reduced acceptance of our products in the market.\nWe may be subject to product liability claims even if it appears that the claimed injury is due to the actions of others. For example, we rely on the expertise of surgeons and other associated medical personnel to perform the medical procedure to implant and remove our products and to perform the related therapy. If these medical personnel are not properly trained or are negligent, the therapeutic effect of our products may be diminished or the patient may suffer critical injury, which may subject us to liability. In addition, an injury that is caused by the negligence of one of our suppliers in supplying us with a defective component that injures a patient could be the basis for a claim against us. A product liability claim, regardless of its merit or eventual outcome, could result in decreased demand for our products; injury to our reputation; diversion of management\u2019s attention; withdrawal of clinical trial participants; significant costs of related litigation; substantial monetary awards to patients; product recalls or market withdrawals; loss of revenue; and the inability to commercialize our products under development.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights relating to our technology and neuroblocking therapy, the commercial value of our technology and any future products will be adversely affected and our competitive position will be harmed.\nOur commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain protection in the United States and other countries for our Lap-Band system and ReShape Vest by establishing and maintaining intellectual property rights relating to or incorporated into our technology and products. We own numerous U.S. and foreign patents and have numerous patent applications pending, most of which pertain to treating gastrointestinal disorders and the treatment of obesity. We have also received or applied for additional patents outside the United States. Our pending and future patent applications may not issue as patents or, if issued, may not issue in a form that will provide us any competitive advantage. We expect to incur substantial costs in obtaining patents and, if necessary, defending our proprietary rights. The patent positions of\nmedical device companies, including ours, can be highly uncertain and involve complex and evolving legal and factual questions. We do not know whether we will obtain the patent protection we seek, or that the protection we do obtain will be found valid and enforceable if challenged. If we fail to obtain adequate protection of our intellectual property, or if any protection we obtain is reduced or eliminated, others could use our intellectual property without compensating us, resulting in harm to our business. We may also determine that it is in our best interests to voluntarily challenge a third-party\u2019s products or patents in litigation or administrative proceedings, including patent interferences, re-examinations or under more recently promulgated Inter Partes Review proceedings, depending on when the patent application was filed. In the event that we seek to enforce any of our owned or exclusively licensed patents against an infringing party, it is likely that the party defending the claim will seek to invalidate the patents we assert, which, if successful could result in the loss of the entire patent or the relevant portion of our patent, which would not be limited to any particular party. Any litigation to enforce or defend our patent rights, even if we were to prevail, could be costly and time-consuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. Even if we were to prevail in any litigation, we cannot assure you that we can obtain an injunction that prevents our competitors from practicing our patented technology. Our competitors may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or products without infringing any of our patent or other intellectual property rights, or may design around our proprietary technologies.\nWe cannot assure you that we will obtain any patent protection that we seek, that any protection we do obtain will be found valid and enforceable if challenged or that it will confer any significant commercial advantage. U.S. patents and patent applications may also be subject to interference proceedings and U.S. patents may be subject to re-examination proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d), or under more recently promulgated Inter Partes Review proceedings, depending on when the patent application was filed, and foreign patents may be subject to opposition or comparable proceedings in the corresponding foreign patent offices, which proceedings could result in either loss of the patent or denial of the patent application, or loss or reduction in the scope of one or more of the claims of, the patent or patent application. In addition, such interference, re-examination and opposition proceedings may be costly. Moreover, the U.S. patent laws have recently changed with the adoption of the America Invents Act (\u201cAIA\u201d), possibly making it easier to challenge patents. Some of our technology was, and continues to be, developed in conjunction with third parties, and thus there is a risk that such third parties may claim rights in our intellectual property. Thus, any patents that we own or license from others may provide limited or no protection against competitors. Our pending patent applications, those we may file in the future, or those we may license from third parties, may not result in patents being issued. If issued, they may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology.\nNon-payment or delay in payment of patent fees or annuities, whether intentional or unintentional, may result in loss of patents or patent rights important to our business. Many countries, including certain countries in Europe, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of the patent. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States, particularly in the field of medical products and procedures.\nMany of our competitors have significant resources and incentives to apply for and obtain intellectual property rights that could limit or prevent our ability to commercialize our current or future products in the United States or abroad.\nMany of our competitors who have significant resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies may seek to apply for and obtain patents that will prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use or sell our products either in the United States or in international markets. Our current or future U.S. or foreign patents may be challenged, circumvented by competitors or others or may be found to be invalid, unenforceable or insufficient. In most cases in the United States patent applications are published 18 months after filing the application, or corresponding applications are published in other countries, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file patent applications for such inventions.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know-how, the value of our technology and products could be adversely affected.\nIn addition to patented technology, we rely on our unpatented proprietary technology, trade secrets, processes and know-how. We generally seek to protect this information by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants,\nscientific advisors and third parties. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors. To the extent that our employees, consultants or contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.\nIntellectual property litigation is a common tactic in the medical device industry to gain competitive advantage. If we become subject to a lawsuit, we may be required to expend significant financial and other resources and our management\u2019s attention may be diverted from our business.\nThere has been a history of frequent and extensive litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry, and companies in the medical device industry have employed intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage. Accordingly, we may become subject to patent infringement claims or litigation in a court of law, or interference proceedings declared by the USPTO to determine the priority of inventions or an opposition to a patent grant in a foreign jurisdiction. We may also become subject to claims or litigation seeking payment of royalties based on sales of our product in connection with licensing or similar joint development arrangements with third parties or in connection with claims of patent infringement.\nSpecifically, on April 20, 2017, Fulfillium, Inc. filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware accusing ReShape Medical, our wholly owned subsidiary, of trade secret misappropriation and patent infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 9,445,930 and 9,456,915, which we are currently in the process of defending. The defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits, USPTO interference proceedings, reexamination proceedings, or under more recently promulgated Inter Partes Review proceedings, depending on when the patent application was filed, or opposition proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings, are both costly and time consuming and could result in substantial uncertainty to us. Litigation or regulatory proceedings may also be necessary to enforce patent or other intellectual property rights of ours or to determine the scope and validity of other parties\u2019 proprietary rights. Any litigation, opposition or interference proceedings, with or without merit, may result in substantial expense to us, cause significant strain on our financial resources, divert the attention of our technical and management personnel and harm our reputation. We may not have the financial resources to defend our patents from infringement or claims of invalidity. An adverse determination in any litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require us to seek licenses from or pay royalties to third parties or prevent us from manufacturing, selling or using our proposed products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nOur Lap-Band system or ReShape Vest may infringe or be claimed to infringe patents that we do not own or license, including patents that may issue in the future based on patent applications of which we are currently aware, as well as applications of which we are unaware. For example, we are aware of other companies that are investigating neurostimulation, including neuroblocking, and of patents and published patent applications held by companies in those fields. While we believe that none of such patents and patent applications are applicable to our products and technologies under development, third parties who own or control these patents and patent applications in the United States and abroad could bring claims against us that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and, if such claims are successfully asserted against us, they could cause us to pay substantial damages, could result in an injunction preventing us from selling, manufacturing or using our proposed products and would divert management\u2019s attention. Because patent applications in many countries such as the United States are maintained under conditions of confidentiality and can take many years to issue, there may be applications now pending of which we are unaware and which may later result in issued patents that our products infringe. If a patent infringement suit were brought against us, we could be forced to stop our ongoing or planned clinical trials, or delay or abandon commercialization of the product that is subject of the suit.\nAs a result of patent infringement claims, or to avoid potential claims, we may choose or be required to seek a license from a third-party and be required to pay license fees or royalties, or both. A license may not be available at all or on commercially reasonable terms, and we may not be able to redesign our products to avoid infringement. Modification of our products or development of new products could require us to conduct additional clinical trials and to revise our filings with the FDA and other regulatory bodies, which would be time-consuming and expensive. Even if we were able to obtain a license, the rights may be nonexclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we could be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations if, as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims, we are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms. This could harm our business significantly.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur common stock has been delisted from the Nasdaq Stock Market and our shares currently trade on an over-the-counter market.\nOn December 27, 2018, we received a written notice from the Office of General Counsel of The Nasdaq Stock Market notifying us that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the \u201cPanel\u201d) had determined to delist our securities pursuant to Nasdaq\u2019s discretionary authority under Listing Rule 5101. The Panel also cited in its decision our failure to maintain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement under Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) and our failure to comply with Listing Rule 5250(e), which requires a company to file a Notification Form Listing of Additional Shares at least 15 days prior to the issuance or potential issuance of common stock greater than 10% of the total shares outstanding. As a result of the Panel\u2019s decision, Nasdaq suspended trading in our common stock effective with the open of business on December 31, 2018 and our common stock has now been delisted from Nasdaq.\nOur common stock currently trades on the OTCQB market and therefore may have less liquidity and may experience potentially more price volatility than experienced on Nasdaq. Stockholders may not be able to sell their shares of common stock on the OTCQB market in the quantities, at the times, or at the prices that could potentially be available on a more liquid trading market. The delisting of our common stock from Nasdaq could also adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for our operations and/or result in a loss of confidence by investors or employees.\nOur common stock may be deemed to be a \u201cpenny stock\u201d and broker-dealers who make a market in our stock may be subject to additional compliance requirements.\nIf our common stock is deemed to be a \u201cpenny stock\u201d as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, broker-dealers who make a market in our stock will be subject to additional sales practice requirements for selling our common stock to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. For instance, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction prior to the sale. Consequently, the penny stock rules, if they were to become applicable, would affect the ability or willingness of broker-dealers to sell our securities, and accordingly would affect the ability of stockholders to sell their securities in the public market. These additional procedures could also limit our ability to raise additional capital in the future.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been volatile and is likely to be volatile in the future.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile and may be more volatile now that it trades on the OTCQB Market and not the Nasdaq Capital Market. The market price for our common stock will be affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nthe denial or delay of regulatory clearances or approvals of our product or receipt of regulatory approval of competing products;\n\u00b7\nour ability to accomplish clinical, regulatory and other product development milestones and to do so in accordance with the timing estimates we have publicly announced;\n\u00b7\nchanges in policies affecting third-party coverage and reimbursement in the United States and other countries;\n\u00b7\nchanges in government regulations and standards affecting the medical device industry and our product;\n\u00b7\nability of our products to achieve market success;\n\u00b7\nthe performance of third-party contract manufacturers and component suppliers;\n\u00b7\nour ability to develop sales and marketing capabilities;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors;\n\u00b7\nannouncements of new products, technological innovations or product advancements by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\ndevelopments with respect to patents and other intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7\nsales of common stock or other securities by us or our stockholders in the future;\n\u00b7\nadditions or departures of key scientific or management personnel;\n\u00b7\ndisputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u00b7\nthe trading volume of our common stock;\n\u00b7\nchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts, failure to obtain or maintain analyst coverage of our common stock or our failure to achieve analyst earnings estimates;\n\u00b7\npublic statements by analysts or clinicians regarding their perceptions of our clinical results or the effectiveness of our products;\n\u00b7\ndecreases in market valuations of medical device companies; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral market conditions and other factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors.\nThe stock prices of many companies in the medical device industry have experienced wide fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. Following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation often has been initiated against a company. If class action litigation is initiated against us, we may incur substantial costs and our management\u2019s attention may be diverted from our operations, which could significantly harm our business.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by existing stockholders, or the perception that they may occur, could cause our stock price to decline.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock by us or by our stockholders, announcements of the proposed sales of substantial amounts of our common stock or the perception that substantial sales may be made, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. We may issue additional shares of our common stock in follow-on offerings to raise additional capital, upon the exercise of options or warrants, or in connection with acquisitions or corporate alliances. We also plan to issue additional shares to our employees, directors or consultants in connection with their services to us. All of the currently outstanding shares of our common stock are freely tradable under federal and state securities laws, except for shares held by our directors, officers and certain greater than five percent stockholders, which may be subject to holding period, volume and other limitations under Rule 144. Due to these factors, sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time and could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nWe have a significant number of outstanding warrants, options and shares of convertible preferred stock, some of which contain full-ratchet anti-dilution protection, which may cause significant dilution to our stockholders, have a material adverse impact on the market price of our common stock and make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future equity offerings.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had outstanding 8,770,433 shares of common stock. In addition, as of that date we had outstanding warrants to acquire 15,304,722 shares of common stock, options to acquire 4,225 shares of common stock and shares of convertible preferred stock convertible into an aggregate of 131,743 shares of common stock. The issuance of shares of common stock upon the exercise of warrants or options or conversion of preferred stock would dilute the percentage ownership interest of all stockholders, might dilute the book value per share of our common stock and would increase the number of our publicly traded shares, which could depress the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, a substantial number of our outstanding warrants and shares of convertible preferred stock contain so-called full-ratchet anti-dilution provisions which, subject to limited exceptions, would reduce the exercise price of the warrants (but not increase the number of shares issuable) and reduce the conversion price of the convertible preferred stock (and increase the number of shares issuable) in the event that we in the future issue common stock, or securities\nconvertible into or exercisable to purchase common stock, at a lower price per share, to such lower price. Of our outstanding warrants as of December 31, 2018, warrants exercisable to purchase 41,963 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $1.25 per share contained a full-ratchet anti-dilution provision, and shares of convertible preferred stock convertible into 127,200 shares of common stock at a conversion price of $1.25 per share contained a full-ratchet anti-dilution provision. These full ratchet anti-dilution provisions would be triggered by the future issuances by us of shares of our common stock or common stock equivalents at a price per share below the then-exercise price of the warrants and the then-conversion price of the convertible preferred stock, subject to limited exceptions. In the event of a liquidation, the holders of shares of series C convertible preferred stock are entitled to be paid, before any payments are to be made to the holders of common stock or any other series of preferred stock, an amount per share equal to the greater of (i) $5,772.4254 per share (on an as-converted-to-common stock basis), or an aggregate of approximately $26.2 million, plus any dividends declared but unpaid thereon, or (ii) such amount per share as would have been payable had all shares of series C convertible preferred stock been converted to common stock immediately prior to such liquidation.\nIn addition to the dilutive effects described above, the perceived risk of dilution as a result of the significant number of outstanding warrants, options and shares of convertible preferred stock may cause our common stockholders to be more inclined to sell their shares, which would contribute to a downward movement in the price of our common stock. Moreover, the perceived risk of dilution and the resulting downward pressure on our common stock price could encourage investors to engage in short sales of our common stock, which could further contribute to price declines in our common stock. The fact that our stockholders, warrant holders and option holders can sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, as well as the existence of full-ratchet anti-dilution provisions in a substantial number of our outstanding warrants and shares of convertible preferred stock, could make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through the sale of equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate, or at all.\nYou may experience future dilution as a result of future equity offerings.\nIn order to raise additional capital for general corporate purposes, in the future we may offer additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock at prices that may be lower than the current price per share of our common stock. In addition, investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing stockholders. The price per share at which we sell additional shares of our common stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into common stock, in future transactions may be higher or lower than the price per share paid by investors in prior offerings.\nSince our securities are currently quoted on the OTCQB market, our stockholders may face significant restrictions on the resale of our securities due to state \u201cblue sky\u201d laws.\nEach state has its own securities laws, often called \u201cblue sky\u201d laws, which (i) limit sales of securities to a state\u2019s residents unless the securities are registered in that state or qualify for an exemption from registration, and (ii) govern the reporting requirements for broker-dealers doing business directly or indirectly in the state. Before a security is sold in a state, there must be a registration in place to cover the transaction, or the transaction must be exempt from registration. The applicable broker must be registered in that state. We do not know whether our common stock will be registered or exempt from registration under the laws of any state. Since our common stock is currently quoted on the OTCQB, a determination regarding registration will be made by those broker-dealers, if any, who agree to serve as the market-makers for our common stock. There may be significant state blue sky law restrictions on the ability of investors to sell, and on purchasers to buy, our common stock. Investors should therefore consider the resale market for our common stock to be limited, as they may be unable to resell your common stock without the significant expense of state registration or qualification.\nOur organizational documents and Delaware law make a takeover of our company more difficult, which may prevent certain changes in control and limit the market price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law contain provisions that may have the effect of deterring or delaying attempts by our stockholders to remove or replace management, engage in proxy contests and effect changes in control. These provisions include:\n\u00b7\nthe ability of our board of directors to create and issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to implement anti-takeover devices;\n\u00b7\nthe authority for our board of directors to issue without stockholder approval up to the number of shares of common stock authorized in our certificate of incorporation, that, if issued, would dilute the ownership of our stockholders;\n\u00b7\nthe advance notice requirement for director nominations or for proposals that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings;\n\u00b7\na classified and staggered board of directors, which may make it more difficult for a person who acquires control of a majority of our outstanding voting stock to replace all or a majority of our directors;\n\u00b7\nthe prohibition on actions by written consent of our stockholders;\n\u00b7\nthe limitation on who may call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u00b7\nthe prohibition on stockholders accumulating their votes for the election of directors; and\n\u00b7\nthe ability of stockholders to amend our bylaws only upon receiving a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of all outstanding shares then entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.\nIn addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. In general, Section 203 prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder unless certain specific requirements are met as set forth in Section 203. These provisions, alone or together, could have the effect of deterring or delaying changes in incumbent management, proxy contests or changes in control.\nThese provisions also could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. The existence of these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. Some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may deter third parties from acquiring us, which may limit the market price of our common stock.\nWe have not paid dividends in the past and do not expect to pay dividends in the future, and any return on investment may be limited to the value of our common stock.\nWe have never paid dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends on our common stock will depend on our earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting us at such time as our board of directors may consider relevant. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because a return on your investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates.", "PERMNO": 92433, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "RSLS"}
