{"cik": "1486159", "company": "Oasis Petroleum Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business involves a high degree of risk. If any of the following risks, or any risk described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could suffer. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks not presently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial also may adversely affect us.\nRisks related to the crude oil and natural gas industry and our business\nA substantial or extended decline in commodity prices, in crude oil and, to a lesser extent, natural gas and NGL prices may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations and financial commitments.\nThe price we receive for our crude oil and, to a lesser extent, natural gas and NGLs, heavily influences our revenue, profitability, access to capital and future rate of growth. Crude oil, natural gas and NGLs are commodities and, therefore, their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. Historically, the market for crude oil, natural gas and NGL has been volatile. For example, average daily prices for NYMEX WTI crude oil ranged from a high of $66.24 per barrel to a low of $46.31 per barrel during 2019. Average daily prices for NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas ranged from a high of $4.25 per MMBtu to a low of $1.75 per MMBtu during 2019. Likewise, NGLs, which are made up of ethane, propane, isobutane, normal butane and natural gasoline, each of which have different uses and different pricing characteristics, have experienced significant declines in realized prices since the fall of 2014. These markets will likely continue to be volatile in the future. The prices we receive for our production, and the levels of our production, depend on numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include the following:\n\u2022worldwide and regional economic conditions impacting the global supply and demand for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs;\n\u2022the actions of OPEC;\n\u2022the price and quantity of imports of foreign crude oil, natural gas and NGL;\n\u2022political conditions in or affecting other crude oil, natural gas and NGL producing countries, including the current conflicts in the Middle East and conditions in South America, China, India and Russia;\n\u2022the level of global crude oil, natural gas and NGL E&P activities;\n\u2022the level of global crude oil, natural gas and NGL inventories;\n\u2022events that impact global market demand, including impacts from global health epidemics and concerns, such as the coronavirus;\n\u2022localized supply and demand fundamentals and regional, domestic and international transportation availability;\n\u2022weather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u2022domestic and foreign governmental regulations and policies, including environmental requirements;\n\u2022speculation as to the future price of crude oil and the speculative trading of crude oil and natural gas futures contracts;\n\u2022stockholder activism or activities by non-governmental organizations to limit certain sources of funding for the energy sector or restrict the exploration, development and production of crude oil, natural gas and NGL and related infrastructure;\n\u2022price and availability of competitors\u2019 supplies of crude oil, natural gas and NGL;\n\u2022technological advances affecting energy consumption; and\n\u2022the price and availability of alternative fuels.\nSubstantially all of our crude oil and natural gas production is sold to purchasers under short-term (less than twelve-month) contracts at market-based prices, and our NGL production is sold to purchasers under long-term (more than twelve-month) contracts at market-based prices. Low crude oil, natural gas and NGL prices will reduce our cash flows, borrowing ability, the present value of our reserves and our ability to develop future reserves. See \u201cOur exploration, development and exploitation projects require substantial capital expenditures. We may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, which could lead to expiration of our leases or a decline in our estimated net crude oil and natural gas reserves\u201d below. Low crude oil, natural gas and NGL prices may also reduce the amount of crude oil, natural gas and NGL that we can produce economically and may affect our proved reserves. See also \u201cThe present value of future net revenues from our estimated net proved reserves will not necessarily be the same as the current market value of our estimated crude oil and natural gas reserves\u201d below.\nIncreased costs of capital could adversely affect our business.\nOur business and operating results can be harmed by factors such as the availability, terms and cost of capital, increases in interest rates or a reduction in credit rating. Changes in any one or more of these factors could cause our cost of doing business to increase, limit our access to capital, limit our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities, reduce our cash flows available for drilling and place us at a competitive disadvantage. Recent and continuing disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets may lead to an increase in interest rates or a contraction in credit availability impacting our ability to finance our operations. We require continued access to capital. A significant reduction in the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve our planned operating results.\nWe may not be able to generate enough cash flows to meet our debt obligations.\nWe expect our earnings and cash flows to vary significantly from year to year due to the nature of our industry. As a result, the amount of debt that we can manage in some periods may not be appropriate for us in other periods. Additionally, our future cash flows may be insufficient to meet our debt obligations and other commitments. Any insufficiency could negatively impact our business. A range of economic, competitive, business and industry factors will affect our future financial performance, and, as a result, our ability to generate cash flows from operations and to pay our debt obligations. Many of these factors, such as crude oil, natural gas and NGL prices, economic and financial conditions in our industry and the global economy and initiatives of our competitors, are beyond our control. If we do not generate enough cash flows from operations to satisfy our debt obligations, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as:\n\u2022selling assets;\n\u2022reducing or delaying capital investments;\n\u2022seeking to raise additional capital; or\n\u2022refinancing or restructuring our debt.\nIf for any reason we are unable to meet our debt service and repayment obligations, we would be in default under the terms of the agreements governing our debt, which would allow our creditors at that time to declare all outstanding indebtedness to be due and payable, which would in turn trigger cross-acceleration or cross-default rights between the relevant agreements. In addition, our lenders could compel us to apply all of our available cash to repay our borrowings or they could prevent us from making payments on our Notes (as defined in \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d). If amounts outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facilities or our Notes were to be accelerated, we cannot be certain that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full the money owed to the lenders or to our other debt holders. Please see \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nOur Revolving Credit Facilities and the indentures governing our Senior Notes all contain operating and financial restrictions that may restrict our business and financing activities.\nOur Revolving Credit Facilities and the indentures governing our Senior Notes (as defined in \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d) contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022sell assets, including equity interests in our subsidiaries;\n\u2022pay distributions on, redeem or repurchase our common stock or redeem or repurchase our debt;\n\u2022make investments;\n\u2022incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock;\n\u2022create or incur certain liens;\n\u2022make certain acquisitions and investments;\n\u2022redeem or prepay other debt;\n\u2022enter into agreements that restrict distributions or other payments from our restricted subsidiaries to us;\n\u2022consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022engage in transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022create unrestricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022enter into sale and leaseback transactions; and\n\u2022engage in certain business activities.\nAs a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs.\nOur ability to comply with some of the covenants and restrictions contained in our Revolving Credit Facilities and the indentures governing our Senior Notes may be affected by events beyond our control. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate or if crude oil, natural gas and NGL prices decline substantially or for an extended period of time from their current levels, our ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. A failure to comply with the covenants, ratios or tests in our Revolving Credit Facilities, the indentures governing our Senior Notes or any future indebtedness could result in an event of default under our Revolving Credit Facilities, the indentures governing our Senior Notes or our future indebtedness, which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf an event of default under either of our Revolving Credit Facilities occurs and remains uncured, the lenders under the applicable Revolving Credit Facility:\n\u2022would not be required to lend any additional amounts to us;\n\u2022could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be due and payable;\n\u2022may have the ability to require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings; or\n\u2022may prevent us from making debt service payments under our other agreements.\nA payment default or an acceleration under our Revolving Credit Facilities could result in an event of default and an acceleration under the indentures for our Notes. If the indebtedness under the Notes were to be accelerated, there can be no assurance that we would have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to repay such indebtedness in full. In addition, our obligations under the Oasis Credit Facility are collateralized by perfected first priority liens and security interests on substantially all of our oil and gas assets, including mortgage liens on oil and gas properties having at least 90% of the reserve value as determined by reserve reports, and if we are unable to repay our indebtedness under the Oasis Credit Facility, the lenders could seek to foreclose on our assets. OMP\u2019s obligations under the OMP Credit Facility are collateralized by mortgages and other security interests on substantially all of OMP\u2019s and its subsidiaries\u2019 properties and assets, including the equity interests in all present and future subsidiaries (subject to certain exceptions). Some or all of the collateral owned by Bobcat DevCo and Beartooth DevCo is subject to an intercreditor agreement between Wells Fargo, National Association (\u201cWells Fargo\u201d), as administrative agent for the OMP Credit Facility, and Wells Fargo as the administrative agent for the Oasis Credit Facility, and acknowledged by OMS, Bobcat DevCo and Beartooth DevCo. If OMP is unable to repay its indebtedness under the OMP Credit Facility, the lenders could seek to foreclose on OMP\u2019s assets. However, there are no cross-default rights between the Revolving Credit Facilities. Therefore, an acceleration of the OMP Credit Facility will not trigger automatically an acceleration of the Oasis Credit Facility. Please see \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nOur level of indebtedness may increase and reduce our financial flexibility.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $337.0 million of outstanding borrowings and had $15.1 million of outstanding letters of credit under the Oasis Credit Facility, $458.5 million of outstanding borrowings and had $1.7 million of outstanding letters of credit under the OMP Credit Facility, $862.7 million available for future secured borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facilities and $1,982.6 million outstanding in Notes. Please see \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Senior secured revolving line of credit,\u201d \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Senior unsecured notes\u201d and \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Senior unsecured convertible notes.\u201d In the future, we may incur significant indebtedness in order to make future acquisitions or to develop our properties.\nOur level of indebtedness could affect our operations in several ways, including the following:\n\u2022a significant portion of our cash flows could be used to service our indebtedness;\n\u2022a high level of debt would increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022the covenants contained in the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness limit our ability to borrow additional funds, dispose of assets, pay dividends and make certain investments;\n\u2022our debt covenants may also affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in the economy and in our industry;\n\u2022a high level of debt may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged and therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our indebtedness would prevent us from pursuing;\n\u2022a high level of debt may make it more likely that a reduction in our borrowing base following a periodic redetermination could require us to repay a portion of our then-outstanding bank borrowings; and\n\u2022a high level of debt may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes.\nA high level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations. Our ability to meet our debt obligations and to reduce our level of indebtedness depends on our future performance. General economic conditions, crude oil, natural gas and NGL prices and financial, business and other factors affect our operations and our future performance. Many of these factors are beyond our control. If crude oil, natural gas and NGL prices decline substantially or for an extended period of time from their current levels, we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to pay the interest on our debt and future working capital, and borrowings or equity financing may not be available to pay or refinance such debt. Factors that will affect our ability to raise cash through an offering of our capital stock or a refinancing of our debt include financial market conditions, the value of our assets and our performance at the time we need capital.\nIn addition, the Oasis Credit Facility borrowing base is subject to periodic redeterminations. We could be forced to repay a portion of our bank borrowings under the Oasis Credit Facility due to redeterminations of our borrowing base. If we are forced to do so, we may not have sufficient funds to make such repayments. If we do not have sufficient funds and are otherwise unable to negotiate renewals of our borrowings or arrange new financing, we may have to sell significant assets. Any such sale could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nOur derivative activities could result in financial losses or could reduce our income.\nTo achieve more predictable cash flows and to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in the prices of crude oil and natural gas, we currently, and may in the future, enter into derivative arrangements for a portion of our crude oil and natural gas production, including collars and fixed-price swaps. We have not designated any of our derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes and record all derivative instruments on our balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments are recognized in earnings. Accordingly, our earnings may fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments.\nDerivative arrangements also expose us to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when:\n\u2022production is less than the volume covered by the derivative instruments;\n\u2022the counterparty to the derivative instrument defaults on its contract obligations; or\n\u2022there is an increase in the differential between the underlying price in the derivative instrument and actual price received.\nIn addition, some of these types of derivative arrangements limit the benefit we would receive from increases in the prices for crude oil and natural gas and may expose us to cash margin requirements.\nDrilling for and producing crude oil and natural gas are high-risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur future financial condition and results of operations will depend on the success of our exploitation, exploration, development and production activities. Our crude oil and natural gas E&P activities are subject to numerous risks beyond our control, including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable crude oil or natural gas production. Our decisions to purchase, explore, develop or otherwise exploit drilling locations or properties will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses, production data and engineering studies, the results of which are often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations. For a discussion of the uncertainty involved in these processes, see \u201cOur estimated net proved reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any significant inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves\u201d below. Our cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain before drilling commences. These levels of uncertainty may be increased with respect to our recently acquired positions in the Delaware Basin due to our inexperience operating in the area. See \u201cThe Permian Basin Acquisition in 2018 represented our initial expansion outside of the Williston Basin, and we may encounter new obstacles operating in different geographic regions\u201d below. Overruns in planned expenditures are common risks that can make a particular project uneconomical. Further, many factors may curtail, delay or cancel our scheduled drilling projects, including the following:\n\u2022shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment and qualified personnel;\n\u2022facility or equipment malfunctions and/or failure;\n\u2022unexpected operational events, including accidents;\n\u2022pressure or irregularities in geological formations;\n\u2022adverse weather conditions, such as blizzards, ice storms and floods;\n\u2022reductions in crude oil, natural gas and NGL prices;\n\u2022delays imposed by or resulting from compliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u2022proximity to and capacity of transportation facilities;\n\u2022title problems; and\n\u2022limitations in the market for crude oil and natural gas.\nOur estimated net proved reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any significant inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\nThe process of estimating crude oil and natural gas reserves is complex. It requires interpretations of available technical data and many assumptions, including assumptions relating to current and future economic conditions and commodity prices. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves shown in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Our operations - exploration and production activities\u201d for information about our estimated crude oil and natural gas reserves and the PV-10 and Standardized Measure of discounted future net revenues as of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nIn order to prepare our estimates, we must project production rates and the timing of development expenditures. We must also analyze available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data. The extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary. The process also requires economic assumptions about matters such as crude oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. Although the reserve information contained herein is reviewed by our independent reserve engineers, estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves are inherently imprecise.\nActual future production, crude oil and natural gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves will vary from our estimates. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves shown in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, we may adjust estimates of net proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development, prevailing crude oil and natural gas prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Due to the limited production history of our undeveloped acreage, the estimates of future production associated with such properties may be subject to greater variance to actual production than would be the case with properties having a longer production history.\nThe present value of future net revenues from our estimated net proved reserves will not necessarily be the same as the current market value of our estimated crude oil and natural gas reserves.\nYou should not assume that the present value of future net revenues from our estimated net proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated net crude oil and natural gas reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we based the estimated discounted future net revenues from our estimated net proved reserves on the twelve-month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for the preceding twelve months without giving effect to derivative transactions. Actual future net revenues from our oil and gas properties will be affected by factors such as:\n\u2022actual prices we receive for crude oil and natural gas;\n\u2022actual cost of development and production expenditures;\n\u2022the amount and timing of actual production; and\n\u2022changes in governmental regulations or taxation.\nThe timing of both our production and our incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of oil and gas properties will affect the timing and amount of actual future net revenues from estimated net proved reserves, and thus their actual present value. In addition, the 10% discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net revenues may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the crude oil and natural gas industry in general.\nActual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the present value estimates included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any significant future price changes will have a material effect on the quantity and present value of our estimated net proved reserves.\nIf crude oil, natural gas and NGL prices decline substantially or for an extended period of time from their current levels, we may be required to take write-downs of the carrying values of our oil and gas properties.\nWe review our proved oil and gas properties for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the recoverability of their carrying value may have occurred. In addition, we assess our unproved properties periodically for impairment on a property-by-property basis based on remaining lease terms, drilling results or future plans to develop acreage. Based on specific market factors and circumstances at the time of prospective impairment reviews, and the continuing evaluation of development plans, production data, economics and other factors, we may be required to write down the carrying value of our oil and gas properties, which may result in a decrease in the amount available under our Revolving Credit Facilities. A write-down constitutes a non-cash charge to earnings. A substantial or extended decline in crude oil, natural gas and NGL prices may cause us to incur impairment charges in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to borrow under our Revolving Credit Facilities and our results of operations for the periods in which such charges are taken. Due to the volatility of expected future crude oil prices, we reviewed our proved oil and gas properties for impairment as of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2017, no impairment was recorded on our proved oil and gas properties. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded an impairment loss of $383.4 million to adjust the carrying value of certain non-strategic proved and unproved oil and gas properties held for sale to their estimated fair value, determined based on the expected sales price less costs to sell. During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $5.4 million, $0.9 million and $6.9 million, respectively, on our unproved properties due to expiring leases, periodic assessments and drilling plan uncertainty on certain acreage of our unproved properties.\nThe unavailability or high cost of additional drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel and oilfield services or the unavailability of sufficient transportation for our production could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans within our budget and on a timely basis.\nOur industry is cyclical and, from time to time, there is a shortage of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies or qualified personnel. During these periods, the costs of rigs, equipment, supplies and personnel are substantially greater and their availability to us may be limited. Additionally, these services may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.\nShortages or the high cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel or oilfield services or the unavailability of sufficient transportation for our production could delay or adversely affect our development and exploration operations or cause us to incur significant expenditures that are not provided for in our capital plan, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, compliance with new or emerging legal requirements that affect midstream operations in North Dakota or Texas may reduce the availability of transportation for our production. For example, the NDIC adopted regulations in late 2013 that impose more rigorous pipeline development standards on midstream operators, some of whom we rely on to construct and operate pipeline infrastructure to transport the crude oil and natural gas we produce.\nPart of our strategic tactics involve drilling in existing or emerging shale plays using some of the latest available horizontal drilling and completion techniques. The results of our planned drilling in these plays are subject to drilling and completion technique risks and drilling results may not meet our expectations for reserves or production. As a result, we may incur material write-downs and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline if drilling results are unsuccessful.\nOur operations involve utilizing the latest drilling and completion techniques as developed by us and our service providers in order to maximize cumulative recoveries and therefore generate the highest possible returns. Risks that we face while drilling include, but are not limited to, landing our well bore in the desired drilling zone, staying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation, running our casing the entire length of the well bore and being able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal well bore. Risks that we face while completing our wells include, but are not limited to, being able to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages, being able to run tools the entire length of the well bore during completion operations, successfully cleaning out the well bore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage and successfully protecting nearby producing wells from the impact of fracture stimulation.\nUltimately, the success of these drilling and completion techniques can only be evaluated over time as more wells are drilled and production profiles are established over a sufficiently long time period. If our drilling results are less than anticipated or we are unable to execute our drilling program because of capital constraints, lease expirations, access to gathering systems and limited takeaway capacity or otherwise, and/or crude oil, natural gas and NGL prices decline, the return on our investment in these areas may not be as attractive as we anticipate. We could incur material write-downs of unevaluated properties, and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future.\nOur exploration, development and exploitation projects require substantial capital expenditures. We may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, which could lead to expiration of our leases or a decline in our estimated net crude oil and natural gas reserves.\nOur exploration and development activities are capital intensive. We make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our business for the development, exploitation, production and acquisition of crude oil and natural gas reserves. Excluding acquisitions of $21.0 million in 2019 and $951.9 million in 2018, we spent $822.4 million and $1,251.6 million related to capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our total capital expenditure plan for 2020 is approximately $685 million to $715 million, which includes approximately $575 million to $595 million for E&P and other capital expenditures, including approximately $316 million to $387 million focused in the Williston Basin and approximately $201 million to $268 million focused in the Delaware Basin (with approximately 80-90% of the E&P capital allocated to drilling and completions). Other capital expenditures includes administrative capital, and excludes capitalized interest of approximately $12.5 million. Since our initial public offering, our capital expenditures have been financed with proceeds from public equity offerings, proceeds from our issuance of senior notes, borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facilities, net cash provided by operating activities, the sale of non-strategic oil and gas properties and cash settlements of derivative contracts. DeGolyer and MacNaughton projects that we will incur capital costs of $1,375.0 million over the next five years to develop the proved undeveloped reserves in the Williston Basin and the Delaware Basin covered by its December 31, 2019 reserve report. Additionally, OMP will continue to invest in midstream assets to support our E&P business segment as well as third-party customers. The actual amount and timing of our future capital expenditures may differ materially from our estimates as a result of, among other things, commodity prices, actual drilling results, the availability of drilling rigs and other services and equipment, and regulatory, technological and competitive developments.\nA significant increase in product prices could result in an increase in our capital expenditures. We intend to finance our future capital expenditures primarily through cash flows provided by operating activities, borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facilities and cash settlements of derivative contracts; however, our financing needs may require us to alter or increase our capitalization substantially through the issuance of additional debt or equity securities or the sale of non-strategic assets. The issuance of additional debt or equity may require that a portion of our cash flows provided by operating activities be used for the payment of principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing our ability to use cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions. The issuance of additional equity securities could have a dilutive effect on the value of our common stock. In addition, upon the issuance of certain debt securities (other than on a borrowing base redetermination date), our borrowing base under the Oasis Credit Facility will be automatically reduced by an amount equal to 25% of the aggregate principal amount of such debt securities.\nOur cash flows provided by operating activities and access to capital are subject to a number of variables, including:\n\u2022our estimated net proved reserves;\n\u2022the level of crude oil, natural gas and NGL we are able to produce from existing wells and new projected wells;\n\u2022the prices at which our crude oil, natural gas and NGL are sold;\n\u2022the costs of developing and producing our crude oil and natural gas production;\n\u2022our ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves;\n\u2022the ability and willingness of our banks to lend; and\n\u2022our ability to access the equity and debt capital markets.\nIf the borrowing base under our Revolving Credit Facilities or our revenues decrease as a result of low crude oil, natural gas or NGL prices, operating difficulties, declines in reserves or for any other reason, we may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations at current levels. If additional capital is needed, we may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms favorable to us, or at all. If cash generated by operations or cash available under our Revolving Credit Facilities is not sufficient to meet our capital requirements, the failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of our operations relating to development of our drilling locations, which in turn could lead to a possible expiration of our leases and a decline in our estimated net proved reserves, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe will not be the operator on all of our drilling locations, and, therefore, we will not be able to control the timing of exploration or development efforts, associated costs, or the rate of production of any non-operated assets.\nWe may enter into arrangements with respect to existing or future drilling locations that result in a greater proportion of our locations being operated by others. As a result, we may have limited ability to exercise influence over the operations of the drilling locations operated by our partners. Dependence on the operator could prevent us from realizing our target returns for those locations. The success and timing of exploration and development activities operated by our partners will depend on a number of factors that will be largely outside of our control, including:\n\u2022the timing and amount of capital expenditures;\n\u2022the operator\u2019s expertise and financial resources;\n\u2022approval of other participants in drilling wells;\n\u2022selection of technology; and\n\u2022the rate of production of reserves, if any.\nThis limited ability to exercise control over the operations of some of our drilling locations may cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAll of our producing properties and operations are located in the Williston Basin and the Delaware Basin regions, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating among a limited number of geographic areas.\nAs of December 31, 2019, 92% of our production was located in the Williston Basin in northwestern North Dakota and northeastern Montana and the remaining 8% of our production was located in the Delaware Basin in west Texas. As a result, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of economics in the Williston Basin and the Delaware Basin or delays or interruptions of production from those wells caused by transportation capacity constraints, curtailment of production, availability of equipment, facilities, personnel or services, significant governmental regulation, natural disasters, adverse weather conditions, plant closures for scheduled maintenance or interruption of transportation of crude oil or natural gas produced from the wells in those areas. In addition, the effect of fluctuations on supply and demand may become more pronounced within specific geographic crude oil and natural gas producing areas such as the Williston Basin and the Delaware Basin, which may cause these conditions to occur with greater frequency or magnify the effect of these conditions. Due to the concentrated nature of our portfolio of properties, a number of our properties could experience any of the same conditions at the same time, resulting in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other companies that have a more diversified portfolio of properties. Such delays or interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Permian Basin Acquisition in 2018 represented our initial expansion outside of the Williston Basin, and we may encounter new obstacles operating in different geographic regions.\nOur operations have historically focused on a single geographic region, namely the North Dakota and Montana regions of the Williston Basin. The Permian Basin Acquisition represents our initial entry into the Delaware Basin, and our first expansion of our operations outside of the Williston Basin. Certain aspects related to operating in the Delaware Basin may not be as familiar to us as our Williston Basin project areas. As a result, we may encounter obstacles that may cause us not to achieve the expected results of the Permian Basin Acquisition and subsequent bolt-on acquisitions. These obstacles may include a less familiar geological landscape, different completion techniques, midstream and downstream operators with whom we have no established relationship, greater competition for acreage, unfamiliar operating conditions and a distinct regulatory environment. Any adverse conditions, regulations or developments related to our expansion into the Delaware Basin may have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business depends on crude oil and natural gas gathering and transportation facilities, some of which are owned by third parties.\nThe marketability of our crude oil and natural gas production depends in part on the availability, proximity and capacity of gathering and pipeline systems owned by midstream operators, including third parties and by OMP. The unavailability of, or lack of, available capacity on these systems and facilities could result in the shut-in of producing wells, the flaring of natural gas that could result in restrictions on production or monetary sanctions, or the delay, or discontinuance of, development plans for properties. See also \u201cMarket conditions or operational impediments may hinder our access to crude oil, natural gas and NGLs markets or delay our production\u201d and \u201cInsufficient transportation, end-market refining utilization or natural gas processing capacity in the Williston Basin and the Delaware Basin could cause significant fluctuations in our realized crude oil and natural gas prices\u201d below. The transportation of our production can be interrupted by other customers that have firm arrangements. In addition, these midstream operators may also impose specifications for the products that they are willing to accept. If the total mix of a product fails to meet the applicable product quality specifications, the midstream operators may refuse to accept all or a part of the products or may invoice us for the costs to handle or damages from receiving the out-of-specification products. In those circumstances, we may be required to delay the delivery of or find alternative markets for that product, or shut-in the producing wells that are causing the products to be out of specification, potentially reducing our revenues.\nThe disruption of midstream operators\u2019 facilities due to maintenance, weather or other interruptions of service could also negatively impact our ability to market and deliver our products. We have no control over when or if such facilities are restored. A total shut-in of our production could materially affect us due to a resulting lack of cash flows, and if a substantial portion of the production is hedged at lower than market prices, those financial hedges would have to be paid from borrowings absent\nsufficient cash flows. Potential crude oil or NGL train derailments or crashes as well as state or federal restrictions on the vapor pressure of crude oil transported by, or loaded on or unloaded from, railcars could also impact our ability to market and deliver our products and cause significant fluctuations in our realized crude oil and natural gas prices due to tighter safety regulations imposed on crude-by-rail transportation and interruptions in service.\nInsufficient transportation, end-market refining utilization or natural gas processing capacity in the Williston Basin and the Delaware Basin could cause significant fluctuations in our realized crude oil and natural gas prices.\nThe crude oil business environment has historically been characterized by periods when crude oil production has surpassed local transportation and refining capacity, resulting in substantial discounts in the price received for crude oil versus prices quoted for NYMEX WTI crude oil. In the past, there have been periods when this discount has substantially increased due to the production of crude oil in the area increasing to a point that it temporarily surpasses the available pipeline transportation, rail transportation and refining capacity in the area. Expansions of both rail and pipeline facilities have reduced the prior constraint on crude oil transportation out of the Williston Basin and the Delaware Basin and improved basin differentials received at the lease. On barrels that we transport and sell outside of the basins, our realized price for crude oil is generally the quoted price at the point of sale less transportation costs. In the fourth quarter of 2019, as production increased and existing pipelines in the Williston Basin were again running at peak rates, rail transportation increased and our Williston Basin price differentials relative to NYMEX WTI widened to more than $3.50 per barrel below NYMEX WTI. In the first half of 2019, our Delaware Basin price differentials relative to NYMEX WTI weakened due to transportation capacity restraints, averaging more than $5.00 per barrel below NYMEX WTI. However, expansions of pipelines began to occur in mid-2019 which greatly reduced these differentials, which became positive to NYMEX WTI by year-end.\nMarket conditions or operational impediments may hinder our access to crude oil, natural gas and NGLs markets or delay our production.\nMarket conditions or the unavailability of satisfactory crude oil and natural gas transportation arrangements may hinder our access to crude oil and natural gas markets or delay our production. The availability of a ready market for our crude oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors, including the demand for and supply of crude oil and natural gas and the proximity of reserves to pipelines and terminal facilities. Our ability to market our production depends, in substantial part, on the availability and capacity of gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities owned and operated by midstream operators. Our failure to obtain such services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business. We may be required to shut in wells due to lack of a market or inadequacy or unavailability of crude oil or natural gas pipelines or gathering system capacity. If our production becomes shut-in for any of these or other reasons, we would be unable to realize revenue from those wells until other arrangements were made to deliver the products to market.\nOur crude oil, natural gas and NGLs are sold in a limited number of geographic markets so an oversupply in any of those areas could have a material negative effect on the price we receive.\nOur crude oil, natural gas and NGLs are sold in a limited number of geographic markets and each has a generally fixed amount of storage and processing capacity. As a result, if such markets become oversupplied with crude oil, natural gas and/or NGLs, it could have a material negative effect on the prices we receive for our products and therefore an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Variances in quality may also cause differences in the value received for our products. Additionally, the refining capacity in the U.S. Gulf Coast is insufficient to refine all of the light sweet crude oil being produced in the United States. The United States imports heavy crude oil and exports light crude oil to utilize the U.S. Gulf Coast refineries that have more heavy refining capacity. If light sweet crude oil production remains at current levels or continues to increase, demand for our light crude oil production could result in widening price discounts to the world crude prices and potential shut in or reduction of production due to a lack of sufficient markets despite the lift on prior restrictions on the exporting of crude oil and natural gas from the United States.\nThe development of our proved undeveloped reserves in the Williston Basin, Delaware Basin and other areas of operation may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate. Therefore, our undeveloped reserves may not be ultimately developed or produced.\nApproximately 42% of our estimated net proved reserves were classified as proved undeveloped as of December 31, 2019. Development of these reserves may take longer and require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate. The future development of our proved undeveloped reserves is dependent on future commodity prices, costs and economic assumptions that align with our internal forecasts as well as access to liquidity sources, such as capital markets, our Revolving Credit Facilities and derivative contracts. Delays in the development of our reserves or increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves will reduce the PV-10 value of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves and future net revenues estimated for such reserves and may result in some projects becoming uneconomic. In addition, delays in the development of reserves could cause us to have to reclassify our proved reserves as unproved reserves.\nUnless we replace our crude oil and natural gas reserves, our reserves and production will decline, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnless we conduct successful development, exploitation and exploration activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, our estimated net proved reserves will decline as those reserves are produced. Producing oil and natural gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Our future crude oil and natural gas reserves and production, and therefore our cash flows and income, are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing and exploiting our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. We may not be able to develop, exploit, find or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs. If we are unable to replace our current and future production, the value of our reserves will decrease, and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nWe may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of our operations. Additionally, we may not be insured for, or our insurance may be inadequate to protect us against, these risks.\nWe are not insured against all risks. Additionally, certain of our insurance policies also provide coverage to OMP and as a result, a claim by OMP against one of our shared insurance policies may reduce the remaining amount of coverage available to us. Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured and underinsured events could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our crude oil and natural gas E&P activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing crude oil and natural gas, including the possibility of:\n\u2022environmental hazards, such as natural gas leaks, crude oil and produced water spills, pipeline and tank ruptures, encountering naturally occurring radioactive materials and unauthorized discharges of brine, well stimulation and completion fluids, toxic gas, such as hydrogen sulfide, or other pollutants into the environment;\n\u2022abnormally pressured formations;\n\u2022shortages of, or delays in, obtaining water for hydraulic fracturing activities;\n\u2022mechanical difficulties, such as stuck oilfield drilling and service tools and casing failure;\n\u2022personal injuries and death; and\n\u2022natural disasters.\nAny of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial losses to us as a result of:\n\u2022injury or loss of life;\n\u2022damage to and destruction of property, natural resources and equipment;\n\u2022pollution and other environmental damage;\n\u2022regulatory investigations and penalties;\n\u2022suspension of our operations; and\n\u2022repair and remediation costs.\nInsurance against all operational risk is not available to us. We are not fully insured against all risks, including development and completion risks that are generally not recoverable from third parties or insurance. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. Also, we may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. The occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have incurred losses in 2019 and prior years and may do so again in the future.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we incurred a net loss of $128.2 million and $35.3 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we incurred a pre-tax loss of $75.9 million, but had a positive net income after taxes primarily due to the income tax benefit related to the tax rate change under the Tax Act. Our development of and participation in an increasingly larger number of drilling locations has required and will continue to require substantial capital expenditures, including planned capital expenditures for 2020 of approximately $685 million to $715 million.\nThe uncertainty and risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may impede our ability to economically find, develop, exploit and acquire crude oil and natural gas reserves. As a result, we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability or positive cash flows provided by operating activities in the future.\nDrilling locations that we decide to drill may not yield crude oil or natural gas in commercially viable quantities.\nOur drilling locations are in various stages of evaluation, ranging from a location which is ready to drill to a location that will require substantial additional interpretation. There is no way to predict in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular location will yield crude oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to recover drilling or completion costs or to be economically viable. The use of technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area will not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling whether crude oil or natural gas will be present or, if present, whether crude oil or natural gas will be present in sufficient quantities to be economically viable. Even if sufficient amounts of crude oil or natural gas exist, we may damage the potentially productive hydrocarbon bearing formation or experience mechanical difficulties while drilling or completing the well, resulting in a reduction in production from the well or abandonment of the well. If we drill additional wells that we identify as dry holes in our current and future drilling locations, our drilling success rate may decline and materially harm our business. We cannot assure you that the analogies we draw from available data from other wells, more fully explored locations or producing fields will be applicable to our drilling locations. Further, initial production rates reported by us or other operators in the Williston Basin and the Delaware Basin may not be indicative of future or long-term production rates. In sum, the cost of drilling, completing and operating any well is often uncertain, and new wells may not be productive.\nOur potential drilling location inventories are scheduled to be drilled over several years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling. In addition, we may not be able to raise the substantial amount of capital that would be necessary to drill a substantial portion of our potential drilling locations.\nOur management has identified and scheduled drilling locations as an estimation of our future multi-year drilling activities on our existing acreage. These potential drilling locations, including those without proved undeveloped reserves, represent a significant part of our execution strategy. Our ability to drill and develop these locations is subject to a number of uncertainties, including the availability of capital, seasonal conditions, regulatory approvals, crude oil and natural gas prices, costs and drilling results. These levels of uncertainty may be increased with respect to our recently acquired positions in the Delaware Basin due to our inexperience operating in the area. See \u201cThe Permian Basin Acquisition in 2018 represented our initial expansion outside of the Williston Basin, and we may encounter new obstacles operating in different geographic regions\u201d above. Because of these uncertainties, we do not know if the numerous potential drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce crude oil or natural gas from these or any other potential drilling locations. Pursuant to existing SEC rules and guidance, subject to limited exceptions, proved undeveloped reserves may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of booking. These rules and guidance may limit our potential to book additional proved undeveloped reserves as we pursue our drilling program.\nCertain of our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage, the primary term is extended through continuous drilling provisions or the leases are renewed. In the highly competitive market for acreage, failure to drill sufficient wells in order to hold acreage will result in a substantial lease renewal cost, or if renewal is not feasible, loss of our lease and prospective drilling opportunities.\nAs of December 31, 2019, approximately 97% and 71% of our total net acreage in the Williston Basin and the Delaware Basin, respectively, was held by production. The leases for our net acreage not held by production will expire at the end of their primary term unless production is established in paying quantities under the units containing these leases, the leases are held beyond their primary terms under continuous drilling provisions or the leases are renewed. In the Williston Basin, our acreage must be drilled before lease expiration, generally within three to five years, in order to hold the acreage by production. Unless production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres on which some of the locations are identified, the leases for such acreage will expire. In the Delaware Basin, our acreage must be drilled before lease or term assignment expiration and, in some leases, must be further perpetuated via additional drilling activity to satisfy continuous drilling and development provisions. Additionally, certain leases and term assignments in the Delaware Basin require development at various depths in order to perpetuate our ownership as to those depths. As of December 31, 2019, we had 8,809 net acres expiring in 2020, 2,536 net acres expiring in 2021 and 797 net acres expiring in 2022 in the Williston Basin and the Delaware Basin. The cost to renew such leases may increase significantly and we may not be able to renew such leases on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, on certain portions of our acreage, third-party leases become immediately effective if our leases expire. Our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including crude oil and natural gas prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, drilling results, lease expirations, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints, access to and availability of water sourcing and distribution systems, regulatory approvals and other factors. As such, our actual drilling activities may materially differ from our current expectations, which could adversely affect our business. During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $5.4 million, $0.9 million and $6.9 million, respectively, on our unproved properties due to expiring leases, periodic assessments and drilling plan uncertainty on certain acreage of our unproved properties.\nOur operations are subject to environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities.\nOur crude oil and natural gas E&P operations, midstream operations, well servicing operations and related operations are subject to stringent federal, tribal, regional, state and local laws and regulations governing occupational health and safety aspects, the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations that are applicable to our operations and services including the acquisition of a permit before conducting drilling, providing midstream services or other regulated activities; the restriction on types, quantities and concentration of materials that may be released into the environment; the limitation or prohibition of drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; the application of specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection; and the imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations. Numerous governmental authorities, such as the EPA and OSHA, and analogous state agencies have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them, which may cause us to incur significant capital or operating expenditures or costly actions to achieve and maintain compliance. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil or criminal penalties; the imposition of investigatory, remedial or corrective action obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures; the occurrence of restrictions, delays or cancellations in the permitting or development or expansion of projects; and the issuance of injunctions limiting or preventing some or all of our operations in affected areas.\nOur operations risk incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities as a result of our handling of petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes, because of air emissions and waste water discharges related to our operations and due to historical industry operations and waste disposal practices. Under certain environmental laws and regulations, we could be subject to joint and several, strict liability for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination regardless of whether we were responsible for the release or contamination or if the operations were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. Private parties, including the owners of properties upon which our wells are drilled or processing facilities or pipelines are located and facilities where our petroleum hydrocarbons or wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal, may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property or natural resource damage. In addition, accidental spills or other releases could expose us to significant costs and liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in delayed, restricted or more stringent or costly well drilling, plant or pipeline construction, completion or water management activities or waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to attain and maintain compliance and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our own results of operations, competitive position or financial condition. For example, in 2015, the EPA issued a final rule lowering the NAAQS for ground-level ozone to 70 parts per billion for the 8-hour primary and secondary ozone standards. Since that time, the EPA has issued area designations with respect to ground-level ozone and has issued final requirements that apply to state, local and tribal air agencies for implementing the 2015 NAAQS. State implementation of these revised NAAQS standards could result in stricter permitting requirements, delay or prohibit our ability to obtain such permits, and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant. Compliance with any of these rules or any other new or amended legal requirements could, among other things, require installation of new emission controls on some of our equipment, result in longer permitting timelines, and significantly increase our capital expenditures and operating costs, which could adversely impact our business.\nWe may not be able to recover some or any of these costs from insurance.\nFailure to comply with federal, state and local laws could adversely affect our ability to produce, gather and transport our crude oil and natural gas and may result in substantial penalties.\nOur operations are substantially affected by federal, state and local laws and regulations, particularly as they relate to the regulation of crude oil and natural gas production and transportation. These laws and regulations include regulation of crude oil and natural gas E&P and related operations, including a variety of activities related to the drilling of wells, and the interstate transportation of crude oil and natural gas by federal agencies such as FERC, as well as state agencies. We may incur substantial costs in order to maintain compliance with these laws and regulations. Due to recent incidents involving the release of crude oil and natural gas and fluids as a result of drilling activities in the United States, there have been a variety of regulatory initiatives at the federal and state levels to restrict crude oil and natural gas drilling operations in certain locations. Any increased regulation or suspension of crude oil and natural gas exploration and production, or revision or reinterpretation of existing laws and regulations, that arise out of these incidents or otherwise could result in delays and higher operating costs. Such costs or significant delays could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We must also comply with laws and regulations prohibiting fraud and market manipulations in energy markets. To the lesser extent we are a shipper on interstate pipelines, we must comply with the FERC-approved tariffs of such pipelines and with federal policies related to the use of interstate capacity.\nShould we fail to comply with all applicable statutes, rules, regulations and orders of FERC, the CFTC or the FTC, we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines.\nIn addition, federal laws prohibit market manipulation in connection with the purchase or sale of crude oil and/or natural gas. Failure to comply with federal, state and local laws could adversely affect our ability to produce, gather and transport our crude oil and natural gas and may result in substantial penalties. Please see \u201cItem 1. Business-Other federal laws and regulations affecting our industry.\u201d\nOur business involves the selling and shipping by rail of crude oil and NGLs, including from the Bakken shale, which involves risks of derailment, accidents and liabilities associated with cleanup and damages, as well as potential regulatory changes that may adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nA portion of our crude oil and NGL production is transported to market centers by rail. Past derailments in North America of trains transporting crude oil have caused various regulatory agencies and industry organizations, as well as federal, state and municipal governments, to focus attention on transportation by rail of flammable materials. Transportation safety regulators in the United States and Canada are concerned that crude oil from the Bakken shale may be more flammable than crude oil from other producing regions and have made or are considering changes to existing regulations to address those possible risks. In 2015, PHMSA adopted a final rule that includes, among other things, additional requirements to enhance tank car standards for certain trains carrying crude oil and ethanol, a classification and testing program for crude oil, new operational protocols for trains transporting large volumes of flammable liquids, and a requirement that older DOT-111 tank cars be phased out by as early as January 1, 2018 if they are not already retrofitted to comply with new tank car design standards.\nIn 2016, PHMSA released a final rule mandating a phase-out schedule for all DOT-111 tank cars used to transport Class 3 flammable liquids, including crude oil and ethanol, between 2018 and 2029 and more recently in February 2019, PHMSA published a final rule requiring railroads to develop and submit comprehensive crude oil spill response plans for specific route segments traveled by a single train carrying 20 or more loaded tanks of liquid petroleum oil in a continuous block or a single train carrying 35 or more loaded tank cars of liquid petroleum oil throughout the train. Additionally, the February 2019 final rule requires railroads to establish geographic response zones along various rail routes, ensure that both personnel and equipment are staged and prepared to respond in the event of an accident, and share information about high-hazard flammable train operations with state and tribal emergency response commissions. In addition to these or other actions taken or proposed by federal agencies, a number of states proposed or enacted laws in recent years that encourage safer rail operations, urge the federal government to strengthen requirements for these operations or otherwise seek to impose more stringent standards on crude oil being transported by rail. For example, in the absence of a current federal standard on the vapor pressure of crude oil transported by rail, the State of Washington passed a law that became effective on July 28, 2019, prohibiting the loading or unloading of crude oil from a rail car in the state unless the crude oil vapor pressure is lower than nine pounds per square inch. In response, the States of North Dakota and Montana filed a preemption application with PHMSA in July 2019, in which the states seek to have PHMSA make an administrative determination and override the Washington State vapor pressure limits. In July 2019, PHMSA published an invitation for public comments on the preemption application, which comment period closed in the latter half of 2019, with no administrative determination yet being released.\nEfforts are likewise underway in Canada to assess and address risks from the transport of crude oil by rail. For example, in 2014, Transport Canada issued a protective order prohibiting crude oil shippers from using 5,000 of the DOT-111 tank cars and imposing a three year phase out period for approximately 65,000 tank cars that do not meet certain safety requirements. Transport Canada also imposed a 50 mile per hour speed limit on trains carrying hazardous materials and required all crude oil shipments in Canada to have an emergency response plan. At the same time that PHMSA released its 2015 rule, Canada\u2019s Minister of Transport announced Canada\u2019s new tank car standards, which largely align with the requirements in the PHMSA rule. Likewise, Transport Canada\u2019s rail car retrofitting and phase out timeline largely aligns with the timeline introduced under the 2015 and 2016 PHMSA rules. Transport Canada has also introduced new requirements that railways carry minimum levels of insurance depending on the quantity of crude oil or dangerous goods that they transport as well as a final report recommending additional practices for the transportation of dangerous goods. Both Transport Canada and PHMSA issued final rules in 2018 that further harmonize their respective tank car standards, including with respect to tank car approvals and design requirements.\nNew laws and regulations, amendment of existing laws and regulations, reinterpretation of legal requirements or increased governmental enforcement regarding hazardous material transportation may occur in the future, which could directly and indirectly increase our operation, compliance and transportation costs and lead to shortages in availability of tank cars. We cannot assure that costs incurred to comply with standards and regulations emerging from these existing and any future rulemakings will not be material to our business, financial condition or results of operations. Moreover, we may incur significant constraints on transportation capacity during the period while tank cars are being retrofitted or newly constructed to comply with the new regulations. In addition, any derailment of crude oil or NGLs from the Bakken shale involving crude oil or NGLs that we have sold or are shipping may result in claims being brought against us that may involve significant liabilities.\nAlthough we believe that we are adequately insured against such events, we cannot assure you that our insurance policies will cover the entirety of any damages that may arise from such events.\nOur E&P and midstream operations are subject to a number of risks arising out of concerns regarding the threat of climate change that could result in increased operating costs and costs of compliance, limit the areas in which crude oil and natural gas production may occur, and reduce demand for the crude oil and natural gas that we produce or provide midstream services for while the physical effects of climate change could disrupt our production or midstream services and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects.\nThe threat of climate change continues to attract considerable attention in the United States and in foreign countries. Numerous proposals have been made and are likely to continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit emissions of GHGs as well as to restrict or eliminate such future emissions. As a result, our operations as well as the operations of our crude oil and natural gas exploration and production customers are subject to a series of regulatory, political, litigation and financial risks associated with the production and processing of fossil fuels and emission of GHGs.\nIn the United States, no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented at the federal level. However, with the U.S. Supreme Court finding that GHG emissions constitute a pollutant under the CAA, the EPA has adopted rules that, among other things, establish construction and operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources, require the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas system sources, implement NSPS directing the reduction of methane from certain new, modified, or reconstructed facilities in the crude oil and natural gas sector, and together with the United States Department of Transportation, implement GHG emissions limits on vehicles manufactured for operation in the United States. Additionally, various states and groups of states have adopted or are considering adopting legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that are focused on such areas as GHG cap and trade programs, carbon taxes, reporting and tracking programs, and restriction of emissions. At the international level, there exists the United Nations-sponsored \u201cParis Agreement,\u201d which is a non-binding agreement for nations to limit their GHG emissions through individually-determined reduction goals every five years after 2020, although the United States has announced its withdrawal from such agreement, effective November 4, 2020.\nGovernmental, scientific, and public concern over the threat of climate change arising from GHG emissions has resulted in federal political risks in the United States in the form of pledges made by certain candidates seeking the office of the President of the United States in 2020. Critical declarations made by one or more presidential candidates include proposals to ban hydraulic fracturing of crude oil and natural gas wells and ban new leases for production of minerals on federal properties, including onshore lands and offshore waters. Other actions to crude oil and natural gas production activities that could be pursued by presidential candidates may include more restrictive requirements for the establishment of pipeline infrastructure or the permitting of liquefied natural gas export facilities, as well as the rescission of the United States\u2019 withdrawal from the Paris Agreement in November 2020. Litigation risks are also increasing, as a number of cities, local governments and other plaintiffs have sought to bring suit against the largest crude oil and natural gas exploration and production companies in state or federal court, alleging, among other things, that such companies created public nuisances by producing fuels that contributed to global warming effects, such as rising sea levels, and therefore are responsible for roadway and infrastructure damages as a result, or alleging that the companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change for some time but defrauded their investors by failing to adequately disclose those impacts.\nThere are also increasing financial risks for fossil fuel producers as shareholders and bondholders currently invested in fossil-fuel energy companies concerned about the potential effects of climate change may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investments into non-fossil fuel energy related sectors. Institutional lenders who provide financing to fossil-fuel energy companies also have become more attentive to sustainable lending practices and some of them may elect not to provide funding for fossil fuel energy companies. Additionally, the lending practices of institutional lenders have been the subject of intensive lobbying efforts in recent years, oftentimes public in nature, by environmental activists, proponents of the international Paris Agreement, and foreign citizenry concerned about climate change not to provide funding for fossil fuel producers. Limitation of investments in and financings for fossil fuel energy companies could result in the restriction, delay or cancellation of drilling programs or development or production activities.\nThe adoption and implementation of any international, federal or state legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur increased costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements, including the imposition of a carbon tax, which one or more developments could have an adverse effect on our or our customers\u2019 business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, such new legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost to the consumer, and thereby reduce demand for crude oil and natural gas, which could reduce the demand for the crude oil and natural gas we or our customer produce and lower the value of our reserves as well as reduce demand for our midstream and well services. Additionally, political, financial and litigation risks may result in us and our customers restricting or canceling production activities, incurring liability for infrastructure damages as\na result of climatic changes, or impairing the ability to continue to operate in an economic manner, which also could reduce demand for our midstream services. One or more of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nFinally, it should be noted that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events. If such effects were to occur, our development and production operations have the potential to be adversely affected. Potential adverse effects could include damages to our facilities from powerful winds or rising waters in low lying areas, disruption of our production activities because of climate related damages to our facilities, our costs of operations potentially arising from such climatic effects, less efficient or non-routine operating practices necessitated by such climate effects, or increased costs for insurance coverage in the aftermath of such effects. At this time, we have not developed a comprehensive plan to address the legal, economic, social or physical impacts of climate change on our operations.\nFederal or state legislative and regulatory initiatives related to induced seismicity could result in operating restrictions or delays that could adversely affect the drilling program\u2019s production of crude oil and natural gas.\nOperations associated with our production and development activities generate drilling muds, produced waters and other waste streams, some of which may be disposed of by means of injection into underground wells situated in non-producing subsurface formations. These injection wells are regulated pursuant to the UIC program established under the SDWA. In response to recent seismic events near underground injection wells used for the disposal of produced water from crude oil and natural gas activities, federal and some state agencies are investigating whether such wells have caused increased seismic activity, and some states have restricted, suspended or shut down the use of such injection wells. In 2016, the United States Geological Survey identified Texas as being among six states with areas of increased rates of induced seismicity that could be attributed to fluid injection or crude oil and natural gas extraction. Since that time, the United States Geological Survey indicates that these rates have decreased in these six states, although concern continues to exist over quakes arising from induced seismic activities. In response to concerns regarding induced seismicity, regulators in some states have imposed, or are considering imposing, additional requirements in the permitting of produced water disposal wells or otherwise to assess any relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells. For example, in Texas, the RRC has adopted rules governing the permitting or re-permitting of wells used to dispose of produced water and other fluids resulting from the production of crude oil and natural gas in order to address these seismic activity concerns within the state. Among other things, these rules require companies seeking permits for disposal wells to provide seismic activity data in permit applications, provide for more frequent monitoring and reporting for certain wells and allow the state to modify, suspend or terminate permits on grounds that a disposal well is likely to be, or determined to be, causing seismic activity. Another consequence of seismic events may be lawsuits alleging that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal. These developments could result in additional regulation and restrictions on the use of injection wells by us or our customers. If new regulatory initiatives are implemented that restrict or prohibit the use of underground injection wells in areas where we rely upon the use of such wells in operational activities, our or our customers\u2019 costs to operate may significantly increase and our ability to continue production or conduct midstream services or dispose of produced water may be delayed or limited, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFederal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing as well as governmental reviews of such activities could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays in the completion of crude oil and natural gas wells and adversely affect our production.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or crude oil from dense subsurface rock formations. The process involves the injection of water, sand or other proppant and chemical additives under pressure into the targeted subsurface formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. We routinely use hydraulic fracturing techniques in many of our drilling and completion programs.\nThe process is typically regulated by state crude oil and natural gas commissions or similar agencies, but federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority or conducted investigations over certain aspects of the process. For example, the EPA has asserted regulatory authority under the SDWA over hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel and issued guidance covering such activities, as well as published an ANPR regarding Toxic Substances Control Act reporting of the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing; issued final CAA regulations that include NSPS for completions of hydraulically fractured natural gas wells and new emissions standards for methane from certain new, modified and reconstructed equipment and processes in the crude oil and natural gas source category; and published an effluent limit guideline final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional crude oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. The BLM published a final rule in 2015 that established new or more stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands but the BLM rescinded the 2015 rule in late 2017; however, litigation challenging the BLM\u2019s decision to rescind the 2015 rule is pending in federal district court. Also, in late 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources,\nconcluding that \u201cwater cycle\u201d activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under some circumstances.\nIn addition, from time to time Congress has considered, but not adopted, legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. However, the threat of climate change has resulted in increasing political risks in the United States, including climate-related pledges to ban hydraulic fracturing of oil and gas wells being made by certain candidates seeking the office of President of the United States in 2020.\nAt the state level, some states, including North Dakota and Texas where we primarily operate, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. States could elect to adopt certain prohibitions on hydraulic fracturing altogether, following the approach taken by the States of Maryland, New York and Vermont. Local government also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. Increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition to, and litigation concerning, crude oil and natural gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. Any, new or more stringent legal restrictions or bans relating to hydraulic fracturing adopted in areas where we operate, or in the future plan to operate, could also lead to delays in, or restriction or cancellation of, our or our customers\u2019 operations, result in increased operating costs in our or our customers\u2019 production of crude oil and natural gas, potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new crude oil and natural gas wells and perhaps even be limited or precluded from drilling wells or in the volume that we are ultimately able to produce from our reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations with respect to E&P activities and midstream and well services. We may not be insured for, or our insurance may be inadequate to protect us against, these risks.\nOperations using hydraulic fracturing are substantially dependent on the availability of water. Restrictions on the ability to obtain water for E&P activities and the disposal of flowback and produced water may impact operations and have a corresponding adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nWater is an essential component of shale oil and natural gas production during both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. Our access to water to be used in these processes may be adversely affected due to reasons such as periods of extended drought, private, third party competition for water in localized areas or the implementation of local or state governmental programs to monitor or restrict the beneficial use of water subject to their jurisdiction for hydraulic fracturing to assure adequate local water supplies. The occurrence of these or similar developments may result in limitations being placed on allocations of water due to needs by third party businesses with more senior contractual or permitting rights to the water. Our inability to locate or contractually acquire and sustain the receipt of sufficient amounts of water could adversely impact our E&P operations or midstream and well services and have a corresponding adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMoreover, the imposition of new environmental regulations and other regulatory initiatives could include increased restrictions on our or our customers\u2019 ability to dispose of flowback and produced water generated in hydraulic fracturing or other fluids resulting from E&P activities. Applicable laws, including the Clean Water Act, impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into waters of the United States and require that permits or other approvals be obtained to discharge pollutants to such waters. For example, in 2015, the EPA and the Corps under the Obama Administration issued a final rule outlining their position on the federal jurisdictional reach over waters of the United States. In 2017, the EPA and the Corps under the Trump Administration agreed to reconsider the 2015 rule and, thereafter, in October 2019, the agencies published a final rule made effective on December 23, 2019, rescinding the 2015 rule. On January 23, 2020, the two agencies issued a final rule re-defining the Clean Water Act\u2019s jurisdiction over waters of the United States, which redefinition is narrower than found in the 2015 rule. Upon being published in the Federal Register and the passage of 60 days thereafter, the January 23, 2020 final rule will become effective, at which point the United States will be covered under a single regulatory scheme as it relates to federal jurisdictional reach over waters of the United States. However, there remains the expectation that the January 23, 2020 final rule also will be legally challenged in federal district court. Additionally, regulations implemented under the Clean Water Act and similar state laws prohibit the discharge of produced water and sand, drilling fluids, drill cuttings and certain other substances related to the crude oil and natural gas industry into coastal waters. The Clean Water Act and analogous state laws provide for civil, criminal and administrative penalties for any unauthorized discharges of pollutants and unauthorized discharges of reportable quantities of crude oil and hazardous substances. Compliance with current and future environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal, storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells and any inability to secure transportation and access to disposal wells with sufficient capacity to accept all of our or our customers\u2019 flowback and produced water on economic terms may increase our or our customers\u2019 operating costs and cause delays, interruptions or termination of our or our customers\u2019 operations, the extent of which cannot be predicted but that could be materially adverse to our business and results of operations.\nFederal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to pipeline safety that require the use of new or more stringent safety controls, substantial changes to existing integrity management programs or more stringent enforcement of applicable legal requirements could subject us to increased capital and operating costs and operational delays.\nCertain of our pipelines are subject to regulation by PHMSA under the HLPSA with respect to crude oil and condensate and the NGPSA with respect to natural gas. The HLPSA and NGPSA govern the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of hazardous liquid and gas pipeline facilities. These laws have resulted in the adoption of rules by PHMSA, that, among other things, require transportation pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs, including more frequent inspections, correction of identified anomalies and other measures to ensure pipeline safety in HCAs, such as high population areas, areas unusually sensitive to environmental damage and commercially navigable waterways. In addition, states have adopted regulations similar to existing PHMSA regulations for certain intrastate gas and hazardous liquid pipelines, which regulations may impose more stringent requirements than found under federal law. Historically, our pipeline safety compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance costs will not have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. New pipeline safety laws or regulations, amendment of existing laws and regulations, reinterpretation of legal requirements or increases in governmental enforcement adopted by PHMSA may impose more stringent requirements applicable to integrity management programs and other pipeline safety aspects of our operations, which could cause us to incur increased capital and operating costs and operational delays.\nLegislation in recent years has resulted in more stringent mandates for pipeline safety and has charged PHMSA with developing and adopting regulations that impose increased pipeline safety requirements on pipeline operators. The HLPSA and NGPSA were amended by the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act, which among other things, increased the penalties for safety violations, established additional safety requirements for newly constructed pipelines and required studies of safety issues that could result in the adoption of new regulatory requirements by PHMSA for existing pipelines. In 2016, the 2016 Pipeline Safety Act was passed, extending PHMSA\u2019s statutory mandate through September 2019 and, among other things, requiring PHMSA to complete certain of its outstanding mandates under the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act and developing new safety standards for gas storage facilities. The 2016 Act also empowers PHMSA to address unsafe conditions or practices constituting imminent hazards by imposing emergency restrictions, prohibitions and safety measures on owners and operators of hazardous liquid or gas pipeline facilities without prior notice or an opportunity for a hearing. PHMSA issued an interim rule in 2016 and published a final rule on October 1, 2019 to implement the agency\u2019s expanded authority to address such conditions or practices that pose an imminent hazard to life, property or the environment. Because the 2016 Pipeline Safety Act reauthorized PHMSA\u2019s hazardous liquid and gas pipeline programs only through September 30, 2019, we anticipate that Congress will issue an updated pipeline safety law in 2020 that will reauthorize those programs through 2023.\nThe adoption of new or amended regulations by PHMSA that result in more stringent or costly pipeline integrity management or safety standards could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations. For example, on October 1, 2019, PHMSA published a final rule for hazardous liquid transmission and gathering pipelines that becomes effective July 1, 2020 and significantly extends and expands the reach of certain PHMSA hazardous liquid pipeline integrity management requirements regardless of the pipeline\u2019s proximity to a HCA (for example, integrity assessments at least once every 10 years of onshore, piggable, hazardous liquid pipeline segments located outside of HCAs, and expanded use of leak detection systems beyond HCAs to all regulated hazardous liquid pipelines other than offshore gathering and regulated rural gathering pipelines). The final rule also requires all hazardous liquid pipelines in or affecting a HCA to be capable of accommodating in line inspection tools within the next 20 years unless the basic construction of a pipeline cannot be modified to permit that accommodation. Also, this final rule extends annual, accident, and safety-related conditional reporting requirements to hazardous liquid gravity lines and certain gathering lines and also imposes inspection requirements on hazardous liquid pipelines in areas affected by extreme weather events and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, landslides, floods, earthquakes or other similar events that are likely to damage infrastructure. In a second example, in 2016, PHMSA announced a proposed rulemaking that would impose new or more stringent requirements for certain gas lines and gathering lines including, among other things, expanding certain of PHMSA\u2019s current regulatory safety programs for gas pipelines in newly defined MCAs that contain as few as five dwellings within a potential impact area; requiring natural gas pipelines installed before 1970 and thus excluded from certain pressure testing obligations to be tested to determine their MAOP; and requiring certain onshore and offshore gathering lines in Class I areas to comply with damage prevention, corrosion control, public education, MAOP limits, line markers and emergency planning standards. Additional requirements proposed by this proposed rulemaking would increase PHMSA\u2019s integrity management requirements for gas pipelines and also require consideration of seismicity in evaluating threats to pipelines. PHMSA has since decided to split its 2016 proposed rule, which has become known as the \u201cgas mega rule,\u201d into three separate rulemaking proceedings to facilitate completion. The first of these three rulemakings, relating to onshore gas transmission pipelines, was published as a final rule on October 1, 2019, becomes effective on July 1, 2020, and imposes numerous requirements on such pipelines, including MAOP reconfirmation, the assessment of additional pipeline mileage outside of HCAs (including all MCAs and those Class 3 and Class 4 areas found not to be in HCAs) within 14 years of publication date and at least once every 10 years thereafter, the reporting of exceedances of MAOP, and the consideration of\nseismicity as a risk factor in integrity management. The remaining rulemakings comprising the gas mega rule are expected to be issued in 2020. New legislation or any new regulations adopted by PHMSA may impose more stringent requirements applicable to integrity management programs and other pipeline safety aspects of our operations, which could cause us to incur increased capital and operating costs and operational delays. In the absence of the PHMSA pursuing any legal requirements, state agencies, to the extent authorized, may pursue state standards, including standards for rural gathering lines.\nWe do not own all of the land on which our pipelines and associated facilities are located, which could result in disruptions to our operations.\nWe do not own all of the land on which our pipelines and associated facilities have been constructed, and we are, therefore, subject to the possibility of more onerous terms and/or increased costs to retain necessary land use if we do not have valid rights-of-way or if such rights-of-way lapse or terminate. We obtain the rights to construct and operate our pipelines on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time. Additionally, the federal Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, has held that tribal ownership of even a very small fractional interest in an allotted land, that is, tribal land owned or at one time owned by an individual Indian landowner, bars condemnation of any interest in the allotment. Consequently, the inability to condemn such allotted lands under circumstances where an existing pipeline rights-of-way may soon lapse or terminate serves as an additional impediment for pipeline operators. We cannot guarantee that we will always be able to renew existing rights-of-way or obtain new rights-of-way without experiencing significant costs. Any loss of rights with respect to our real property, through our inability to renew right-of-way contracts or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and ability to make cash distributions to the unitholders of OMP.\nCompetition in the crude oil and natural gas industry is intense, making it more difficult for us to acquire properties, market crude oil and natural gas and secure trained personnel.\nOur ability to acquire additional drilling locations and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties, market crude oil and natural gas and secure equipment and trained personnel. Also, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the crude oil and natural gas industry. Many of our competitors possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours. Those companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and gas properties and exploratory drilling locations or to identify, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and locations than our financial or personnel resources permit. Furthermore, these companies may also be better able to withstand the financial pressures of unsuccessful drilling attempts, sustained periods of volatility in financial markets and generally adverse global and industry-wide economic conditions, and may be better able to absorb the burdens resulting from changes in relevant laws and regulations, which would adversely affect our competitive position. In addition, companies may be able to offer better compensation packages to attract and retain qualified personnel than we are able to offer. The cost to attract and retain qualified personnel has increased over the past few years due to competition and may increase substantially in the future. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future in acquiring prospective reserves, developing reserves, marketing hydrocarbons, attracting and retaining qualified personnel and raising additional capital, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe loss of senior management or technical personnel could adversely affect our operations.\nTo a large extent, we depend on the services of our senior management and technical personnel. The loss of the services of our senior management or technical personnel, including Thomas B. Nusz, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Taylor L. Reid, our President and Chief Operating Officer, could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We do not maintain, nor do we plan to obtain, any insurance against the loss of any of these individuals.\nSeasonal weather conditions adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate.\nCrude oil and natural gas operations in the Williston Basin and the Delaware Basin are adversely affected by seasonal weather conditions. In the Williston Basin, drilling and other crude oil and natural gas activities cannot be conducted as effectively during the winter months. Severe winter weather conditions limit and may temporarily halt our ability to operate during such conditions. Results of operations in the Delaware Basin may also be negatively affected by inclement weather during the winter months to a lesser extent. These constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay or temporarily halt our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs.\nThe inability of one or more of our customers or affiliates to meet their obligations to us may adversely affect our financial results.\nOur principal exposures to credit risk are through receivables resulting from the sale of our crude oil and natural gas production ($276.6 million in receivables at December 31, 2019), which we market to energy marketing companies, other producers,\npower generators, local distribution companies, refineries and affiliates and joint interest receivables ($82.1 million at December 31, 2019).\nWe are subject to credit risk due to the concentration of our crude oil and natural gas receivables with several significant customers. This concentration of customers may impact our overall credit risk since these entities may be similarly affected by changes in economic and other conditions. For the year ended December 31, 2019, sales to Phillips 66 Company accounted for approximately 14% of our total sales from the exploration and production segment. For the year ended 2018, no purchaser accounted for more than 10% of the Company\u2019s total sales from the exploration and production segment. For the year ended December 31, 2017, sales to Shell Trading (US) Company accounted for approximately 16% of our total sales from the exploration and production segment. No other purchasers accounted for more than 10% of our total sales from the exploration and production segment for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2017. We do not require all of our customers to post collateral. The inability or failure of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our financial results.\nJoint interest receivables arise from billing entities who own a partial interest in the wells we operate. These entities participate in our wells primarily based on their ownership in leases on which we choose to drill. We have limited ability to control participation in our wells. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded $0.2 million in bad debt expense as a result of our assessment that it is probable certain receivables may not be collected.\nIn addition, our crude oil and natural gas derivative arrangements expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties. Derivative assets and liabilities arising from derivative contracts with the same counterparty are reported on a net basis, as all counterparty contracts provide for net settlement. At December 31, 2019, we had derivatives in place with nine counterparties and a total net derivative liability of $18.6 million.\nWe may be subject to risks in connection with acquisitions because of uncertainties in evaluating recoverable reserves, well performance and potential liabilities, as well as uncertainties in forecasting crude oil and natural gas prices and future development, production and marketing costs, and the integration of significant acquisitions may be difficult.\nWe periodically evaluate acquisitions of reserves, properties, prospects and leaseholds and other strategic transactions that appear to fit within our overall business strategic tactics. The successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors, including:\n\u2022recoverable reserves;\n\u2022future crude oil and natural gas prices and their appropriate differentials;\n\u2022development and operating costs;\n\u2022potential for future drilling and production;\n\u2022validity of the seller\u2019s title to the properties, which may be less than expected at the time of signing the purchase agreement; and\n\u2022potential environmental and other liabilities, together with associated litigation of such matters.\nThe accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain. In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and potential recoverable reserves. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems. We often are not entitled to contractual indemnification for environmental liabilities or title defects in excess of the amounts claimed by us before closing and acquire properties on an \u201cas is\u201d basis. Indemnification from the sellers will generally be effective only during a limited time period after the closing and subject to certain dollar limitations and minimums. We may not be able to collect on such indemnification because of disputes with the sellers or their inability to pay. Moreover, there is a risk that we could ultimately be liable for unknown obligations related to acquisitions, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nSignificant acquisitions and other strategic transactions may involve other risks, including:\n\u2022diversion of our management\u2019s attention to evaluating, negotiating and integrating significant acquisitions and strategic transactions;\n\u2022the challenge and cost of integrating acquired operations, information management and other technology systems and business cultures with those of our operations while carrying on our ongoing business;\n\u2022difficulty associated with coordinating geographically separate organizations;\n\u2022an inability to secure, on acceptable terms, sufficient financing that may be required in connection with expanded operations and unknown liabilities; and\n\u2022the challenge of attracting and retaining personnel associated with acquired operations.\nThe process of integrating assets could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of our business. Members of our senior management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process, which will decrease the time they will have to manage our business. If our senior management is not able to effectively manage the integration process, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, our business could suffer. The success of an acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize anticipated opportunities from combining the acquired assets or operations with those of ours. Even if we successfully integrate the assets acquired, it may not be possible to realize the full benefits we may expect in estimated proved reserves, production volume, cost savings from operating synergies or other benefits anticipated from an acquisition or realize these benefits within the expected time frame. Anticipated benefits of an acquisition may be offset by operating losses relating to changes in commodity prices, in crude oil and natural gas industry conditions, by risks and uncertainties relating to the exploratory prospects of the combined assets or operations, failure to retain key personnel, an increase in operating or other costs or other difficulties. If we fail to realize the benefits we anticipate from an acquisition, our results of operations and stock price may be adversely affected.\nWe may incur losses as a result of title defects in the properties in which we invest.\nIt is our practice in acquiring crude oil and natural gas leases or interests not to incur the expense of retaining lawyers to examine the title to the mineral interest. Rather, we rely upon the judgment of crude oil and natural gas lease brokers or landmen who perform the fieldwork in examining records in the appropriate governmental office before attempting to acquire a lease in a specific mineral interest.\nPrior to the drilling of a crude oil or natural gas well, however, it is the normal practice in our industry for the person or company acting as the operator of the well to obtain a preliminary title review to ensure there are no obvious defects in the title to the well. Frequently, as a result of such examinations, certain curative work must be done to correct defects in the marketability of the title, and such curative work entails expense. Our failure to cure any title defects may adversely impact our ability in the future to increase production and reserves. There is no assurance that we will not suffer a monetary loss from title defects or title failure. Additionally, undeveloped acreage has greater risk of title defects than developed acreage. If there are any title defects or defects in assignment of leasehold rights in properties in which we hold an interest, we will suffer a financial loss.\nThe enactment of derivatives legislation and regulation could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the negative effect of commodity price changes, interest rate and other risks associated with our business.\nOn July 21, 2010, new comprehensive financial reform legislation, known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), was enacted that establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities, such as us, that participate in that market. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the CFTC, the SEC and other regulators to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the new legislation. In its rulemaking under the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC has proposed new regulations to set position limits for certain futures, options and swap contracts in designated physical commodities, including, among others, crude oil and natural gas. The Dodd-Frank Act and CFTC rules have also designated certain types of swaps (thus far, only certain interest rate swaps and credit default swaps) for mandatory clearing and exchange trading, and may designate other types of swaps for mandatory clearing and exchange trading in the future. To the extent that we engage in such transactions or transactions that become subject to such rules in the future, we will be required to comply with the clearing and exchange trading requirements or to take steps to qualify for an exemption to such requirements. In addition, certain banking regulators and the CFTC have adopted final rules establishing minimum margin requirements for uncleared swaps. Although we expect to qualify for the non-financial end-user exception from margin requirements for swaps to other market participants, such as swap dealers, these rules may change the cost and availability of the swaps we use for hedging. If any of our swaps do not qualify for the non-financial end-user exception, we could be required to post initial or variation margin, which would impact liquidity and reduce our cash. This would in turn reduce our ability to execute hedges to reduce risk and protect cash flows. Other regulations to be promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Act also remain to be finalized. As a result, it is not possible at this time to predict with certainty the full effects of the Dodd-Frank Act and CFTC rules on us and the timing of such effects. The Dodd-Frank Act and regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts, materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts, and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. Further, to the extent our revenues are unhedged, they could be adversely affected if a consequence of the Dodd-Frank Act and implementing regulations is to lower commodity prices. Any of these\nconsequences could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, the European Union and other non-U.S. jurisdictions are implementing regulations with respect to the derivatives market. To the extent we transact with counterparties in foreign jurisdictions, we may become subject to such regulations.\nWe may not be able to utilize a portion of our net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal or state tax purposes, which could adversely affect our net income and cash flows.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had significant federal and state income tax NOLs, which will begin to expire in 2030 and 2020 for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes, respectively. Utilization of these NOLs depends on many factors, including our future taxable income, which cannot be assured. In addition, Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (\u201cSection 382\u201d), generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of an NOL that may be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone an \u201cownership change.\u201d Determining the limitations under Section 382 is technical and highly complex. We may in the future undergo an ownership change under Section 382. If an ownership change occurs in the future, we may be prevented from fully utilizing our NOLs, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nAn unfavorable resolution of the Mirada Litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOn March 23, 2017, Mirada (as defined in \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d) filed a lawsuit against Oasis Petroleum Inc., OPNA and OMS in the 334th Judicial District Court of Harris County, Texas. Mirada asserts that it is a working interest owner in certain acreage owned and operated by us and that we have breached certain agreements by: (1) failing to allow Mirada to participate in the Company\u2019s midstream operations in Wild Basin; (2) refusing to provide Mirada with information that Mirada contends is required under certain agreements and failing to provide information in a timely fashion; (3) failing to consult with Mirada and failing to obtain Mirada\u2019s consent prior to drilling more than one well at a time in Wild Basin; and (4) overstating the estimated costs of proposed well operations in Wild Basin. Mirada seeks a declaratory judgment that the Company be removed as operator in Wild Basin at Mirada\u2019s election and that Mirada be allowed to elect a new operator; certain agreements apply to the Company and Mirada and Wild Basin with respect to this dispute; the Company be required to provide all information within its possession regarding proposed or ongoing operations in Wild Basin; and the Company not be permitted to drill, or propose to drill, more than one well at a time in Wild Basin without obtaining Mirada\u2019s consent. Mirada also seeks a declaratory judgment with respect to the Company\u2019s current midstream operations in Wild Basin. Specifically, Mirada seeks a declaratory judgment that Mirada has a right to participate in the Company\u2019s Wild Basin midstream operations, consisting of produced water disposal, crude oil gathering and natural gas gathering and processing; that, upon Mirada\u2019s election to participate, Mirada is obligated to pay its proportionate costs of the Company\u2019s midstream operations in Wild Basin; and that Mirada would then be entitled to receive a share of revenues from the midstream operations and would not be charged any amount for its use of these facilities for production from the \u201cContract Area.\u201d\nOn June 30, 2017, Mirada amended its original petition to add a claim that we have breached certain agreements by charging Mirada for midstream services provided by its affiliates and to seek a declaratory judgment that Mirada is entitled to be paid its share of total proceeds from the sale of hydrocarbons received by OPNA or any affiliate of OPNA without deductions for midstream services provided by OPNA or its affiliates.\nOn February 2, 2018 and February 16, 2018, Mirada filed a second and third amended petition, respectively. In these filings, Mirada alleged new legal theories for being entitled to enforce the underlying contracts and added Bighorn DevCo, Bobcat DevCo and Beartooth DevCo as defendants, asserting that these entities were created in bad faith in an effort to avoid contractual obligations owed to Mirada.\nOn March 2, 2018, Mirada filed a fourth amended petition that described Mirada\u2019s alleged ownership and assignment of interests in assets purportedly governed by agreements at issue in the lawsuit. On August 31, 2018, Mirada filed a fifth amended petition that added OMP as a defendant, asserting that it was created in bad faith in an effort to avoid contractual obligations owed to Mirada.\nOn July 2, 2019, Oasis, OPNA, OMS, OMP, Bighorn DevCo, Bobcat DevCo and Beartooth DevCo (collectively \u201cOasis Entities\u201d) counterclaimed against Mirada for a judgment declaring that Oasis Entities are not obligated to purchase, manage, gather, transport, compress, process, market, sell or otherwise handle Mirada\u2019s proportionate share of crude oil and gas produced from OPNA-operated wells. The counterclaim also seeks attorney\u2019s fees, costs and expenses.\nOn November 1, 2019, Mirada filed a sixth amended petition that stated that Mirada seeks in excess of $200 million in damages and asserted that OMS is an agent of OPNA and that OPNA, OMS, OMP, Bighorn DevCo, Bobcat DevCo and Beartooth DevCo are agents of Oasis. Mirada also changed its allegation that it may elect a new operator for the subject wells to instead allege that Mirada may remove OPNA as operator.\nOn November 1, 2019, the Oasis Entities amended their counterclaim against Mirada to include a request for a judgment declaring that a provision in one of the agreements does not incorporate by reference any provisions in a certain participation\nagreement and joint operating agreement. The additional counterclaim also seeks attorney\u2019s fees, costs and expenses. On the same day, the Oasis Entities filed an amended answer asserting additional defenses against Mirada\u2019s claims. Mirada may further amend its petition from time to time to assert additional claims as well as defendants.\nDiscovery is ongoing, and each of the parties has made a number of procedural filings and motions, and additional filings and motions can be expected over the course of the claim. Trial is scheduled for May 2020. For further information regarding this lawsuit, please read \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings.\u201d We cannot predict the outcome of the Mirada Litigation or the amount of time and expense that will be required to resolve the lawsuit. If such litigation were to be determined adversely to our interests, or if we were forced to settle such matter for a significant amount, such resolution or settlement could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Such an adverse determination could materially impact our ability to operate our properties in Wild Basin or develop our identified drilling locations in Wild Basin on our current development schedule. A determination that Mirada has a right to participate in our midstream operations could materially reduce the interests of us in our current assets and future midstream opportunities and related revenues in Wild Basin. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify OMP for any losses resulting from this litigation under the omnibus agreement we entered into with OMP at the time of its initial public offering.\nWe are from time to time involved in legal, governmental and regulatory proceedings that could result in substantial liabilities.\nLike other similarly-situated oil and gas companies, we are from time to time involved in various legal, governmental and regulatory proceedings in the ordinary course of business including, but not limited to, commercial disputes, claims from royalty and surface owners, property damage claims, personal injury claims, regulatory compliance matters, disputes with tax authorities and other matters. The outcome of such matters often cannot be predicted with certainty. If our efforts to defend ourselves in legal, governmental and regulatory matters are not successful, it is possible the outcome of one or more such proceedings could result in substantial liability, penalties, sanctions, judgments, consent decrees or orders requiring a change in our business practices, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Judgments and estimates to determine accruals related to legal, governmental and regulatory proceedings could change from period to period, and such changes could be material.\nDisputes or uncertainties may arise in relation to our royalty obligations.\nOur production is subject to royalty obligations which may be prescribed by government regulation or by contract. These royalty obligations may be subject to changes in interpretation as business circumstances change and the law in jurisdictions in which we operate continues to evolve. For example, the Supreme Court of North Dakota recently issued an opinion indicating a change in its interpretation of how certain gas royalty payments are calculated under North Dakota law with respect to certain state leases, the impacts of which are still unclear. Such changes in interpretation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, such changes in interpretation could result in legal or other proceedings. Please see \u201cWe are from time to time involved in legal, governmental and regulatory proceedings that could result in substantial liabilities\u201d for a discussion of risks related to such proceedings.\nTerrorist attacks or cyber-attacks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nTerrorist attacks or cyber-attacks may significantly affect the energy industry, including our operations and those of our potential customers, as well as general economic conditions, consumer confidence and spending and market liquidity. Strategic targets, such as energy-related assets, may be at greater risk of future attacks than other targets in the United States. Also, destructive forms of protests and opposition by extremists and other disruptions, including acts of sabotage or eco-terrorism, against crude oil and natural gas development and production or midstream processing or transportation activities could potentially result in damage or injury to persons, property or the environment or lead to extended interruptions of our operations. Our insurance may not protect us against such occurrences. Consequently, it is possible that any of these occurrences, or a combination of them, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA cyber incident could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.\nThe crude oil and natural gas industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations, including certain midstream activities. For example, software programs are used to manage gathering and transportation systems and for compliance reporting. The use of mobile communication devices has increased rapidly. Industrial control systems such as SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) now control large scale processes that can include multiple sites and long distances, such as crude oil and natural gas pipelines. We depend on digital technology, including information systems and related infrastructure as well as cloud applications and services, to process and record financial and operating data and to communicate with our employees and business partners. Our business partners, including\nvendors, service providers and financial institutions, are also dependent on digital technology. The technologies needed to conduct midstream activities make certain information the target of theft or misappropriation.\nAs dependence on digital technologies has increased, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks or unintentional events, also has increased. A cyber attack could include gaining unauthorized access to digital systems or data for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data or causing operational disruption. SCADA-based systems are potentially vulnerable to targeted cyber attacks due to their critical role in operations.\nOur technologies, systems, networks and data, and those of our business partners, may become the target of cyber attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information or other disruption of our business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as unauthorized surveillance or a cyber breach, may remain undetected for an extended period.\nA cyber incident involving our information systems or data and related infrastructure, or that of our business partners, including any vendor or service provider, could disrupt our business plans and negatively impact our operations in the following ways, among others:\n\u2022supply chain disruptions, which could delay or halt development of additional infrastructure, effectively delaying the start of cash flows from the project;\n\u2022delays in delivering or failure to deliver product at the tailgate of our facilities, resulting in a loss of revenues;\n\u2022operational disruption resulting in loss of revenues;\n\u2022events of non-compliance that could lead to regulatory fines or penalties; and\n\u2022business interruptions that could result in expensive remediation efforts, distraction of management, damage to our reputation or a negative impact on the price of our units.\nOur implementation of various controls and processes, including globally incorporating a risk-based cyber security framework, to monitor and mitigate security threats and to increase security for our information, facilities and infrastructure is costly and labor intensive. Moreover, there can be no assurance that such measures will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nIneffective internal controls could impact our business and financial results.\nOur internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business and financial results could be harmed and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations.\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock\nWe do not intend to pay, and we are currently prohibited from paying, dividends on our common stock and, consequently, our shareholders\u2019 only opportunity to achieve a return on their investment is if the price of our stock appreciates.\nWe do not plan to declare dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Additionally, we are currently restricted from making any cash dividends pursuant to the terms of our Revolving Credit Facilities and the indentures governing our Senior Notes. Consequently, our shareholders\u2019 only opportunity to achieve a return on their investment in us will be if the market price of our common stock appreciates, which may not occur, and the shareholder sells their shares at a profit. There is no guarantee that the price of our common stock will ever exceed the price that the shareholder paid.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, and amended and restated bylaws, as well as Delaware law, contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, authorizes our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. If our Board of Directors elects to issue preferred stock, it could be more difficult for a third party to acquire us. In addition, some provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, and amended and restated bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders, including:\n\u2022a classified Board of Directors, so that only approximately one-third of our directors are elected each year;\n\u2022limitations on the removal of directors; and\n\u2022limitations on the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings and establish advance notice provisions for stockholder proposals and nominations for elections to the Board of Directors to be acted upon at meetings of stockholders.\nDelaware law prohibits us from engaging in any business combination with any \u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d meaning generally that a stockholder who beneficially owns more than 15% of our stock cannot acquire us for a period of three years from the date this person became an interested stockholder, unless various conditions are met, such as approval of the transaction by our Board of Directors.\nConversion of the Senior Convertible Notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders, or may otherwise depress the market price of our common stock.\nThe conversion of some or all of the Senior Convertible Notes (as defined in \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d) may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders of our common stock. Any sales in the public market of the shares of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the Senior Convertible Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Senior Convertible Notes could be used to satisfy short positions, and anticipated conversion of the Senior Convertible Notes into shares of our common stock could depress the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 93420, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "OAS"}
