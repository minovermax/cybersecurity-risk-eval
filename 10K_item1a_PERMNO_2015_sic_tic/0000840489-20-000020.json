{"cik": "840489", "company": "FIRSTCASH, INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-03", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nImportant risk factors that could materially affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods are described below. These factors are not intended to be an all-encompassing list of risks and uncertainties and are not the only risks and uncertainties facing the Company. Additional risks not currently known to the Company or that it currently deems to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect its business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods.\nOperational, Strategic and General Business Risks\nIncreased competition from banks, credit unions, internet-based lenders, other short-term consumer lenders, governmental entities and other organizations offering similar financial services and retail products offered by the Company, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s principal competitors are other pawnshops, consumer loan companies, internet-based lenders, consumer finance companies, rent-to-own stores, retail finance programs, payroll lenders, banks, credit unions and other financial institutions that serve the Company\u2019s primarily cost conscious and underbanked customer base. Many other financial institutions, governmental entities or other businesses that do not now offer products or services directed toward the Company\u2019s traditional customer base, many of whom may be much larger than the Company, could begin doing so. Significant increases in the number and size of competitors for the Company\u2019s business could result in a decrease in the number of consumer loans or pawn transactions that the Company writes, resulting in lower levels of revenue and earnings in these categories. Furthermore, the Company has many competitors to its retail operations, such as retailers of new merchandise, retailers of pre-owned merchandise, other pawnshops, thrift shops, online retailers, online classified advertising sites and online auction sites and many consumers view these competitors as a more secure option to acquiring similar products to what the Company sells.\nIn Mexico, the Company competes directly with government sponsored or affiliated non-profit foundations operating pawn stores. The Mexican government could take regulatory or administrative actions that would harm the Company\u2019s ability to compete profitably in the Mexico market. Increased competition or aggressive marketing and pricing practices by these competitors could result in decreased revenue, margins and inventory turnover rates in the Company\u2019s retail operations.\nA decrease in demand for the Company\u2019s products and services and the failure of the Company to adapt to such decreases could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nAlthough the Company actively manages its products and service offerings to ensure that such offerings meet the needs and preferences of its customer base, the demand for a particular product or service may decrease due to a variety of factors, including many that the Company may not be able to control, anticipate or respond to in a timely manner, such as the availability and pricing of competing products or technology, changes in customers\u2019 financial conditions as a result of changes in unemployment levels, fuel prices, interest rates, government sponsored social welfare or benefit programs, other economic conditions or other events, real or perceived loss of consumer confidence or regulatory restrictions that increase or reduce customer access to particular products. Should the Company fail to adapt to a significant change in its customers\u2019 demand for, or regular access to, its products, the Company\u2019s revenue could decrease significantly. Even if the Company makes adaptations, its customers may resist or may reject products or services whose adaptations make them less attractive or less available. In any event, the effect of any product or service change on the results of the Company\u2019s business may not be fully ascertainable until the change has been in effect for some time. In particular, the Company has changed, and will continue to change, some of the consumer loan products and services it offers due to regulatory developments. Demand may also fluctuate by geographic region. The current geographic concentration of the Company\u2019s stores creates exposure to local economies and politics, and regional downturns (see \u201cItem 1. Business-Locations and Operations\u201d for store concentration by state). As a result, the Company\u2019s business is currently more susceptible to regional conditions than the operations of more geographically diversified competitors, and the Company is vulnerable to economic downturns or changing political landscapes in those regions. Any unforeseen events or circumstances that negatively affect these areas could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues and profitability.\nThe Company depends on its senior management and may not be able to retain those employees or recruit additional qualified personnel.\nThe Company depends on its senior management to execute its business strategy and oversee its operations. A significant increase in the costs to retain any members of the Company\u2019s senior management could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and operations. Furthermore, the loss of services of any of the members of the Company\u2019s senior management could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business until a suitable replacement can be found. There may be a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions, and the Company cannot ensure that it would be able to identify or employ such qualified personnel on acceptable terms.\nThe Company depends on hiring an adequate number of hourly employees to run its business and is subject to regulations concerning these and its other employees, including wage and hour regulations.\nThe Company\u2019s workforce is comprised primarily of employees who work on an hourly basis. To grow its operations and meet the needs and expectations of its customers, the Company must attract, train, and retain a large number of hourly associates, while at the same time controlling labor costs. These positions have historically had high turnover rates, which can lead to increased training, retention and other costs and impair the overall customer service and efficiencies at the Company\u2019s stores. In certain areas where the Company operates, there is significant competition for employees, including from retailers and the restaurant industries. The lack of availability of an adequate number of hourly employees, or the Company\u2019s inability to attract and retain them, or an increase in wages and benefits to current employees could adversely affect its business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. The Company is subject to applicable rules and regulations relating to its relationship with its employees, including wage and hour regulations, health benefits, unemployment and payroll taxes, overtime and working conditions, immigration status and, in Mexico, future labor agreements and union relations under the FLL. Accordingly, federal, state or local legislated increases in the minimum wage, as well as increases in additional labor cost components such as employee benefit costs, workers\u2019 compensation insurance rates, compliance costs, fines and, in Mexico, costs associated with labor agreements and unions, would increase the Company\u2019s labor costs, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s organic growth is subject to external factors and other circumstances over which it has limited control or that are beyond its control. These factors and circumstances could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to grow through the opening of new store locations.\nThe success of the Company\u2019s organic expansion strategy is subject to numerous external factors, such as the availability of sites with favorable customer demographics, limited competition, acceptable regulatory restrictions and landscape, political or community acceptance, suitable lease terms, its ability to attract, train and retain qualified associates and management personnel, the ability to obtain required government permits and licenses and the ability to identify attractive acquisition targets and complete such acquisitions. Some of these factors are beyond the Company\u2019s control. The failure to execute the Company\u2019s organic expansion strategy would adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to expand its business and could materially adversely affect its business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe inability to successfully identify attractive acquisition targets, realize administrative and operational synergies and integrate completed acquisitions could adversely affect results.\nThe Company has historically grown, in large part, through strategic acquisitions, and the Company\u2019s strategy is to continue to pursue attractive acquisition opportunities if and when they become available. The success of an acquisition is subject to numerous internal and external factors, such as competition rules, the ability to consolidate information technology and accounting functions, the management of additional sales, administrative, operations and management personnel, overall management of a larger organization, competitive market forces, and general economic and regulatory factors. It is possible that the integration process could result in unrealized administrative and operational synergies, the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing businesses, tax costs or inefficiencies, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, information technology systems, procedures and policies, any of which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to maintain relationships with customers, employees, or other third-parties or the Company\u2019s ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions and could harm its financial performance. Furthermore, future acquisitions may be in jurisdictions in which the Company does not currently operate, which could make the successful consummation and integration of any such acquisitions more difficult. Attractive acquisition targets may also become increasingly scarce in future periods or in jurisdictions the Company would like to expand its operations in. Failure to successfully integrate an acquisition could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition, and failure to successfully identify attractive acquisition targets and complete such acquisitions on favorable terms could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s growth. Additionally, any acquisition has the risk that the Company may not realize a return on the acquisition or the Company\u2019s investment.\nThe Company\u2019s future success is largely dependent upon the ability of its management team to successfully execute its business strategy.\nThe Company\u2019s future success, including its ability to achieve its growth and profitability goals, is dependent on the ability of its management team to execute on its long-term business strategy, which requires them to, among other things: (1) successfully open new pawn stores, (2) identify attractive acquisition opportunities, close on such acquisitions on favorable terms and successfully integrate acquired businesses, (3) encourage and improve customer traffic at its pawn stores, (4) improve the customer experience at its pawn stores, (5) enhance productivity of its pawn stores, including through investments in technology, (6) control expenses in line with their current projections, (7) maintain and enhance the Company\u2019s reputation, and (8) effectively maintain its compliance programs and respond to regulatory developments and changes that impact its business. Failure of management to execute its business strategy could negatively impact the Company\u2019s business, growth prospects, financial condition or results of operations. Further, if the Company\u2019s growth is not effectively managed, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects could be negatively affected, and the Company may not be able to continue to implement its business strategy and successfully conduct its operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business depends on the uninterrupted operation of the Company\u2019s facilities, systems and business functions, including its information technology and other business systems, and reliance on other companies to provide key components of its business systems.\nThe Company\u2019s business depends highly upon its employees\u2019 ability to perform, in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion, necessary business functions such as operating, managing and securing its retail locations, technical support centers, call centers, security monitoring, treasury and accounting functions and other administrative support functions. Additionally, the Company\u2019s storefront operations depend on the efficiency and reliability of the Company\u2019s proprietary point-of-sale and loan management system. A shut-down of or inability to access the facilities in which the Company\u2019s storefront point-of-sale and loan management system and other technology infrastructure are based, such as due to a power outage, a cyber-security breach or attack, a breakdown or failure of one or more of its information technology, telecommunications or other systems, or sustained or repeated disruptions of such systems could significantly impair its ability to perform such functions on a timely basis and could result in a deterioration of the Company\u2019s ability to perform efficient storefront lending and merchandise disposition activities, provide customer service, perform collection activities, or perform other necessary business functions.\nFurthermore, third parties provide a number of the key components necessary to the Company\u2019s business functions and systems. While the Company has carefully selected these third-party vendors and has ongoing programs to review these vendors and assess risk associated therewith, the Company does not control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including those resulting from disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, cyber-attacks and security breaches, regulatory restrictions, fines, or orders or other regulatory action causing reputational harm, failure of a vendor to provide services for any reason or poor performance of services, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to deliver products and services to its customers and otherwise conduct its business. Financial or operational difficulties of a third-party vendor could also hurt its operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendor's ability to serve the Company. Furthermore, the Company\u2019s vendors could also be sources of operational and information security risk to the Company, including from breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints. Replacing these third-party vendors could also create significant delay and expense. Accordingly, use of such third parties creates an unavoidable inherent risk to the Company\u2019s business and operations.\nSecurity breaches, cyber attacks or fraudulent activity could result in damage to the Company\u2019s operations or lead to reputational damage and expose the Company to significant liabilities.\nAn important component of the Company\u2019s business involves the receipt and storage of information about its customers and employees and maintaining internal business data. As a large employer and operator of retail stores and provider of pawn loans and other consumer financing produces, the Company is under threat of loss due to the velocity and sophistication of security breaches and cyber attacks. These security incidents and cyber attacks may be in the form of computer hacking, acts of vandalism or theft, malware, computer viruses or other malicious codes, phishing, employee error or malfeasance, catastrophes or unforeseen events or other cyber-attacks. A security breach of the Company\u2019s computer systems, or those of the Company\u2019s third-party service providers, including as a result of cyber attacks, could cause loss of Company assets, interrupt or damage its operations or harm its reputation. In addition, the Company could be subject to liability if confidential customer or employee information is misappropriated from its computer systems. Any compromise of security, including security breaches perpetrated on persons with whom the Company has commercial relationships, that results in the unauthorized access to or use of personal information or the unauthorized access to or use of confidential employee, customer, supplier or Company information, could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to the Company\u2019s reputation, and a loss of confidence of the Company\u2019s customers, vendors and others, which could harm its business and operations. Any compromise of\nsecurity could deter people from entering into transactions that involve transmitting confidential information to the Company\u2019s systems and could harm relationships with the Company\u2019s suppliers, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business. Actual or anticipated cyber attacks may cause the Company to incur substantial costs, including costs to investigate, deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees and engage third-party experts and consultants. Despite the implementation of significant security measures, these systems may still be vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses, programming errors, attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems. The Company may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber attacks.\nThe techniques that are used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and are difficult to detect for long periods of time. Accordingly, the Company and its third-party service providers may be unable to anticipate and prevent all data security incidents. If the Company or its vendors experience significant data security breaches or fail to detect and appropriately respond to significant data security breaches, the Company could be exposed to litigation, fines or other costs, its operations could be disrupted, and employees and customers could lose confidence in the ability to protect their information, which could cause them to stop doing business with the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s customers provide personal information in one of four ways: (1) when conducting a pawn transaction or selling merchandise, (2) when conducting a background check in connection with releasing or selling firearms, (3) during a consumer loan transaction (when personal and bank account information is necessary for approving this transaction), and (4) when conducting a retail purchase whereby a customer\u2019s payment method is via a credit card, debit card or check. While the Company has implemented systems and processes to protect against unauthorized access to or use of such personal information, there is no guarantee that these procedures are adequate to safeguard against all security breaches or misuse of the information. Furthermore, the Company relies on encryption and authentication technology to provide security and authentication to effectively secure transmission of confidential information, including customer bank account, credit card information and other personal information. However, there is no guarantee that these systems or processes will address all of the cyber threats that continue to evolve.\nIn addition, many of the third parties who provide products, services, or support to the Company could also experience any of the above cyber risks or security breaches, which could impact the Company\u2019s customers and its business and could result in a loss of customers, suppliers, Company assets or revenue.\nLastly, the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy is increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to the Company\u2019s business, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs. These costs associated with information security, such as increased investment in technology or investigative expenses, the costs of compliance with privacy laws, and fines, penalties and costs incurred to prevent or remediate information security or cyber breaches, could be substantial and adversely impact the Company\u2019s business. Even if the Company is fully compliant with legal standards and contractual or other requirements, it still may not be able to prevent security breaches involving sensitive data. The sophistication of efforts by hackers to gain unauthorized access to information technology systems continues to increase. Breaches, thefts, losses or fraudulent uses of customer, employee or Company business data could cause employees and customers to lose confidence in the security of its systems including the point-of-sale system and other information technology systems and choose not to do business with the Company. Such security breaches also could expose the Company to risks of data loss, business disruption, litigation and other costs or liabilities, any of which could adversely affect the business.\nBecause the Company maintains a significant supply of cash, loan collateral and inventories in its stores and certain processing centers, the Company may be subject to employee and third-party robberies, riots, looting, burglaries and thefts. The Company also may be subject to liability as a result of crimes at its stores.\nThe Company\u2019s business requires it to maintain a significant supply of cash, loan collateral and inventories, including gold and other precious metals, in most of its stores and certain corporate locations. As a result, the Company is subject to the risk of riots, looting, robberies, burglaries and thefts. Although the Company has implemented various programs in an effort to reduce these risks and utilizes various security measures at its facilities, there can be no assurance that riots, looting, robberies, burglaries and thefts will not occur. The extent of the Company\u2019s cash, loan collateral and inventory losses or shortages could increase as it expands the nature and scope of its products and services. Riots, looting, robberies, burglaries and thefts could lead to losses and shortages and could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. It is also possible that violent crimes such as riots, assaults and armed robberies may be committed at the Company\u2019s stores. The Company could experience liability or adverse publicity arising from such crimes. For example, the Company may be liable if an employee, customer, guard or bystander suffers bodily injury or other harm. Any such event may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company maintains a program of insurance coverage for various types of property, casualty and other risks. The types and amounts of insurance that the Company obtains vary from time to time, depending on availability, cost and management\u2019s decisions with respect to risk retention. The Company\u2019s insurance policies are subject to deductibles and exclusions that result in the Company\u2019s retention of a level of risk on a self-insurance basis. Losses resulting from employee and third-party robberies, riots, looting, burglaries and thefts not covered by insurance could be substantial and may increase the Company\u2019s expenses, which could harm the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nIf the Company is unable to protect its intellectual property rights, its ability to compete could be negatively impacted.\nThe success of the Company\u2019s business depends to a certain extent upon the value associated with its intellectual property rights, including its proprietary, internally developed point-of-sale and loan management system that is in use in all of its stores. The Company uses the trademarks \u201cFirstCash,\u201d \u201cFirst Cash,\u201d \u201cFirst Cash Pawn,\u201d \u201cCash America,\u201d \u201cCashland,\u201d \u201cFirst Cash Empe\u00f1o y Joyeria,\u201d \u201cCash Ya,\u201d \u201cCash & Go,\u201d \u201cCA,\u201d \u201cPresta Max,\u201d \u201cRealice Empe\u00f1os,\u201d \u201cEmpe\u00f1os Mexicanos\u201d and \u201cPrendamex\u201d along with numerous other trade names as described herein. The Company relies on a combination of trademarks, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary software, website domain names and other rights, including confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect its proprietary technology, processes and other intellectual property. While the Company intends to vigorously protect its trademarks and proprietary point-of-sale and loan management system against infringement, it may not be successful. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. The costs required to protect the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights and trademarks could be substantial.\nThe Company\u2019s lending and retail businesses are somewhat seasonal, which causes the Company\u2019s revenues and operating cash flows to fluctuate and may adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to service its debt obligations.\nThe Company\u2019s U.S. pawn and consumer lending business typically experiences reduced demand in the first and second quarters as a result of its customers\u2019 receipt of federal tax refund checks typically in February of each year. Demand for the Company\u2019s U.S. lending services is generally greatest during the third and fourth quarters. Also, retail sales are seasonally higher in the fourth quarter associated with holiday shopping and, to a lesser extent, in the first quarter associated with tax refunds in the U.S. Typically, the Company experiences seasonal growth of service fees in the third and fourth quarter of each year due to loan balance growth. Service fees generally decline in the first and second quarter of each year due to the typical repayment of pawn loans associated with statutory bonuses received by customers in the fourth quarter in Mexico and with tax refund proceeds typically received by customers in the first quarter in the U.S. This seasonality requires the Company to manage its cash flows over the course of the year. If a governmental authority were to pursue economic stimulus actions or issue additional tax refunds, tax credits or other statutory payments at other times during the year, such actions could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition during these periods. If the Company\u2019s revenues were to fall substantially below what it would normally expect during certain periods, the Company\u2019s annual financial results and its ability to service its debt obligations could be adversely affected.\nThe failure or inability of third-parties who provide products, services or support to the Company to maintain their products, services or support could disrupt Company operations or result in a loss of revenue.\nThe Company\u2019s lending, pawn retail, scrap jewelry and cash management operations are dependent upon the Company\u2019s ability to maintain retail banking and borrowing relationships with commercial banks. Actions by federal regulators in the U.S. and other Latin American countries where the Company operates have caused many commercial banks, including certain banks used by the Company, to cease offering such services to the Company and other companies in the Company\u2019s industry. The Company also relies significantly on outside vendors to provide services such as financial transaction processing (including foreign exchange), utilities, store security, armored transport, precious metal smelting, data and voice networks and other information technology products and services. The failure or inability of any of these third-party financial institutions or vendors to provide such services could limit the Company\u2019s ability to grow its business and could increase the Company\u2019s costs of doing business, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations if the Company is unable to timely replace them with comparable service providers at a comparable cost.\nRegulatory, Legislative and Legal Risks\nThe Company\u2019s products and services are subject to extensive regulation and supervision under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations in both the U.S. and Latin America. If changes in regulations affecting the Company\u2019s pawn business create increased restrictions, or have the effect of prohibiting pawn loans in the jurisdictions where the Company currently operates, such regulations could materially impair or reduce the Company\u2019s pawn business and limit its expansion into new markets.\nThe Company\u2019s products and services are subject to extensive regulation and supervision under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations in both the U.S. and Latin America. The Company faces the risk that restrictions or limitations on pawn loans resulting from the enactment, change, or interpretation of laws and regulations in the U.S. or Latin America could have a negative effect on the Company\u2019s business activities. In addition, certain consumer advocacy groups, federal, state and local legislators and governmental agencies have also asserted that rules, laws and regulations should be tightened so as to severely limit, if not eliminate, the availability of pawn transactions and buy/sell agreements to consumers. It is difficult to assess the likelihood of the enactment of any unfavorable federal or state legislation or local ordinances, and there can be no assurance that additional legislative, administrative or regulatory initiatives will not be enacted that would severely restrict, prohibit, or eliminate the Company\u2019s ability to offer certain products and services.\nIn Latin America, restrictions and regulations affecting pawn transactions and buy/sell agreements, including licensing requirements for pawn stores and their employees, customer identification requirements, suspicious activity reporting, disclosure requirements and limits on interest rates, loan service fees, or other fees have been and continue to be proposed from time to time. Adoption of such federal, state or local regulation or legislation in the U.S. and Latin America could restrict, or even eliminate, the availability of pawn transactions and buy/sell agreements at some or all of the Company\u2019s locations, which would adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations and financial condition.\nThe extent of the impact of any future legislative or regulatory changes will depend on the political climate, the nature of the legislative, administrative or regulatory change, the jurisdictions to which the new or modified laws would apply, and the amount of business the Company does in that jurisdiction. Moreover, similar actions by states or foreign countries in which the Company does not currently operate could limit its opportunities to pursue its growth strategies. A more detailed discussion of the regulatory environment and current developments and risks to the Company is provided in \u201cBusiness-Governmental Regulation.\u201d\nThe CFPB has regulatory, supervisory and enforcement powers over providers of consumer financial products and services in the U.S., and it could exercise its enforcement powers in ways that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and financial results.\nThe CFPB has been exercising its supervisory review over certain non-bank providers of consumer financial products and services, including providers of consumer loans and certain title pawn loans such as the Company. The CFPB\u2019s examination authority permits its examiners to inspect the books and records of providers of short-term, small dollar lenders, such as the Company, and ask questions about their business practices. As a result of these examinations of non-bank providers of consumer credit, the Company could be required to discontinue certain services or products, or change its practices or procedures, whether as a result of another party being examined or as a result of an examination of the Company, and could be subject to specific enforcement action, including monetary penalties, which could adversely affect the Company. Under certain circumstances, the CFPB may also be able to exercise regulatory or enforcement authority over providers of pawn services through its rule making authority.\nIn addition to having the authority to assess monetary penalties for violations of applicable federal consumer financial laws (including the CFPB\u2019s own rules), the CFPB can require remediation of practices, including through confidential memorandums of understanding and consent orders, pursue administrative proceedings or litigation and obtain cease and desist orders (which can include orders for restitution or rescission of contracts, as well as other kinds of affirmative or equitable relief). Also, where a company has violated Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act or CFPB regulations implemented under Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Dodd-Frank Act empowers state attorneys general and state regulators to bring civil actions to remedy alleged violations of state law. If the CFPB or one or more state attorneys general or state regulators believe that the Company has violated any of the applicable laws or regulations or any consent orders or confidential memorandums of understanding against or with the Company, they could exercise their enforcement powers in ways that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and financial results.\nSee \u201cItem 1. Business-Government Regulation\u201d for a further discussion of the regulatory authority of the CFPB.\nMexico\u2019s PROFECO has regulatory, supervisory and enforcement powers over pawn operators and pawn operations, and it could exercise its enforcement powers in ways that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and financial results.\nFederal law in Mexico provides for administrative regulation of the pawnshop industry by PROFECO, Mexico\u2019s primary federal consumer protection agency. PROFECO requires all pawn operators, like the Company, to register its pawn stores and to disclose the interest rate and fees charged on pawn transactions. PROFECO also establishes and regulates the form and non-financial terms of pawn contracts and defines certain operating standards and procedures for pawnshops and reporting requirements for pawnshops. PROFECO requires all pawn businesses and their owners to annually register with and be approved by PROFECO in order to legally operate. In addition, all operators must comply with additional customer notice and disclosure provisions, bonding requirements to insure against loss or insolvency, reporting of certain types of suspicious transactions and monthly reporting to state law enforcement officials of certain transactions (or series of transactions). There are significant fines and sanctions, including operating suspensions, for failure to register and/or comply with PROFECO\u2019s rules and regulations. PROFECO regularly modifies its processes and procedures regarding its annual registration requirements and pawn operations and the Company has complied and complies in all material respects with requirements as administered by PROFECO.\nThe adoption of new laws or regulations or adverse changes in, or the interpretation or enforcement of, existing laws or regulations affecting the Company\u2019s products and services could adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.\nGovernments, including agencies, at the national, state and local levels, may seek to enforce or impose new laws, regulatory restrictions, licensing requirements or taxes that affect the Company\u2019s products or services it offers, the terms on which it may offer them, and the disclosure, compliance and reporting obligations it must fulfill in connection with its business. They may also interpret or enforce existing requirements in new ways that could restrict the Company\u2019s ability to continue its current methods of operation or to expand operations, impose significant additional compliance costs, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, these measures could even directly prohibit some or all of the Company\u2019s current business activities in certain jurisdictions, or render them unprofitable and/or impractical to continue.\nMedia reports, statements made by regulators and elected officials and public perception in general of pawnshops as being predatory or abusive could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s pawn business. In recent years, consumer advocacy groups and some media reports, in both the U.S. and Latin America, have advocated governmental action to prohibit or place severe restrictions on pawn services.\nReports and statements made by consumer advocacy groups, members of the media, regulators and elected officials often focus on the annual or monthly cost to a consumer of pawn transactions, which are generally higher than the interest typically charged by banks to consumers with better credit histories. These reports and statements typically characterize pawn loans as predatory or abusive or focus on alleged instances of pawn operators purchasing or accepting stolen property as pawn collateral. If the negative characterization of pawnshops becomes increasingly accepted by consumers, demand for pawn loans could significantly decrease, which could materially affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, if the negative characterization of these types of transactions becomes increasingly accepted by legislators and regulators, the Company could become subject to more restrictive laws and regulations that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, any negative public perception of pawnshops generally would likely have a material negative impact on the Company\u2019s retail operations, including reducing the number of consumers willing to shop at the Company\u2019s stores.\nJudicial or administrative decisions, CFPB rule-making, amendments to the Federal Arbitration Act (the \u201cFAA\u201d) or new legislation could render the arbitration agreements the Company uses illegal or unenforceable.\nThe Company includes dispute arbitration provisions in its customer loan and pawn agreements. These provisions are designed to allow the Company to resolve any customer disputes through individual arbitration rather than in court. The Company\u2019s arbitration provisions explicitly provide that all arbitrations will be conducted on an individual and not on a class basis. Thus, the Company\u2019s arbitration agreements, if enforced, have the effect of mitigating class and collective action liability. The Company\u2019s arbitration agreements do not have any impact on regulatory enforcement proceedings. The Company takes the position that the FAA requires enforcement, in accordance with the terms of its arbitration agreements, of class and collective action waivers of the type the Company uses, particularly now that the CFPB\u2019s \u201cArbitration Rule\u201d prohibiting class action waivers was officially repealed in November 2017.\nIn the past, however, a number of state and federal circuit courts, including the California and Nevada Supreme Courts, and the National Labor Relations Board concluded that arbitration agreements with consumer class action waivers are \u201cunconscionable\u201d and hence unenforceable, particularly where a small dollar amount is in controversy on an individual basis. In April 2011, however,\nthe U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a 5-4 decision in AT&T Mobility v. Concepcion that the FAA preempts state laws that would otherwise invalidate consumer arbitration agreements with class action waivers. In December 2015, the Supreme Court in a 6-3 decision in DIRECTV, Inc. v. Imburgia upheld DIRECTV\u2019s service agreement that included a binding arbitration provision with a class action waiver, and declared that the arbitration clause at issue was governed by the FAA. The Company\u2019s arbitration agreements differ in some respects from the agreement at issue in Concepcion and DIRECTV and some courts have continued, in the aftermath of Concepcion, to find reasons to rule that arbitration agreements are unenforceable.\nIn light of conflicting court decisions and potential future CFPB rulemaking, including enactment of the proposed Credit Act, it is possible that the Company\u2019s arbitration agreements will be rendered unenforceable. Additionally, Congress has considered legislation that would generally limit or prohibit mandatory dispute arbitration in certain consumer contracts, and it has adopted such prohibitions with respect to certain mortgage loans and certain consumer loans to active-duty members of the military and their dependents.\nAny judicial or administrative decision, federal legislation or CFPB rule that would impair the Company\u2019s ability to enter into and enforce consumer arbitration agreements with class action waivers could significantly increase the Company\u2019s exposure to class action litigation as well as litigation in plaintiff friendly jurisdictions. Such litigation could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCurrent and future litigation or regulatory proceedings, both in the U.S. and Latin America, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company or its subsidiaries has been or may be involved in future lawsuits, regulatory or administrative proceedings, examinations, investigations, consent orders, memorandums of understanding, audits, other actions arising in the ordinary course of business, including those related to consumer finance and protection, federal or state wage and hour laws, product liability, unclaimed property, employment, personal injury and other matters that could cause it to incur substantial expenditures and generate adverse publicity. In particular, the Company may be involved in lawsuits or regulatory actions related to consumer finance and protection, employment, marketing, unclaimed property, competition matters, and other matters, including class action lawsuits brought against it for alleged violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act, state wage and hour laws, state or federal advertising laws, consumer protection, lending and other laws. The consequences of defending proceedings or an adverse ruling in any current or future litigation, judicial or administrative proceeding, including consent orders or memorandums of understanding, could cause the Company to incur substantial legal fees, to have to refund fees and/or interest collected, refund the principal amount of advances, pay treble or other multiple damages, pay monetary penalties, fines, and/or modify or terminate the Company\u2019s operations in particular states or countries. Defense or filing of any lawsuit or administrative proceeding, even if successful, could require substantial time, resources, and attention of the Company\u2019s management and could require the expenditure of significant amounts for legal fees and other related costs. Settlement of lawsuits or administrative proceedings may also result in significant payments and modifications to the Company\u2019s operations. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, administrative proceedings and other claims, the Company cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such matters.\nAdverse court and administrative interpretations or enforcement of the various laws and regulations under which the Company operates could require the Company to alter the products that it offers or cease doing business in the jurisdiction where the court, state or federal agency interpretation and enforcement is applicable. The Company is also subject to regulatory proceedings, and the Company could suffer losses from interpretations and enforcement of state or federal laws in those regulatory proceedings, even if it is not a party to those proceedings. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition and could impair the Company\u2019s ability to continue current operations. Besides regulation specific to consumer lending, which is discussed previously, the Company\u2019s pawn, credit services and consumer loan businesses are subject to other federal, state and local regulations, tax laws and import/export laws, including, but not limited to, the Dodd-Frank Act, Unfair Deceptive or Abusive Acts and Practices, Federal Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z adopted thereunder, Fair Debt Collections Practices Act, Military Lending Act, Bank Secrecy Act, Money Laundering Suppression Act of 1994, USA PATRIOT Act, Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Electronic Funds Transfer Act, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. In addition, the Company\u2019s marketing efforts and the representations the Company makes about its products and services are subject to federal and state unfair and deceptive practice statutes, including the Federal Trade Commission Act and analogous state statutes under which the Federal Trade Commission, state attorneys general or private plaintiffs may bring legal actions. If the Company is found to have engaged in an unfair and deceptive practice, it could have a material adverse effect on its business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company sells products manufactured by third parties, some of which may be defective. Many such products are manufactured overseas in countries which may utilize quality control standards that vary from those legally allowed or commonly accepted in the U.S., which may increase the Company\u2019s risk that such products may be defective. If any products that the Company sells were to cause physical injury or injury to property, the injured party or parties could bring claims against the Company as the\nretailer of the products based upon strict product liability. In addition, the Company\u2019s products are subject to the federal Consumer Product Safety Act and the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act, which empower the Consumer Product Safety Commission to protect consumers from hazardous products. The Consumer Product Safety Commission has the authority to exclude from the market and recall certain consumer products that are found to be hazardous. Similar laws exist in some states and cities in the U.S. If the Company fails to comply with government and industry safety standards, the Company may be subject to claims, lawsuits, product recalls, fines and negative publicity that could have a material adverse effect on its business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nMany of the Company\u2019s U.S. stores sell firearms, ammunition and certain related accessories, which may be associated with an increased risk of injury and related lawsuits. The Company may incur losses due to lawsuits relating to its performance of background checks on firearms purchases as mandated by state and federal law, the selling of firearms or the improper use of firearms sold by the Company, including lawsuits by individuals, municipalities or other organizations attempting to recover damages or costs from firearms retailers relating to the misuse of firearms. Commencement of such lawsuits against the Company could have a material adverse effect on its business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company is also subject to similar applicable laws and regulations in Latin America. For example, Mexico\u2019s Anti-Money Laundering Law, which requires monthly reporting of certain transactions (or series of transactions) exceeding monetary limits, and require stricter maintenance of customer identification records and controls, and reporting of all foreign (non-Mexican) customer transactions. Guatemala, El Salvador and Colombia also have similar reporting requirements. The Company is also subject to the terms and enforcement of the Mexico Privacy Law, which requires companies to protect their customers\u2019 personal information, among other things including mandatory disclosures.\nCertain state and local governmental entities in Latin America also regulate pawn, other consumer finance and retail businesses through state laws and local zoning and permitting ordinances. State and local agencies, including local police authorities, often have unlimited, broad and discretionary authority to interpret and apply laws, and suspend store operations pending investigation of suspicious pawn transactions and resolution of actual or alleged regulatory, licensing and permitting issues, among other issues.\nCompliance with applicable laws and regulations is costly, can affect operating results and may result in operational restrictions. The Company\u2019s failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject it to regulatory enforcement actions, result in the assessment against the Company of civil, monetary, criminal or other penalties, require the Company to abandon operations or certain product offerings, refund interest or fees, result in a determination that certain loans are not collectible, result in a revocation of licenses, or cause damage to its reputation, brands and customer relationships, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe sale and ownership of firearms, ammunition and certain related accessories is subject to current and potential regulation, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s reputation, business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nBecause the Company sells firearms, ammunition and certain related accessories, the Company is required to comply with federal, state and local laws and regulations pertaining to the purchase, storage, transfer and sale of such products, and the Company is subject to reputational harm if a customer purchases a firearm that is later used in a deadly shooting. These laws and regulations require the Company, among other things, to ensure that each pawn location offering firearms has its FFL, that all purchasers of firearms are subjected to a pre-sale background check, to record the details of each firearm sale on appropriate government-issued forms, to record each receipt or transfer of a firearm and to maintain these records for a specified period of time. The Company is also required to timely respond to traces of firearms by law enforcement agencies. Over the past several years, the purchase, sale and ownership of firearms, ammunition and certain related accessories has been the subject of increased media scrutiny and federal, state and local regulation. The media scrutiny and regulatory efforts are likely to continue in the Company\u2019s current markets and other markets into which the Company may expand. If enacted, new laws and regulations could limit the types of licenses, firearms, ammunition and certain related accessories that the Company is permitted to purchase and sell and could impose new restrictions and requirements on the manner in which the Company offers, purchases and sells these products. If the Company fails to comply with existing or newly enacted laws and regulations relating to the purchase and sale of firearms, ammunition and certain related accessories, its licenses to sell or maintain inventory of firearms at its stores may be suspended or revoked, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, new laws and regulations impacting the ownership of firearms and ammunition could cause a decline in the demand for and sales of the Company\u2019s products, which could materially adversely impact its revenue and profitability. Complying with increased regulation relating to the sale of firearms, ammunition and certain related accessories could be costly.\nThe Company is subject to the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws, and the Company\u2019s failure to comply with these anti-corruption laws could result in penalties that could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company is subject to the FCPA, which generally prohibits companies and their agents or intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business and/or other benefits. Although the Company has policies and procedures designed to ensure that it, its employees, agents, and intermediaries comply with the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws, there can be no assurance that such policies or procedures will work effectively all of the time or protect the Company against liability for actions taken by its employees, agents, and intermediaries with respect to its business or any businesses that it may acquire. In the event the Company believes, or has reason to believe, its employees, agents, or intermediaries have or may have violated applicable anti-corruption laws in the jurisdiction in which it operates, including the FCPA, the Company may be required to investigate or have a third party investigate the relevant facts and circumstances, which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management. The Company\u2019s continued operation and expansion outside the U.S., especially in Latin America, could increase the risk, perceived or otherwise, of such violations in the future. If the Company is found to have violated the FCPA or other laws governing the conduct of business with government entities (including local laws), the Company may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures, which could have an adverse effect on its business, results of operations, and financial condition. Investigation of any potential or perceived violations of the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws by U.S. or foreign authorities could harm the Company\u2019s reputation and could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure to maintain certain criteria required by state and local regulatory bodies could result in fines or the loss of the Company\u2019s licenses to conduct business.\nMost states and many local jurisdictions both in the U.S. and in Latin America in which the Company operates require registration and licenses of stores and employees to conduct the Company\u2019s business. These states or their respective regulatory bodies have established criteria the Company must meet in order to obtain, maintain, and renew those licenses. For example, many of the states in which the Company operates require it to meet or exceed certain operational, advertising, disclosure, collection, and recordkeeping requirements and to maintain a minimum amount of net worth or equity. From time to time, the Company is subject to audits in these states to ensure it is meeting the applicable requirements to maintain these licenses. Failure to meet these requirements could result in substantial fines and penalties and/or store closures, which could include temporary suspension of operations, the revocation of existing licenses or the denial of new and renewal licensing requests. The Company cannot guarantee future license applications or renewals will be granted. If the Company were to lose any of its licenses to conduct its business, it could result in the temporary or permanent closure of stores, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe complexity of the political and regulatory environment in which the Company operates and the related cost of compliance are both increasing due to the changing political landscape, additional legal and regulatory requirements, the Company\u2019s ongoing expansion into new markets and the fact that foreign laws occasionally are vague or conflict with domestic laws. In addition to potential damage to the Company\u2019s reputation and brand, failure to comply with applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations such as those outlined above may result in the Company being subject to claims, lawsuits, fines and adverse publicity that could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nForeign Operations Risks\nThe Company\u2019s financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates in Latin American markets.\nThe Company derives significant revenue, earnings and cash flow from operations in Latin America, where business operations are transacted in Mexican pesos, Guatemalan quetzales and Colombian pesos. The Company\u2019s exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations results primarily from the translation exposure associated with the preparation of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements, as well as from transaction exposure associated with transactions and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the respective subsidiaries\u2019 functional currencies. While the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements are reported in U.S. dollars, the financial statements of the Company\u2019s Latin American subsidiaries are prepared using their respective functional currency and translated into U.S. dollars by applying appropriate exchange rates. As a result, fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar relative to the Latin American currencies could cause significant fluctuations in the value of the Company\u2019s assets, liabilities, stockholders\u2019 equity and operating results. In addition, while expenses with respect to foreign operations are generally denominated in the same currency as corresponding sales, the Company has transaction exposure to the extent expenditures are incurred in currencies other than the respective subsidiaries\u2019 functional currencies. The costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions also may increase as a result of adverse currency rate fluctuations. In addition, changes in currency\nrates could negatively affect customer demand, especially in Latin America and in U.S. stores located along the Mexican border. For a detailed discussion of the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates, see \u201cItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\u201d\nRisks and uncertainties related to the Company\u2019s foreign operations could negatively impact the Company\u2019s operating results.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company had 1,623 store locations in Latin America, including 1,548 in Mexico, 54 in Guatemala, 13 in El Salvador and eight in Colombia and the Company plans to open additional stores in Latin America in the future. Doing business in each of these countries, and in Latin America generally, involves increased risks related to geo-political events, political instability, corruption, economic volatility, property crime, drug cartel and gang-related violence, social and ethnic unrest including riots and looting, enforcement of property rights, governmental regulations, tax policies, banking policies or restrictions, foreign investment policies, public safety and security, anti-money laundering regulations, interest rate regulation and import/export regulations among others. As in many developing markets, there are also uncertainties as to how both local law and U.S. federal law is applied, including areas involving commercial transactions and foreign investment. As a result, actions or events could occur in Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador or Colombia that are beyond the Company\u2019s control, which could restrict or eliminate the Company\u2019s ability to operate some or all of its locations in these countries or significantly reduce customer traffic, product demand and the expected profitability of such operations.\nChanges impacting U.S. international trade and corporate tax provisions may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause international operations increase the complexity of an organization, the Company may face additional administrative costs in managing its business. In addition, most countries typically impose additional burdens on non-domestic companies through the use of local regulations, tariffs, labor controls and other federal or state requirements or legislation. As the Company derives significant revenue, earnings and cash flow from operations in Latin America, primarily in Mexico, there are some inherent risks regarding the overall stability of the trading relationship between Mexico and the U.S. and the burdens imposed thereon by any changes to (or the adoption of new) regulations, tariffs or other federal or state legislation. Specifically, the Company has significant exposure to fluctuations and devaluations of the Mexican peso and the health of the Mexican economy, which, in each case, may be negatively impacted by changes in U.S. trade treaties, including the proposed USMCA and corporate tax policy. In some cases, there have been negative reactions to the enacted and/or proposed policies as expressed in the media and by politicians in Mexico, which could potentially negatively impact U.S. companies operating in Mexico. In particular, there is uncertainty around the new presidential administration in Mexico and how the policies of this new administration, including support of social welfare programs, may impact U.S. companies doing business in Mexico generally and pawn and consumer finance companies in particular. While the Company engages in limited cross-border transactions other than those involving scrap jewelry sales, any such changes in regulations, trade treaties, corporate tax policy, import taxes or adverse court or administrative interpretations of the foregoing could adversely and significantly affect the Mexican economy and ultimately the Mexican peso, which could adversely and significantly affect the Company\u2019s financial position and results of the Company\u2019s Latin America operations.\nGeneral Economic and Market Risks\nA sustained deterioration of economic conditions or an economic crisis could reduce demand or profitability for the Company\u2019s products and services and increase credit losses which would result in reduced earnings.\nThe Company\u2019s business and financial results may be adversely impacted by sustained unfavorable economic conditions or unfavorable economic conditions associated with a global or regional economic crisis which, in either case, include adverse changes in interest or tax rates, effects of government initiatives to manage economic conditions and increased volatility of commodity markets and foreign currency exchange rates. Specifically, a sustained or rapid deterioration in the economy could cause deterioration in the performance of the Company\u2019s loan portfolios and in consumer or market demand for pre-owned merchandise or gold such as that sold in the Company\u2019s pawnshops. A sustained deterioration in the economy could reduce the demand and resale value of pre-owned merchandise and reduce the amount that the Company could effectively lend on an item of collateral. Such reductions could adversely affect pawn loan balances, pawn redemption rates, inventory balances, inventory mixes, sales volumes and gross profit margins.\nInclement weather, natural disasters or health epidemics can adversely impact the Company\u2019s operating results.\nThe occurrence of weather events and natural disasters such as rain, cold weather, snow, wind, storms, hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or health epidemics in the Company\u2019s markets could adversely affect consumer traffic, retail sales and loan origination or collection activities at the Company\u2019s stores and have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations. In addition, the Company may incur property, casualty or other losses not covered by insurance. Losses not covered by insurance\ncould be substantial and may increase the Company\u2019s expenses, which could harm the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nDeclines in commodity market prices of gold, other precious metals and diamonds could negatively affect the Company\u2019s profits.\nThe Company\u2019s profitability could be adversely impacted by commodity market fluctuations. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 57% of the Company\u2019s pawn loans were collateralized with jewelry, which is primarily gold, and 47% of its inventories consisted of jewelry, which is also primarily gold. The Company sells significant quantities of gold, other precious metals and diamonds acquired through collateral forfeitures or direct purchases from customers. A significant and sustained decline in gold and/or other precious metal and diamond prices could result in decreased merchandise sales and related margins, decreased inventory valuations and sub-standard collateralization of outstanding pawn loans. In addition, a significant decline in market prices could result in a lower balance of pawn loans outstanding for the Company, as customers would receive lower loan amounts for individual pieces of jewelry or other gold items. For a detailed discussion of the impact of a decline in market prices on wholesale scrap jewelry sales, see \u201cItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\u201d\nChanges in the capital markets or the Company\u2019s financial condition could reduce availability of capital on favorable terms, if at all.\nThe Company has, in the past, accessed the debt capital markets to refinance existing debt obligations and to obtain capital to finance growth. Efficient access to these markets is critical to the Company\u2019s ongoing financial success. However, the Company\u2019s future access to the debt capital markets could become restricted due to a variety of factors, including a deterioration of the Company\u2019s earnings, cash flows, balance sheet quality, regulatory restrictions, fines, or orders or other regulatory action causing reputational harm, or overall business or industry prospects, a significant deterioration in the state of the capital markets, including impacts of inflation or rising interest rates or a negative bias toward the Company\u2019s industry by market participants. Inability to access the credit markets on acceptable terms, if at all, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and ability to fund future growth.\nAdverse real estate market fluctuations and/or the inability to renew and extend store operating leases could affect the Company\u2019s profits.\nThe Company leases most of its locations. A significant rise in real estate prices or real property taxes could result in an increase in store lease costs as the Company opens new locations and renews leases for existing locations, thereby negatively impacting the Company\u2019s results of operations. The Company also owns certain developed and undeveloped real estate, which could be impacted by adverse market fluctuations. In addition, the inability of the Company to renew, extend or replace expiring store leases could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nA discussion of certain other market risks is covered in \u201cItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\u201d\nAccounting, Tax and Financial Risks\nThe Company's existing and future levels of indebtedness could adversely affect its financial health, its ability to obtain financing in the future, its ability to react to changes in its business and its ability to fulfill its obligations under such indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2019, including the Company's 5.375% senior unsecured notes issued in May 2017 (\u201cNotes\u201d) and the Company\u2019s unsecured credit facility, the Company had outstanding principal indebtedness of $635.0 million and availability of $161.7 million under its unsecured credit facility. The Company's level of indebtedness could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for it to satisfy its obligations with respect to the Notes and its other indebtedness, resulting in possible defaults on and acceleration of such indebtedness;\n\u2022\nrequire it to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flows to fund working capital, acquisitions, new store openings, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit its ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, acquisitions, new store openings, capital expenditures, debt service requirements and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit its ability to refinance indebtedness or cause the associated costs of such refinancing to increase;\n\u2022\nrestrict the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise transfer assets to the Company, which could limit its ability to, among other things, make required payments on its debt;\n\u2022\nincrease the Company's vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including interest rate fluctuations (because a portion of its borrowings are at variable rates of interest); and\n\u2022\nplace the Company at a competitive disadvantage compared to other companies with proportionately less debt or comparable debt at more favorable interest rates who, as a result, may be better positioned to withstand economic downturns.\nAny of the foregoing impacts of the Company's level of indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to goodwill impairment risk.\nAt December 31, 2019, the Company had $948.6 million of goodwill on its consolidated balance sheet, all of which represents assets capitalized in connection with the Company\u2019s acquisitions and business combinations. Accounting for goodwill requires significant management estimates and judgment. Management performs periodic reviews of the carrying value of goodwill to determine whether events and circumstances indicate that an impairment in value may have occurred. A variety of factors could cause the carrying value of goodwill to become impaired. A write-down of the carrying value of goodwill could result in a non-cash charge, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nUnexpected changes in both domestic and foreign tax policies could negatively impact the Company\u2019s operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s financial results may be negatively impacted by changes in domestic or foreign tax policies, including, but not limited to, an increase in statutory tax rates, changes in allowable expense deductions, or the imposition of new withholding requirements on repatriation of foreign earnings.\nCertain tax positions taken by the Company require the judgment of management and could be challenged by federal taxing authorities in the U.S. and Latin America.\nManagement\u2019s judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes, the deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. Management\u2019s judgment is also required in evaluating whether tax benefits meet the more-likely-than-not threshold for recognition under ASC 740-10-25, Income Taxes.", "PERMNO": 76856, "SIC": 5900, "TIC": "FCFS"}
