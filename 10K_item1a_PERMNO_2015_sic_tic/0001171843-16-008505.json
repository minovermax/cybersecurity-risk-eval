{"cik": "1365216", "company": "Sucampo Pharmaceuticals, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-11", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\t RISK FACTORS\nBefore deciding to purchase, hold or sell our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere and the other information contained in this report and in our other filings with the SEC, including subsequent Quarterly Reports on Forms 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. We operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business. These known and unknown risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, prospects, operating results or cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nIf we are unable to continue successful commercialization of AMITIZA for the approved indications and other indications or dosage forms for which we are developing this drug, or experience significant delays in doing so, our ability to generate royalty and product-based revenues and achieve profitability will be jeopardized.\nOur business currently depends entirely on the successful commercialization of our first product, lubiprostone. Lubiprostone was launched in the U.S. in 2006 under the brand name AMITIZA. AMITIZA is currently marketed in the U.S., U.K., Switzerland and Japan for various indications. We have a limited history of generating global revenues from the sale of lubiprostone. Prior to the acquisition of R-Tech (the Acquisition), R-Tech was responsible for the manufacture and supply of all of our drug products for commercial use and clinical development. Through the Acquisition, we obtained control over the manufacturing and supply chain of AMITIZA. This increased responsibility could detract attention from operating the day-to-day components of our business prior to the Acquisition.\nOur ability to meet expectations with respect to global sales of lubiprostone and revenues from such sales, and to attain profitability and maintain positive cash flow from the lubiprostone business, in the time periods we anticipate, or at all, will depend on a number of factors, including the following:\n\u00b7 our and our partners\u2019 ability to continue to build, and to maintain, market acceptance for lubiprostone among healthcare professionals and patients in the U.S., and to gain such market acceptance in the countries where lubiprostone is approved, or may in the future receive approval;\n\u00b7 the efforts of Takeda and Mylan to commercialize and maximize net sales revenue of AMITIZA;\n\u00b7 the degree to which both physicians and patients determine that the safety and side effect profiles of lubiprostone are manageable, and that the benefits of lubiprostone outweigh the risks;\n\u00b7 the current and future prevalence of CIC, IBS-C, OIC, or chronic constipation;\n\u00b7 the willingness of insurance companies, managed care organizations, other private payers, and government entities that provide reimbursement for medical costs in the U.S. to continue to provide reimbursement for lubiprostone at the prices at which we offer lubiprostone without imposing any additional major hurdles to access or other significant restrictions or limitations, and the ability and willingness of patients to commit to any co-pay amounts for lubiprostone applicable under their insurance coverage;\n\u00b7 our commercial partners\u2019 ability to obtain pricing approval and/or reimbursement required for selling lubiprostone in the major countries of the E.U., Japan and in other countries in which we may receive approval to market lubiprostone on a timely basis and at price levels that are acceptable to us without the applicable government agencies or other payers in such countries imposing onerous caps, rebate, risk sharing or other requirements which effectively and significantly lower the reimbursement rates for lubiprostone;\n\u00b7 the extent of the likely negative impact of the introduction of new competitive products on sales of lubiprostone;\n\u00b7 our ability to gain regulatory approval of lubiprostone outside the countries in which we have already received approval without restrictions that are substantially more onerous or manufacturing specifications that are more difficult to consistently achieve than those imposed in the U.S. and E.U.;\n\u00b7 our ability to accurately forecast revenues from sales of lubiprostone and the metrics that impact revenues, such as prescription rate, short-term and long-term drop-out rate, conversion rate, reimbursement and pricing; the timing and availability of named patient sales and the impact of future competition;\n\u00b7 our ability to successfully gain approval of a dosage form of lubiprostone for pediatric functional constipation, and to generate revenues from sales of the dosage form for pediatric functional constipation, if approved;\n\u00b7 successful completion of clinical trials of AMITIZA for the treatment of other constipation-related gastrointestinal indications beyond CIC, IBS-C and OIC as well as other dosage forms other than the 24 mcg and 8 mcg soft gelatin capsule, and successful commercialization of these indications and dosage forms within and outside the U.S.;\n\u00b7 our ability to manufacture sufficient bulk quantities of active pharmaceutical ingredient and sufficient quantities of each dosage strength and dosage form of lubiprostone to meet demand;\n\u00b7 our ability to hire and retain key personnel necessary to optimize the lubiprostone business; and\n\u00b7 our and our partners\u2019 ability to continue to execute effectively on key activities related to lubiprostone in the U.S. and to launch lubiprostone successfully in those key markets outside the U.S. in which we receive pricing and reimbursement approval, and the level of cost required to conduct such activities.\nAMITIZA faces significant competition from competitors\u2019 products like linaclotide and naloxegol, which, in addition to other factors, could in certain circumstances lead to a significant reduction in royalty revenues and product sales.\nAs a general matter, the pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive. To be successful, we must be able to, among other things, effectively discover, develop, test and obtain regulatory approvals for products. We or our partners must be able to effectively commercialize, market and promote approved products, including communicating the effectiveness, safety and value of products to actual and prospective customers and medical professionals. Many of our competitors have greater resources than we have. This enables them, among other things, to make greater investments in research and development, marketing and promotion.\nOur product, AMITIZA, faces competition from competitors\u2019 products. Specifically, AMITIZA faces competition from linaclotide which is approved for two of the three indications that AMITIZA has been approved in the U.S. and for IBS-C in certain European countries. Its manufacturer is seeking approval in other markets for IBS-C that we currently or intend to market AMITIZA. We also face competition from naloxegol which is approved for OIC in the U.S. and E.U. Competitor products such as linaclotide and naloxegol may be more effective or more effectively marketed and sold than AMITIZA is by our partners or by us. Alternatively, in the case of generic competition, including the generic availability of competitors\u2019 branded products, they may be equally safe and effective products that are sold at a substantially lower price than our products. As a result, if we fail to maintain its competitive position, this could have a material adverse effect on its business, cash flow, results of operations, financial position and prospects.\nDevelopments by our competitors, the entry of new competitors into the markets in which we compete, or consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry could make our products or technologies less competitive or obsolete. Our future growth depends, in part, on our ability to develop and introduce products which are more effective than those developed by our competitors. Royalties or sales from our existing products may decline rapidly if a new product is introduced that represents a substantial improvement over our existing products.\nOur future success depends upon our ability to develop new products, and new indications for existing products, that achieve regulatory approval for commercialization.\nFor our business model to be successful, we must continually develop, manufacture and commercialize new products or achieve approval for new indications or label extensions for the use of our existing products. Prior to commercialization, these new products and product indications must satisfy stringent regulatory standards and receive requisite approvals or clearances from regulatory authorities in the U.S. and other countries. The development, regulatory review and approval, and commercialization processes are time consuming, costly and subject to numerous factors that may delay or prevent the development, approval or clearance, and commercialization of new products, including legal actions brought by our competitors. To obtain approval or clearance of new indications or products, we must submit, among other information, the results of preclinical and clinical studies on the new indication or product candidate to the applicable regulatory authorities. The number of preclinical and clinical studies that will be required for regulatory approval varies depending on the regulatory authority, the new indication or product candidate, the disease or condition for which the new indication or product candidate is in development and the regulations applicable to that new indication or product candidate. Even if we believe that the data collected from clinical trials of new indications for our existing products or for our product candidates are promising, applicable regulatory authorities may find such data to be insufficient to support approval of the new indication or product. The regulatory authority can delay, limit or deny approval or clearance of a new indication or product candidate for many reasons, including:\n\u00b7 the product is not safe or effective either generally or for a new indication;\n\u00b7 our preclinical and clinical data is interpreted in different ways than we interpret that data;\n\u00b7 we may be required to perform post-marketing clinical studies; or\n\u00b7 there may be changes in the approval policies or adoption of new regulations.\nProducts that we are currently developing, other future product candidates or new indications or label extensions for our existing products, may or may not receive the regulatory approvals or clearances necessary for marketing or may receive such approvals or clearances only after delays or unanticipated costs.\nWe continue to rely on third parties for the successful commercialization of some of our drug products. The success of these third parties will affect our ability to continue to develop new drug candidates.\nFor most of our operating history, we have been a research and development company. As we continue to expand our management, organizational and operational capabilities, expand our global partnerships, develop our diversified product pipeline, acquire non-prostone clinical candidates, and enhance our capital structure, our operations will focus on organizing and staffing our company, building the necessary infrastructure to support these capabilities, developing the pipeline and non-prostone technologies which we may acquire, undertaking preclinical and clinical trials of our product candidates, and pursuing the regulatory approval processes for additional indications for AMITIZA. Though we will continue to rely upon Takeda and Mylan to commercialize AMITIZA in most of the world, we may not be able to cause these third parties to effectively market and sell AMITIZA. In addition, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications and delays as Takeda obtains regulatory approvals and establishes the commercial markets for AMITIZA outside of North America, Japan and China. As we continue to develop and seek regulatory approval of our product candidates, both within and outside the U.S., it could be difficult for us to access capital, to build the necessary infrastructure, to obtain and devote the resources necessary to obtain and develop product candidates, to effectively sell our products, and to provide resources to support commercialization of our products.\nWe are subject to on-going obligations to monitor the safety of our products and product candidates. Any failure to meet these obligations could adversely affect our ability to generate revenue.\nSafety problems or signals can arise as our products are marketed and our product candidates are evaluated in clinical trials. With our collaborators, we are required to continuously collect and assess adverse events reported to us and to communicate to regulatory agencies these adverse events and safety signals regarding our products. Regulatory agencies periodically perform inspections of our pharmacovigilance processes, including our adverse event reporting. If regulatory agencies determine that we or our collaborators have not complied with the applicable reporting or other pharmacovigilance requirements, we may become subject to additional inspections, warning letters or other enforcement actions, including monetary fines, marketing authorization withdrawal and other penalties.\nWe face potential product liability exposure, and, if claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability.\nThe use of lubiprostone or any other product candidate in clinical trials and the sale of AMITIZA or any other product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval expose us to the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers, healthcare providers or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our product and product candidates. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we could incur substantial liabilities. In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u00b7 decreased demand for lubiprostone or any other product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval;\n\u00b7 impairment of our business reputation and exposure to adverse publicity;\n\u00b7 increased warnings on product labels;\n\u00b7 withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u00b7 costs as a result of related litigation;\n\u00b7 distraction of management\u2019s attention from our primary business;\n\u00b7 substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants;\n\u00b7 loss of revenue; and\n\u00b7 the inability to successfully commercialize lubiprostone or any other product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval.\nWe have obtained product liability insurance coverage for both our clinical trials and our commercial exposures. However, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive, and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability. On occasion, large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects or warnings found to be inadequate. The cost of any product liability litigation or other proceedings, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. A product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to decline and, if the claim is successful and judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and adversely affect our business.\nRecent federal legislation, including potentially unfavorable pricing regulations or other healthcare reform initiatives, and other negative pricing trends could limit our ability to generate revenues.\nIn March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) was enacted in the U.S. In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the ACA. This legislation may have both immediate and long-term impacts on us. A number of the provisions of legislation require rulemaking action by governmental agencies to implement, many of which have not yet occurred. The laws change access to health care products and services and create new fees for the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. Future rulemaking could increase rebates, reduce prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, or require additional reporting and disclosure. We cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking.\nThe regulations that govern, among other things, regulatory approvals, coverage, pricing and reimbursement for new drug products vary widely from country to country. In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to successfully sell any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval.\nIn the U.S., the E.U., and other potentially significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and third-party payers are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which has resulted in lower average selling prices. Furthermore, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the U.S. and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the E.U. will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and usage, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in general.\nWe may generate growth through acquisitions and in-licensing and such strategy may not be successful if we are not able to identify suitable acquisition or licensing candidates, to negotiate appropriate terms of any such transaction or to successfully manage the integration of any acquisition.\nAs part of our business strategy, we intend to continue pursuing strategic acquisitions and in-licensing opportunities with third parties for our existing products and to complement our existing product pipeline. We have limited experience in completing acquisitions with third parties as well as performing under in-licensing agreements and we may not be able to identify appropriate acquisition or licensing candidates or to successfully negotiate the terms of any such transaction. The licensing and acquisition of pharmaceutical and biological products is a competitive area. A number of more established companies are also pursuing strategies to license or acquire products in the pharmaceutical field, and they may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash resources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities. If we are unable to successfully complete acquisitions or in-licensing transactions for suitable products and product candidates, our prospects for growth could suffer.\nEven if we are successful in completing one or more acquisitions, the failure to adequately address the financial, operational or legal risks of these transactions could harm our business. To finance an acquisition, we could be required to use our cash resources, issue potentially dilutive equity securities or incur or assume debt or contingent liabilities. Accounting for acquisitions can require impairment losses or restructuring charges, large write-offs of in-process research and development expense and ongoing amortization expenses related to other intangible assets. In addition, integrating acquisitions can be difficult, and could disrupt our business and divert management resources. If we are unable to manage the integration of any acquisitions successfully, our ability to develop new products and continue to expand our product pipeline may be impaired.\nThe acquisition of Sucampo AG (SAG), in December 2010 resulted in the issuance of two subordinated unsecured promissory notes in the aggregate amount of approximately $51.9 million to Ueno Trust and Kuno Trust. As of December 31, 2015, the outstanding balance on the notes was $17.7 million. However, on February 1, 2016, we repaid the entire outstanding balance of these notes.\nIn connection with the acquisition of R-Tech in October 2015, we entered into the Credit Facility and, under such facility, issued secured promissory notes in the aggregate amount of approximately $250.0 million to various lenders (the Term Notes). As of December 31, 2015, the outstanding balance on the Term Notes was $250.0 million. If we do not generate sufficient cash flows from our operations, we may not be able to pay the obligations of these notes on a timely basis, which may adversely affect our operating results. Our failure to comply with the covenants and/or obligations related to the Term Notes could result in an event of default, which could result in an immediate acceleration of the outstanding balance of the Term Notes and, if they are not repaid, foreclosure upon the assets securing our obligations under the Term Notes. These outcomes would materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition. As of December 31, 2015, we were compliant with our covenants and conditions under the Term Notes.\nRisks Related to Our Commercial Operations\nWe have a relatively short history of profitability. We may not maintain operating profitability in the future, and this could force us to delay, reduce or abandon our commercialization efforts or product development programs.\nWe have recorded net income since 2012. However, we expect to continue to incur significant and increasing expenses for at least the next several years as we continue our research activities, conduct development of the prostone technology, seek and develop non-prostone products and compounds, seek regulatory approvals for additional indications and additional territories for AMITIZA and for other drug candidates, and protect the patents of our products from generic challenges. Regulatory changes and changes in market conditions, including the generic competition, may require us to incur more expenses or change the timing of expenses such that we may incur unexpected losses. We may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. If we are unable to maintain profitability, the market value of our class A common stock may decline.\nWe may need substantial additional funding and be unable to raise capital when needed, which could force us to delay, reduce or abandon our commercialization efforts or product development programs.\nWe expect our research and development expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities. We may need substantial additional funding and be unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, which would force us to delay, reduce or abandon our development programs.\nWe have continued to finance much of our operations by payments received under our collaboration agreements with Takeda and Mylan. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and internally generated funds that we anticipate from AMITIZA royalty revenues and product sales will be sufficient to enable us to fund our current operating expenses but not for all of our future research and development programs. Our future funding requirements, however, will depend on many factors, including:\n\u00b7 actual levels of product royalty and product sales from AMITIZA;\n\u00b7 the cost of commercialization activities, including product marketing, sales and distribution;\n\u00b7 the scope and results of our research, preclinical and clinical development activities;\n\u00b7 the timing of, and the costs involved in, obtaining regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7 the costs involved in obtaining and maintaining proprietary protection for our products, technology and know-how, including litigation costs and the results of such litigation;\n\u00b7 our ability to recruit and retain internal qualified human resources to conduct these activities;\n\u00b7 the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses, products and technologies;\n\u00b7 the success of our collaboration with Takeda and Mylan;\n\u00b7 the success of the commercialization efforts of AMITIZA; and\n\u00b7 our ability to establish and maintain additional collaborations.\nIf we are required to raise additional funds from external sources, we might accomplish this through at-the-market sales, public or private equity offerings, debt financings or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements. If we raise additional funds by at-the-market sales or issuing equity securities, current stockholders may experience dilution. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties, it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights and related intellectual property to our technologies, research programs, products or product candidates.\nWe are developing internationally and licensing our products globally; therefore, we have an increased exposure to foreign political conditions and regulatory requirements and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nWe expect that we will continue to seek global opportunities for our products and to develop candidates internationally in the future. Such opportunities and development will inherently subject us to a number of risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u00b7 changes in international regulatory and compliance requirements that could restrict our ability to develop, market and sell our products;\n\u00b7 political and economic instability;\n\u00b7 diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries outside of the U.S.;\n\u00b7 trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;\n\u00b7 difficulty in staffing and managing international operations;\n\u00b7 differing labor regulations and business practices;\n\u00b7 potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;\n\u00b7 changes in international medical reimbursement policies and programs;\n\u00b7 financial risks such as longer payment cycles, difficulty collecting accounts receivable and exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; and\n\u00b7 regulatory and compliance risks that relate to maintaining accurate information and control over sales and distributors\u2019 and service providers\u2019 activities that may fall within the purview of the FCPA or similar foreign laws such as the U.K. Bribery Act.\nAny of these factors may, individually or as a group, have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. These or other similar risks could adversely affect our revenue and profitability. As we develop internationally, our exposure to these factors will increase.\nRisks Related to Product Pipeline\nIf our preclinical studies do not produce successful results or if our clinical trials do not demonstrate safety and efficacy in humans, our ability to develop and commercialize our pipeline will be impaired, which may jeopardize our business.\nBefore obtaining regulatory approval for the sale of our product candidates from our pipeline and from non-prostone acquisitions, we must conduct extensive preclinical tests and clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy in humans of our product candidates. Preclinical and clinical testing is expensive, is difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete, is subject to varying regulatory requirements and is uncertain as to outcome. Success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. A failure of one or more of our clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, preclinical testing and the clinical trial process that could delay or prevent our ability to receive regulatory approval or commercialize our product candidates, including:\n\u00b7 regulators or institutional review boards may not authorize us to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n\u00b7 clinical research organizations we retain to conduct clinical trials may not perform according to the terms of the contract, causing delays or negative results in the clinical trials;\n\u00b7 our preclinical tests or clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and as a result we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional preclinical testing or clinical trials or we may abandon projects that we consider to be promising;\n\u00b7 design of or enrollment in our clinical trials may be slower than we currently anticipate, resulting in significant delays, or participants may drop out of our clinical trials at rates that are higher than we had anticipated;\n\u00b7 we might have to suspend or terminate our clinical trials, or perform additional trials, if we discover that the participating patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u00b7 regulators or institutional review boards may require that we hold, suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7 the cost of our clinical trials may be greater than we currently anticipate;\n\u00b7 we might have difficulty obtaining sufficient quantities of the product candidate being tested to complete our clinical trials;\n\u00b7 any regulatory approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the product not commercially viable;\n\u00b7 many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, site selection, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, and marketing approved products than we do and smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies;\n\u00b7 the effects of our product candidates may not be the desired or anticipated effects or may include undesirable side effects, or the product candidates may have other unexpected characteristics; and\n\u00b7 if we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our product candidates beyond those that we currently contemplate, if we are unable to successfully complete our clinical trials or other testing or if the results of these trials or tests are not positive or are only modestly positive, we may be delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates, not be able to obtain marketing approval, or obtain approval for indications that are not as broad as those for which we apply.\nOur product development costs will also increase if we experience delays in testing or approvals. We do not know whether our clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, if at all. Significant clinical trial delays also could allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to commercialize our products or product candidates.\nWe may fail to select or capitalize on the most scientifically, clinically or commercially promising or profitable product candidates.\nWe continue to evaluate our business strategy and, as a result, may modify our strategy in the future. In this regard, we may, from time to time, focus our product development efforts on different product candidates or may delay or halt the development of various product candidates. As a result of changes in our strategy, we may change or refocus our existing product development, commercialization and manufacturing activities. This could require changes in our facilities and our personnel. Any product development changes that we implement may not be successful. In particular, we may fail to select or capitalize on the most scientifically, clinically or commercially promising or profitable product candidates. Our decisions to allocate our research and development, management and financial resources toward particular product candidates or therapeutic areas may not lead to the development of viable commercial products and may divert resources from better opportunities. Similarly, our decisions to delay or terminate product development programs may also prove to be incorrect and could cause us to miss valuable opportunities.\nWe may perform additional clinical trials for other indications or in support of applications for regulatory marketing approval in jurisdictions outside the U.S. for our products. These supplemental trials could be costly and could result in findings inconsistent with or contrary to our historic U.S. clinical trials.\nIn the future, we may be required, or we may elect, to conduct additional clinical trials of AMITIZA to improve the current label or address regulatory authorities concerns about AMITIZA. In addition, if we seek marketing approval from regulatory authorities in jurisdictions outside the U.S., they may require us to perform additional clinical trials that would be costly and difficult to know if there will be successful outcomes and to submit data from supplemental clinical trials in addition to data from the clinical trials that supported our U.S. filings with the FDA. Any requirements to conduct supplemental trials would add to the cost of developing our product candidates. Additional or supplemental trials could also produce findings that are inconsistent with the trial results we have previously submitted to the FDA, in which case we would be obligated to report those findings to the FDA. This could result in new restrictions on the existing marketing approval for AMITIZA or could force us to stop selling AMITIZA. Inconsistent trial results could also lead to delays in obtaining marketing approval in the U.S. for other indications for AMITIZA or for other product candidates and could cause regulators to impose restrictive conditions on marketing approvals and could even make it impossible for us to obtain marketing approval. Any of these results could materially impair our ability to generate revenues and to achieve or maintain profitability.\nOur agreements with makers of generic AMITIZA products are subject to government scrutiny in the U.S.\nWe are and have been involved in patent litigations that have resulted or may result in settlement agreements. We have filed our settlement and license agreements with Par and will file any future settlement agreements with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice for review. The FTC has, in the past, brought actions against some brand and generic companies that have entered into such agreements alleging violations of antitrust laws in connection therewith.\nWe may receive civil investigative demands from the FTC that requires us to provide the FTC information and documents relating to various settlement and other agreements with makers of generic AMITIZA products following patent infringement claims and litigation, and other efforts principally regarding AMITIZA. If the FTC believes that these or other agreements or efforts violates antitrust laws, it could challenge us through an administrative or judicial proceeding, which could result in the imposition of monetary and/or injunctive relief, including the invalidation of agreements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, any such litigation could be protracted, requiring a substantial commitment of our management\u2019s time and cash expenditures over multiple years.\nRisks Related to Manufacturing\nFollowing our acquisition of R-Tech, we now manufacture and supply the active ingredient for our product and product candidates. However, we have limited experience in the management of pharmaceutical manufacturing operations and still rely on third parties for encapsulation, packaging and other manufacturing activities. If we or our third party manufacturers are unable to manufacture AMITIZA or our other product candidates in sufficient quantities, at acceptable quality levels and at acceptable cost and if we are unable to identify a suitable replacement manufacturer, our sales of AMITIZA and our further clinical development and commercialization of other products could be delayed, prevented or impaired.\nAlthough we now control the manufacture and supply of AMITIZA and our other product candidates, following our acquisition of R-Tech, we have little experience in manufacturing pharmaceutical products. In addition, we currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on various third party suppliers to create the finished, packaged forms of AMITIZA, unoprostone, cobiprostone, and any future compounds that we may determine to develop or commercialize. We do not currently have an alternative source of supply for AMITIZA, unoprostone, or cobiprostone. If we are not able to supply AMITIZA or these other compounds on a timely basis, in sufficient quantities and at acceptable levels of quality and price, and if we are unable to identify an alternate manufacturer to perform these functions on acceptable terms, sales of AMITIZA would be significantly impaired, and our development programs could be seriously jeopardized.\nThe risks relating to the manufacture of our products include:\n\u00b7 we rely solely on our personnel, and that of our third party vendors, for quality assurance and their continued compliance with regulations relating to the manufacture of pharmaceuticals;\n\u00b7 our manufacturing capacity may not be sufficient to produce commercial quantities of our product, or to keep up with subsequent increases in the quantities necessary to meet potentially growing demand;\n\u00b7 we may not have access to the capital necessary to expand our manufacturing facilities in response to our needs;\n\u00b7 if our operations were to be interrupted, or were we to elect to contract with another manufacturer to supply us, it would be difficult and time consuming for us to find an alternate supplier and the change would need to be submitted to and approved by the FDA and/or foreign regulatory agencies;\n\u00b7 we rely on numerous sub-contractors to fulfill its manufacturing obligations, and any difficulty or disruption at one of these sub-contractors could jeopardize our ability to produce AMITIZA or our other products;\n\u00b7 we may experience events, such as a fire or natural disaster, that force us to stop or curtail production for an extended period; and\n\u00b7 we could encounter significant increases in labor, capital or other costs that would make it difficult to produce our products cost-effectively.\nIn addition, we currently use one supplier for a key ingredient used in the manufacture of prostones. We could experience delays in production should it become necessary to switch its source of supply for such ingredient to another supplier or to manufacture such ingredient itself. We have subcontracted with a single contract manufacturer to encapsulate the bulk form AMITIZA we supply into soft gelatin capsules and another manufacturer to package the final product for distribution in the U.S. If these subcontractors experience difficulties or delays in performing these services for any reason, our ability to deliver adequate supplies of finished product to physicians and patients will be impaired, which could cause us to lose revenues. In addition, any change in the party providing encapsulation of AMITIZA would need to be approved by the FDA and/or foreign regulatory agencies, and any change in the party packaging the product would need to be submitted to and reviewed by the FDA and/or foreign regulatory agencies, which could increase the time required to replace these subcontractors should that become necessary.\nOur current and anticipated future dependence upon these third parties for the manufacture of our products and product candidates may adversely affect our future revenues, our cost structure, our ability to expand globally and our ability to develop product candidates and commercialize any approved products on a timely and competitive basis. In addition, if our ability to manufacture prostones for our clinical trials is impaired for any reason, we likely would experience delays in advancing these trials while we seek to identify and qualify replacement suppliers. We may be unable to obtain replacement supplies on a timely basis, on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.\nWe and the other third-party manufacturers of our products and product candidates are subject to significant regulations governing manufacturing facilities and procedures.\nWe, our subcontractors and suppliers and any other potential manufacturer of our products or product candidates may fail to comply with the FDA\u2019s cGMP regulations or other governmental regulations. These regulations govern manufacturing processes and procedures and the implementation and operation of systems to control and assure the quality of products approved for sale. In addition, the FDA or other regulatory agencies outside the U.S. may at any time audit or inspect a manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with cGMP or similar regulations. Our failure, or the failure of our subcontractors and suppliers or any other third-party manufacturer we use, to comply with applicable manufacturing regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of our product candidates, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of product candidates or products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our products and product candidates.\nIf it were to become necessary for us to activate a second source of supply, we would compete with other companies for access to appropriate manufacturing facilities. Any such change would need to be submitted to and approved by the FDA and/or foreign regulatory agencies before commercial activities of AMITIZA or any other product could resume. Among manufacturers that operate under cGMP regulations, there are a limited number that would be both capable of manufacturing for us and willing to do so.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe depend significantly on our collaborations with Takeda, Mylan Gloria, and Santen and may depend in the future on collaborations with other third parties, to develop and commercialize our product candidates.\nA key element of our business strategy is to collaborate where appropriate with third parties, particularly leading pharmaceutical companies, to co-develop, commercialize and market our products and product candidates. We are currently party to the North America Takeda Agreement for the co-development and commercialization of AMITIZA for gastrointestinal indications in the U.S. and Canada, as well as to the Global License Agreement for AMITIZA whereby Takeda is responsible for all development, commercialization and regulatory activities other than in Canada, the U.S., Japan and the People\u2019s Republic of China.\nWe are also party to the Japan Mylan Agreement for the development and commercialization of AMITIZA in Japan. On May 5, 2015, we entered into a license agreement with Harbin Gloria Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd under which Gloria is responsible for all development, commercialization and regulatory activities for AMITIZA in the People\u2019s Republic of China. We have no commercial experience collaborating with Gloria, and consequently the compatibility of our two companies is unknown.\nWe are a party to the Santen Agreement for the distribution and commercialization of RESCULA in Japan.\nThe success of our collaboration arrangements will depend heavily on the efforts and activities of Takeda, Mylan, Gloria and Santen. The risks that we face in connection with these collaborations and that we anticipate being subject to in any future collaborations, include the following:\n\u00b7 our existing agreements are, and any future collaboration agreements that we may enter into are likely to be, subject to termination under various circumstances;\n\u00b7 our present and future collaborators may develop and commercialize, either alone or with others, products and services that are similar to or competitive with the products that are the subject of their collaboration with us;\n\u00b7 our present and future collaborators may underfund or not commit sufficient resources to the testing, marketing, distribution or other development of our products or may use committed resources inefficiently;\n\u00b7 we may become involved in disputes with our collaborators regarding operations, strategies, intellectual property or financial matters;\n\u00b7 our present and future collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may utilize our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our proprietary information or expose us to potential liability; and\n\u00b7 our present and future collaborators may change the focus of their development and commercialization efforts.\nThe ability of our products and product candidates to reach their potential could be limited if Takeda, Mylan, Gloria, Santen or any other future collaborators decrease or fail to increase spending relating to such products, fail to dedicate sufficient resources to developing or promoting our products or change their business focus.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily or may fail to meet established deadlines for the completion of these trials.\nWe generally do not have the independent ability to conduct global clinical trials for our product candidates. We rely on third parties, such as contract research organizations (CROs), clinical data management organizations, medical institutions, and clinical investigators, to perform this function. We use multiple CROs to coordinate the efforts of our clinical investigators and to accumulate the results of our trials. Our reliance on these third parties for clinical development activities reduces our control over these activities. Furthermore, these third parties may also have relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors.\nIn addition, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial. The FDA and foreign regulatory agencies require us to comply with standards, commonly referred to as cGCP, for conducting and recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. Our reliance on third parties that we do not control does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements.\nIf tax authorities disagree with our transfer pricing policies or other tax positions, we could become subject to significant tax liabilities.\nWe are a member of an affiliated group of entities, and have had and will continue to have significant commercial transactions with these entities. Furthermore, we operate a number of foreign subsidiaries. We expect to operate through a consolidated organizational structure and we expect to enter into commercial transactions with some of these entities or future subsidiaries on an ongoing basis. As a result of these transactions, we will be subject to complex transfer pricing and other tax regulations in both the U.S. and the other countries in which we and our affiliates operate. Transfer pricing regulations generally require that, for tax purposes, transactions between our subsidiaries and affiliates and us be priced on a basis that would be comparable to an arm\u2019s length transaction and that contemporaneous documentation be maintained to support the related party agreements. To the extent that U.S. or any foreign tax authorities disagree with our transfer pricing or other policies, we could become subject to significant tax liabilities and penalties related to prior, existing and future related party agreements. As of December 31, 2015, we performed updated tax analyses wherein liabilities for uncertain tax positions were recorded for certain state jurisdictions based on nexus related to the sourcing of revenues. Should the tax authorities in one or more of these states have different interpretations than us, we may be subject to additional tax liabilities.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe have received notifications from generic companies that they have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDA) with the FDA against our products. In response, we initiated patent infringement lawsuits against those generic companies which are ongoing as to certain of these companies and settled as to others. If we are unable to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for the intellectual property relating to our technology and products, the value of our technology and products will be adversely affected and our ability to derive revenue from our products would be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for the technology and know-how upon which our products are based, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights. The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our intellectual property will depend on our success, in obtaining effective claims and enforcing those claims once granted. The scope of protection afforded by a set of patent claims is subject to inherent uncertainty unless the patent has already been litigated and a court has ruled on the meaning of the claim language and other issues affecting how broadly a patent claim can be enforced. In some cases, we license patent applications from R-Tech instead of issued patents, and we do not know whether these patent applications will result in the issuance of any patents.\nOur licensed patents have recently been challenged in the U.S. for AMITIZA (lubiprostone) by Par and Dr. Reddy\u2019s Laboratories, Inc. (Dr. Reddy\u2019s) and for RESCULA (unoprostone isopropyl) by Par Pharmaceutical and Apotex through the filing of ANDAs by those generic companies with the FDA. Other licensed patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit the term of patent protection for lubiprostone, unoprostone isopropyl or our other products, diminish our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products, and materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. In response to the filed ANDAs, we filed patent infringement lawsuits regarding AMITIZA against Par and Dr. Reddy\u2019s. In October 2014, we resolved our patent litigation with Par in the U.S. related to our AMITIZA (lubiprostone) 8 mcg and 24 mcg soft gelatin capsule products in which we and R-Tech granted Par a non-exclusive license to market Par\u2019s generic version of lubiprostone 8 mcg soft gelatin capsule and 24 mcg soft gelatin capsule in the U.S. for the indications approved for AMITIZA beginning January 1, 2021, or earlier under certain circumstances. Beginning on January 1, 2021, Par will split with us the gross profits of the licensed products sold during the term of the agreement, which continues until each of our related patents has expired. In the event Par elects to launch an authorized generic form of lubiprostone, we agree to supply Par under the terms of a manufacturing and supply agreement at a negotiated price.\nIn November 2014, we, R-Tech, Takeda, and certain affiliates of Takeda filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against Dr. Reddy's. The lawsuit claims infringement of the same 7 patents listed in the FDA's Orange Book involved in the Par lawsuit, with the latest expiring in 2027. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, as a result of the patent infringement lawsuit, final FDA approval of Dr. Reddy's ANDA will be stayed up to 30 months from the date of receipt of the notice letter.\nIn February 2015, we and R-Tech executed a stipulation and license agreement (Stipulation Agreement) with Par Pharmaceutical for RESCULA (unoprostone isopropyl) ophthalmic solution 0.15% indicated for the lowering of intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Subject to the terms of the Stipulation Agreement, we and R-Tech are obligated to grant Par Pharmaceutical, prior to the expiration of the latest expiring patent relating to RESCULA, a non-exclusive license to market Par Pharmaceutical\u2019s generic version or authorized generic of unoprostone isopropyl ophthalmic solution 0.15% indicated for the lowering of intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension product in the U.S. Under such license, Par Pharmaceutical will split with us the gross profits of the generic or authorized generic version sold during the term of the Stipulation Agreement, which continues until the last of our patents relating to RESCULA have expired. In the event Par Pharmaceutical elects to so launch an authorized generic form of unoprostone isopropyl, we will supply Par Pharmaceutical under the terms of a manufacturing and supply agreement at a negotiated price.\nOn July 10, 2015, R-Tech filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against Apotex related to the ANDA previously filed by Apotex and described in further detail under the heading \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d. The lawsuit claims infringement of two patents that are listed in the FDA\u2019s Orange Book, with the latest expiring in 2021. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, as a result of the patent infringement lawsuit, final FDA approval of Apotex\u2019s ANDA will be stayed up to 30 months from the date of receipt of the notice letter.\nWe have certain patents on our products that expire in the near future. We may not be able to use other existing patents or patent applications to successfully protect our products from generic competition. In addition, changes in either patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the U.S. and other countries may diminish the value of our patents and other intellectual property or narrow the scope of the protection provided by these patents. Accordingly, we cannot determine the degree of future protection for our proprietary rights in the patents and patent applications. Furthermore, because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any of our product candidates can be commercialized, a related patent may expire or may remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the patent.\nPatents may not afford us protection against competitors with similar technology. Because patent applications in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all, and because publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain whether a judicial court will uphold the validity of a patent.\nIf our patent position does not adequately protect our product and product candidates, others could compete against us more directly, which would harm our business, possibly materially.\nThe patent rights relating to lubiprostone consist of 16 issued U.S. patents, and various issued European and Japanese patents. Our patent rights also include various U.S., European and Japanese patent applications relating to dosing regimens, pharmaceutical formulations and other claims. The U.S. patents relating to compositions of matter expire between 2020 and 2027. The other U.S. and foreign patents expire between 2020 and 2035.\nOur commercial success with respect to lubiprostone will depend significantly on our ability to protect our existing patent position with respect to lubiprostone as well as our ability to obtain and maintain adequate protection of other intellectual property for our technologies, product candidates and any future products in the U.S. and other countries.\nThe patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including our patent position, involve complex legal and factual questions, and, therefore, validity and enforceability cannot be predicted with certainty.\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain, and we cannot ensure that:\n\u00b7 we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications;\n\u00b7 we or our licensors were the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u00b7 others will not independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies;\n\u00b7 any of our pending patent applications or those we have licensed will result in issued patents;\n\u00b7 any of our patents or those we have licensed will be valid or enforceable;\n\u00b7 any patents issued to us or our licensors and collaborators will provide a basis for any additional commercially viable products, will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties;\n\u00b7 we will develop additional proprietary technologies or product candidates that are patentable; or\n\u00b7 the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which may prevent or delay our product development efforts and stop us from commercializing or increase the costs of commercializing our product and any product candidates.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. There could be issued patents of which we are not aware that our products or product candidates infringe. There also could be patents that we believe we do not infringe, but that we may ultimately be found to infringe.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Other parties may obtain patents in the future and allege that our products or product candidates or the use of our technologies infringes these patent claims or that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. Likewise, third parties may challenge or infringe upon our existing or future patents.\nProceedings involving our patents or patent applications or those of others could result in adverse decisions regarding:\n\u00b7 the patentability of our inventions relating to our product or any product candidates; and\n\u00b7 the enforceability, validity or scope of protection offered by our patents relating to our product or any product candidates.\nEven if we are successful in these proceedings, we may incur substantial costs and divert management\u2019s time and attention in pursuing these proceedings, which could have a material adverse effect on us. If we are unable to avoid infringing the patent rights of others, we may be required to seek a license, defend an infringement action or challenge the validity of the patents in court. Patent litigation is costly and time consuming. We may not have sufficient resources to bring these actions to a successful conclusion.\nIn addition, if we do not obtain a license, develop or obtain non-infringing technology, fail to defend an infringement action successfully or have infringed patents declared invalid, we may:\n\u00b7 incur substantial monetary damages;\n\u00b7 encounter significant delays in bringing our product candidates to market; and\n\u00b7 be precluded from manufacturing or selling our product candidates.\nIn such event, our business could be adversely affected, possibly materially.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Approval and Oversight\nIf we are not able to obtain required regulatory approvals, we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\nOur product candidates and the activities associated with their development and commercialization, including testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in and outside the U.S. Failure to obtain regulatory approval or appropriate pricing for a product candidate will prevent us from commercializing the product candidates.\nAs we increase our foreign license arrangements, we or our partner are seeking and will continue to seek approval in different territories. Different regulatory agencies may reach different decisions in assessing the approval and pricing of our product candidates. Securing regulatory approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data, information about product manufacturing processes and inspection of facilities and supporting information to the regulatory agencies for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate\u2019s safety and efficacy. Our future products may not be effective, may be only moderately effective or may prove to have undesirable side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that may preclude our obtaining regulatory approval or prevent or limit commercial use.\nThe process of obtaining regulatory approvals is expensive, often takes many years, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. Changes in the regulatory approval policy during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application, may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. The FDA and foreign regulatory agencies have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data are insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval of a product candidate. Any regulatory approval we ultimately obtain may be limited in scope or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the product not commercially viable. If any regulatory approval that we obtain is delayed or is limited, we may decide not to commercialize the product candidate after receiving the approval.\nWe may not be able to obtain orphan drug exclusivity for our product candidates. If our competitors are able to obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product that is competitive with one or more of our product candidates and we cannot show that our product candidate is clinically superior, we may not be able to have competing products approved by the applicable regulatory authority for a significant period of time.\nRegulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including Europe and the U.S., may designate drugs that target relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Generally, if a product with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a period of marketing exclusivity. The exclusivity applies only to the indication for which the drug has been designated and approved. The applicable exclusivity period is seven years in the U.S., but this period may be interrupted if a sponsor of a competitive product that is otherwise the same drug for the same use can show that its drug is clinically superior to our orphan drug candidate. The European exclusivity period is ten years, but may be reduced to six years if a drug no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation, including where it is shown that the drug is sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is no longer justified. We unsuccessfully sought orphan drug designation from EMA for cobiprostone for the treatment of oral mucositis and we may seek such status with additional product candidates. Even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for specified indications, we may not be able to maintain it if a competitor with a product that is otherwise the same drug can establish that its product is clinically superior.\nWe must comply with federal, state and foreign laws, regulations, and other rules relating to the health care business, and, if we are unable to fully comply with such laws, regulations and other rules, we could face substantial penalties.\nWe are or will be directly or indirectly through our collaborators, subject to extensive regulation by the federal government, the states and foreign countries in which we may conduct our business. The laws that directly or indirectly affect our ability to operate our business include the following:\n\u00b7 the federal Medicare and Medicaid Anti-Kickback law, which prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce either the referral of an individual, or furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid Programs;\n\u00b7 other Medicare laws, regulations, rules, manual provisions and policies that prescribe the requirements for coverage and payment for services performed by our customers, including the amount of such payment;\n\u00b7 the federal False Claims Act, which imposes civil and criminal liability on individuals and entities who submit, or cause to be submitted, false or fraudulent claims for payment to the government;\n\u00b7 the federal False Statements Act, which prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;\n\u00b7 the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits certain payments made to foreign government officials;\n\u00b7 state and foreign law equivalents of the foregoing and state laws regarding pharmaceutical company marketing compliance, reporting and disclosure obligations; and\n\u00b7 the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which changes access to healthcare products and services; creates new fees for the pharmaceutical and medical device industries; changes rebates and prices for health care products and services; and requires additional reporting and disclosure.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws, regulations, rules or policies described above or any other law or governmental regulation to which we or our collaborators are or will be subject, or if the interpretation of the foregoing changes, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Similarly, we do not control our collaborators, including their compliance activities and if our collaborators are found non-compliant with applicable laws, they may be subject to sanctions, which could also have a negative impact on us. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations would harm our ability to operate our business and our financial results. The risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions may be open to a variety of interpretations. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, divert management resources from the operation of our business and damage our reputation.\nWe only have regulatory approval for commercial distribution and reimbursement of lubiprostone and unoprostone isopropyl in a limited number of countries, and may not receive regulatory approval in other countries.\nWe are currently permitted to market our approved products in only a limited number of countries on a commercial basis. To obtain marketing approval in other countries, we must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, pricing, promotion and distribution of the product. Approval procedures vary among countries, and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. For example, we and Takeda are currently exploring the commercialization of AMITIZA in a number of countries. We may not be successful in obtaining such approval.\nIn addition, regulatory authorities in countries outside the U.S. and E.U. are increasingly requiring risk management plans and post-marketing commitments which may be more onerous than those required in the U.S. and E.U. The time required to obtain approval in other countries may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval or marketing authorization from the E.U. In particular, in many countries outside the U.S., including most E.U. countries and Canada, a product must receive pricing and reimbursement approval before it can be commercialized broadly. This can result in substantial delays in such countries, and the price that is ultimately approved may be lower than the price for which we expect to offer, or would be willing to offer, lubiprostone in such countries, and may impact pricing in other countries. Marketing and pricing and reimbursement approval in one country does not ensure such approvals in another. Failure to obtain the approvals necessary to commercialize lubiprostone in other countries at reimbursement levels that are acceptable to us or any delay or setback in obtaining such approvals would impair our partners\u2019 ability to develop foreign markets for lubiprostone.\nRisks Related to Our Class A Common Stock\nOur majority stockholders and their affiliates maintain the ability to have significant control over matters submitted to stockholders for approval, which could result in actions of which you or other stockholders do not approve.\nAs of March 1, 2016, our founders, Dr. Ryuji Ueno and Dr. Sachiko Kuno, together through their direct or indirect interest in S&R Technology Holding, LLC, held 21,075,255 shares of class A common stock, representing approximately 46.3% of our outstanding class A common stock. Therefore, until such time that such stockholders further dispose of additional shares of class A common stock, this concentration of ownership and voting power could influence all matters requiring stockholder approval and have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company and could prevent stockholders from receiving a premium over the market price if a change in control is proposed.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law may prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to change our management and hinder efforts to acquire a controlling interest in us, and the market price of our class A common stock may be lower as a result.\nThere are provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws that may make it difficult for a third party to acquire, or attempt to acquire, control of our company, even if a change in control was considered favorable by our stockholders. For example, our Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The Board of Directors can fix the price, rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions of the preferred stock without any further vote or action by our stockholders. The issuance of shares of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control transaction. As a result, the market price of our class A common stock and the voting and other rights of our stockholders may be adversely affected. An issuance of shares of preferred stock may result in the loss of voting control to other stockholders.\nOur charter documents contain other provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect, including:\n\u00b7 only one of our three classes of directors will be elected each year;\n\u00b7 stockholders are not entitled to remove directors other than by a 75.0% vote and for cause;\n\u00b7 stockholders are not permitted to take actions by written consent;\n\u00b7 stockholders cannot call a special meeting of stockholders; and\n\u00b7 stockholders must give advance notice to nominate directors or submit proposals for consideration at stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, we are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which regulates corporate acquisitions. These provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control transaction. They could also have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our class A common stock. These provisions may also prevent changes in our management.\nThe price of our class A common stock is volatile; investors in our class A common stock could incur substantial losses.\nThe public trading market for our class A common stock is characterized by a highly volatile stock price. The stock market in general and the market for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market and industry factors might seriously harm the market price of our class A common stock, regardless of our operating performance. As a result of this volatility, investors may not be able to sell their class A common stock at or above the price they paid, and may have difficulty selling their shares at any price. The market price for our class A common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u00b7 failure of AMITIZA (lubiprostone) or other approved products, if any, to achieve commercial success;\n\u00b7 results of clinical trials of our product candidates or those of our competitors;\n\u00b7 the regulatory status of our product candidates;\n\u00b7 the success of competitive products or technologies;\n\u00b7 regulatory developments in the U.S. and foreign countries;\n\u00b7 developments or disputes concerning patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u00b7 the ability of our third party suppliers and manufacturers to perform;\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial results;\n\u00b7 variations in the financial results of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u00b7 changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems and other regulatory developments;\n\u00b7 market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors, including those relating to the pricing of pharmaceutical products, and issuance of new or changed securities analysts\u2019 reports or recommendations; and\n\u00b7 general economic, industry and market conditions.\nWe will not be able to control many of these factors, and we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our financial results will not necessarily be indicative of our future performance.\nWe do not anticipate paying dividends on our capital stock.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain all cash we generate to fund the growth of our business and the Credit Facility restricts the payment of dividends. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on various factors, including our operating results, financial condition, future prospects and any other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. You should not rely on an investment in our company if you require dividend income from your investment in our company. The success of your investment will likely depend entirely upon any future appreciation of the market price of our capital stock, which is uncertain and unpredictable. There is no guarantee that our capital stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which you purchased your shares.\nSubstantial future sales of our class A common stock in the public market may depress our stock price and make it difficult for you to recover the full value of your investment in our class A common stock.\nAs of March 1, 2016, we had 45,539,384 shares of class A common stock outstanding. Substantially all of these shares are available for public sale, subject in some cases to volume and other limitations or delivery of a prospectus. The market price of our class A common stock may decline if our class A common stockholders sell a large number of shares of our class A common stock in the public market, or the market perceives that such sales may occur. In addition, as of March 1, 2016, we had 4,358,535 outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of 4,358,535 shares of our class A common stock. If these options are exercised and the shares issued upon exercise are sold, the market price of our securities may also decline. These factors also could impair our ability to raise needed capital by depressing the price at which we could sell our securities.\nRisks Related to Strategic Acquisitions\nOur strategy of generating growth through acquisitions may not be successful.\nOur business strategy includes growing our business through acquisition and in-licensing transactions. We may not be successful in identifying, effectively evaluating, acquiring or in-licensing, and developing and commercializing additional products on favorable terms, or at all. Competition for attractive product opportunities is intense and may require us to devote substantial resources, both managerial and financial, to an acquisition opportunity. A number of more established companies are also pursuing strategies to acquire or in-license products. These companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash resources and greater development and commercialization capabilities.\nAcquisition efforts can consume significant management attention and require substantial expenditures, which could detract from our other programs. In addition, we may devote significant resources to potential acquisitions that are never completed. Even if we are successful in acquiring a product or company, it may not result in a successfully developed or commercialized product or, even if an acquired product is commercialized, competing products or technologies could render a product noncompetitive, uneconomical or obsolete. Moreover, the cost of acquiring other companies or in-licensing products could be substantial, and in order to acquire companies or new products, we may need to incur substantial debt or issue dilutive securities. If we are unsuccessful in our efforts to acquire other companies or in-license and develop additional products, or if we acquire or in-license unproductive assets, it could have a material adverse effect on the growth of our business.\nOur failure to successfully integrate acquired assets into our operations, including our recent acquisition of R-Tech Ueno could adversely affect our ability to grow our business.\nWe may not be able to integrate any acquired business successfully, including our recent acquisition of R-Tech, or operate any acquired business profitably. In addition, cost synergies, if achieved at all, may be less than we expect, or may take greater time to achieve than we anticipate.\nIssues that could delay or prevent successful integration or cost synergies of an acquired business include, among others:\n\u00b7 retaining existing customers and attracting new customers;\n\u00b7 retaining key employees;\n\u00b7 diversion of management attention and resources;\n\u00b7 conforming internal controls, policies and procedures, business cultures and compensation programs;\n\u00b7 consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures;\n\u00b7 consolidating sales and marketing operations;\n\u00b7 identifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming operations and assets;\n\u00b7 assumption of known and unknown liabilities;\n\u00b7 coordinating geographically dispersed organizations; and\n\u00b7 managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating operations.\nIf we are unable to successfully integrate the R-Tech Ueno acquisition or future acquisitions with our existing businesses, or operate any acquired business profitably, we may not obtain the advantages that the acquisitions were intended to create, which may materially adversely affect the growth of our business.\nWe may be unable to realize the benefits we anticipate from the acquisition of R-Tech, including an improved financial position, or it may take longer than anticipated for us to achieve those benefits.\nOur realization of the benefits anticipated as a result of the acquisition of R-Tech (the Acquisition)-including an improved financial position, manufacturing and supply chain control and the expansion and diversification of our pipeline for development or outsourcing-will depend in part on the integration of R-Tech\u2019s business with ours. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to operate R-Tech\u2019s business profitably or integrate it successfully into our operations in a timely fashion, or at all. Following the Acquisition, the size of the combined company\u2019s business is significantly larger than our business prior to the Acquisition. Our future success as a combined company depends, in part, upon our ability to manage this expanded business, which will pose substantial challenges for our management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity. The dedication of management resources to this integration could detract attention from our current day-to-day business, and we cannot assure stockholders that there will not be substantial costs associated with the transition process or other negative consequences as a result of these integration efforts. These effects, including incurring unexpected costs or delays in connection with integration of the two businesses, or the failure of the combined company to perform as expected, could negatively affect our stock price or could harm our financial condition, results of operations or business prospects.\nThe loss of key personnel could hurt our business and our prospects.\nThe success of the Acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to retain key employees who continue employment with the combined company after the Acquisition is completed. If any of these key employees terminate their employment, our manufacturing, supply or development activities might be negatively affected and our management\u2019s attention might be diverted from successfully integrating R-Tech\u2019s operations. In addition, we might not be able to locate suitable replacements on reasonable terms for any such key employees who leave the combined company.\nFinancial Related Risks\nIf we fail to comply with the covenants and other obligations under our Credit Facility, the Lenders may be able to accelerate amounts owed under the facility and may foreclose upon the assets securing our obligations.\nOur Credit Facility, which we entered into in October 2015, consists of a total of $250 million in term loans and allows for the incurrence of incremental loans in an amount up to $25 million. The term loans are payable in quarterly installments starting in March 2016 through September 2021, with the balance due in a final installment in October 2021. The Credit Facility includes an annual mandatory prepayment of the term loans of 75% of excess cash flow minus specified voluntary prepayments with step downs as our leverage ratio decreases. Additionally, the Credit Facility requires mandatory prepayment of the term loans from a portion of net cash proceeds of specified asset dispositions, certain casualties and condemnations events, and certain debt. The obligations under the Credit Facility are secured, subject to customary permitted liens and other agreed upon exceptions, by a perfected security interest in (i) all of our tangible and intangible assets, except for specified customary excluded assets, and (ii) all of the capital stock we own, subject to specified exceptions.\nThe Credit Facility contains specified affirmative covenants, including the provision of annual and quarterly financial statements and compliance certificates, maintenance of property, insurance, compliance with laws and environmental matters. The Credit Facility also contains negative covenants, including restrictions on the incurrence of indebtedness, granting of liens, making investments and acquisitions, paying dividends, repurchases of equity interests, entering into affiliate transactions and asset sales. In addition, the Credit Facility contains a financial covenant that requires us to not exceed a maximum total leverage ratio. The Credit Facility also provides for a number of events of default, including failure to make a payment of principal or any premium when due, or failure to make an interest or other payment within three business days of the due date, bankruptcy or other specified insolvency event, failure to comply covenants, breach of representations or warranties, our default of specified other obligations relating to indebtedness, impairment of specified liens, a change of control of our company and judgment defaults. We are currently in compliance with all covenants under this Credit Facility. However, if we fail to comply with the covenants and our other obligations under the Credit Facility, the Lenders would be able to accelerate the required repayment of amounts due under the loan agreement and, if they are not repaid, could foreclose upon our assets securing our obligations under the Credit Facility.\nThe Credit Facility restricts the manner in which we may operate our business, which may prevent us from successfully implementing our business plan.\nThe Credit Facility contains restrictions on the operation of our business, including limits on our ability to:\n\u00b7 make specified capital expenditures;\n\u00b7 merge, consolidate or liquidate;\n\u00b7 incur indebtedness;\n\u00b7 dispose of, or grant liens on, our assets;\n\u00b7 engage in business activities other than our current business activities;\n\u00b7 amend specified agreements;\n\u00b7 enter into transactions with our affiliates;\n\u00b7 change our fiscal year or accounting policies;\n\u00b7 pay dividends or make distributions to our stockholders;\n\u00b7 prepay indebtedness; and\n\u00b7 make specified loans, guarantees or indemnities.\nComplying with these restrictions may cause us to take actions that are not favorable to our stockholders and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business plan and compete against companies who are not subject to such restrictions.\nServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our operations to pay our substantial debt.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our total consolidated indebtedness was $252.4 million. Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nOur current indebtedness and any additional debt financing may restrict the operation of our business and limit the cash available for investment in our business operations.\nIn addition to our current debt, we may seek additional debt financing to support our ongoing activities or to provide additional financial flexibility. Debt financing could have significant adverse consequences for our business, including:\n\u00b7 requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to payment on our debt, which would reduce the amounts available to fund other corporate initiatives;\n\u00b7 increasing the amount of interest that we have to pay on debt with variable interest rates, if market rates of interest increase;\n\u00b7 subjecting us to restrictive covenants that may reduce our ability to take certain corporate actions, acquire companies, products or technology, or obtain further debt financing;\n\u00b7 requiring us to pledge our assets as collateral, which could limit our ability to obtain additional debt financing;\n\u00b7 limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, general adverse economic and industry conditions; and\n\u00b7 placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt, better debt servicing options or stronger debt servicing capacity.\nWe may not have sufficient funds or be able to obtain additional financing to pay the amounts due under our indebtedness. In addition, failure to comply with the covenants under our debt instruments could result in an event of default under those instruments. An event of default could result in the acceleration of amounts due under a particular debt instrument and a cross default and acceleration under other debt instruments, and we may not have sufficient funds or be able to obtain additional financing to make any accelerated payments. Under these circumstances, our lenders could seek to enforce security interests, if any, in our assets securing our indebtedness.\nWe may require significant additional funding and may be unable to raise capital when needed or on acceptable terms, which would harm our ability to grow our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may require significant additional funding to grow our business, including to acquire other companies or products, in-license and develop additional products, enhance our manufacturing capacity, support commercial marketing activities or otherwise provide additional financial flexibility. We may also require additional funding to support our ongoing operations in the event that our ability to sell Amitiza to Takeda, Mylan and Gloria or sell RESCULA to Santen is interrupted for an extended period of time, reducing our revenues and decreasing our cash balances.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $131.0 million of cash, cash equivalents and accounts receivable. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, among others:\n\u00b7 the level, timing and cost of product sales;\n\u00b7 the extent to which we acquire or invest in companies, products or technologies;\n\u00b7 the payment obligations under our indebtedness;\n\u00b7 the scope, progress, results and costs of our development activities;\n\u00b7 our ability to obtain funding from collaborative partners, government entities and non-governmental organizations for our development programs; and\n\u00b7 the costs of commercialization activities, including product marketing, sales and distribution.\nIf our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements, we will need to finance our cash needs through public or private equity or debt offerings, bank loans or collaboration and licensing arrangements. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience dilution. Public or bank debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants, like those contained in our term loans, limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, pursuing acquisition opportunities or declaring dividends. If we raise funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties, it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.\nCurrent economic conditions may make it difficult to obtain financing on attractive terms, or at all. If financing is unavailable or lost, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected and we could be forced to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate many of our planned activities.", "PERMNO": 92226, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "SCMP"}
