RISK FACTORS\nFactors That May Affect Financial Condition and Future Results\nThe current downturn and past downturns in the oil and gas industry have had a negative effect on the Company\u2019s sales, the Company's customers' ability to pay and the Company's profitability.\nDemand for most of the Company\u2019s products and services, and therefore its revenue, depends to a large extent upon the level of capital expenditures related to oil and gas exploration, development, production, processing and transmission. Declines, as well as anticipated declines, in oil and gas prices could negatively affect the level of these activities, and could result in the cancellation, modification or rescheduling of existing orders and the ability of our customers to pay. For example, oil prices began declining during the third quarter of 2014 and continued to decline through early 2016. Average daily prices for West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude during 2015 were each down more than 42% from 2014. Similarly, natural gas prices declined from an average of $4.35 per MMBtu during 2014 to $2.61 per MMBtu for 2015. These declines in commodity prices began to impact the average number of working rigs which began declining in late 2014 and continued to decline during 2015. Globally, the average rig count for 2015 was down 35% from 2014, with even steeper declines occurring in the United States and Canada. These market conditions negatively affected 2015 results and are expected to continue to significantly affect future results as exploration and production activity levels and, therefore, demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, as well as our customers' ability to pay continue to decline. During 2015, numerous deepwater projects were deferred and deepwater rigs idled. Efforts are also being made by drilling contractors to defer deliveries of new deepwater rigs currently under construction. In addition to a decline in future orders and revenues, the Company expects to incur additional costs as it continues to adjust, as necessary, its commercial, manufacturing and support operations levels to meet expected future customer demand. See also the discussion in \u201cMarket Conditions\u201d above for 2015 as compared to 2014.\nCancellation, downsizing or delays of orders in backlog are possible.\nAs described above, commodity prices have declined significantly since mid-2014 which has resulted in various oil and gas exploration and production companies implementing spending cuts or deferrals in their 2015 capital spending plans, as well as headcount reductions, with continued cuts and deferrals expected for 2016. At current price levels, certain projects, particularly those in deepwater environments and unconventional resource regions, may become uneconomical for the risk involved. Certain customers that are more highly leveraged may also experience concerns regarding future projected cash flows based on current price levels. These factors could result in existing orders in backlog being cancelled, downsized or future shipment dates may be delayed, all of which could further negatively impact the Company\u2019s future profitability.\nCameron will be subject to business uncertainties and certain operating restrictions until completion of the merger with Schlumberger.\nIn connection with the pending merger with Schlumberger, some of the suppliers and customers of Cameron may delay or defer sales and purchasing decisions, which could negatively impact revenues, earnings and cash flows regardless of whether the merger is completed. Additionally, Cameron has agreed in the merger agreement to refrain from taking certain actions with respect to our business and financial affairs during the pendency of the merger, which restrictions could be in place for an extended period of time if completion of the merger is delayed and could adversely impact Cameron\u2019s ability to execute certain of our business strategies and their financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nCameron may be unable to attract and retain key employees during the pendency of the merger.\nIn connection with the pending merger with Schlumberger, current and prospective employees of Cameron may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company following the merger, which may materially adversely affect the ability of Cameron to attract and retain key personnel while the merger is pending. Key employees may depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the combined company following the merger. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that Cameron will be able to attract and retain key employees to the same extent that Cameron has been able to in the past.\nFailure to complete the merger with Schlumberger could negatively impact Cameron.\nIf the pending merger with Schlumberger is not completed, Cameron's ongoing businesses and the market price of its common stock may be adversely affected and Cameron will be subject to several risks; including Cameron being required, under certain circumstances, to pay a termination fee of $321 million to Schlumberger; Cameron having to pay certain costs relating to the merger; and diverting the focus of Cameron management from pursuing other opportunities that could be beneficial to Cameron; in each case, without realizing any of the benefits that might have resulted if the pending merger had been completed.\nPortions of the backlog for our Subsea and Drilling segments are subject to heightened execution risk.\nCameron is involved in projects to provide customers with deepwater stacks and complete drilling packages for jackup rigs and, through our Subsea segment, is a significant participant in the subsea systems projects market. Some of the projects for these markets carry heightened execution risk because of their scope and complexity, in terms of both technical and logistical requirements. Such projects (i) may often involve long lead times, (ii) are larger in financial scope, (iii) require substantial engineering resources to meet the technical requirements of the project and (iv) often involve the application of existing technology to new environments and, in some cases, may require the development of new technology. As a subset of its total backlog at December 31, 2015, the Company had projects fitting this risk profile that amounted to approximately $914 million in its Drilling segment and approximately $1.8 billion in its Subsea segment. To the extent the Company experiences unplanned difficulties in meeting the technical and/or delivery requirements of the projects, the Company\u2019s earnings or liquidity could be negatively impacted. The Company accounts for its drilling and subsea projects, as it does its separation projects, using accounting rules for construction-type and production-type contracts. Factors that may affect future project costs and margins include the ability to properly execute the engineering and design phases consistent with our customers\u2019 expectations, production efficiencies obtained, and the availability and costs of labor, materials and subcomponents. These factors can impact the accuracy of the Company\u2019s estimates and materially impact the Company\u2019s future period earnings. If the Company experiences cost overruns, the expected margin could decline. If this were to occur, in accordance with the accounting guidance, the Company would record a cumulative adjustment to reduce the margin previously recorded on the related project in the period a change in the estimate is needed. Deepwater stack and jackup complete drilling packages, and subsea systems projects, accounted for approximately 8% and 14%, respectively, of total revenues for 2015.\nAs a designer, manufacturer, installer and servicer of oil and gas pressure control equipment, the Company may be subject to liability, personal injury, property damage and environmental contamination should such equipment fail to perform to specifications.\nCameron provides products and systems to customers involved in oil and gas exploration, development and production, as well as in certain other industrial markets. Some of the Company\u2019s equipment is designed to operate in high-temperature and/or high-pressure environments on land, on offshore platforms and on the seabed, and some equipment is designed for use in hydraulic fracturing operations. Cameron also provides parts and repair services at numerous facilities located around the world, as well as at customer sites for this type of equipment. Because of applications to which the Company\u2019s products and services are put, particularly those involving the high temperature and/or pressure environments, a failure of such equipment, or a failure of our customer to maintain or operate the equipment properly, could cause damage to the equipment, damage to the property of customers and others, personal injury and environmental contamination, onshore or offshore, leading to claims against Cameron.\nCertain of the Company\u2019s risk mitigation strategies may not be fully effective.\nThe Company relies on customer indemnifications and third-party insurance as part of its risk mitigation strategy. There is, however, an increasing reluctance of customers to provide what had been typical oilfield indemnifications for pollution, consequential losses, property damage, and personal injury and death, and a reluctance, even refusal, of counterparties to honor their contractual indemnity obligations when given. In addition, insurance companies may refuse to honor their policies.\nAn example of both is the Company\u2019s experience in the Deepwater Horizon matter. The Company\u2019s customer denied that it owed any indemnification under its contract with us, and when called on to participate in the Company\u2019s settlement with BP Exploration and Production Inc., one of the seven insurers refused to provide coverage. The Company subsequently sued its insurer and won a judgment for the full policy amount plus interest and costs, but the insurer continues to litigate the matter.\nThe implementation of an upgraded business information system may disrupt the Company\u2019s operations or its system of internal controls.\nThe Company has a project underway to upgrade its SAP business information systems worldwide. The first stage of this multi-year effort was completed at the beginning of the third quarter of 2011 with the deployment of the upgraded system to the Company\u2019s process systems and compression businesses. Since then, other businesses and business functions have been migrated in stages. As of December 31, 2015, nearly all businesses within the V&M segment, the Surface segment, the Drilling segment, the Company\u2019s worldwide engineering and human resource functions, as well as other corporate office activities are now operating on the upgraded system. The OneSubsea business is scheduled to begin using the upgraded system in 2016. The Drilling segment and the OneSubsea business are major contributors to the Company\u2019s consolidated revenues and income before income taxes.\nAs this system continues to be deployed throughout the Company, delays or difficulties may be encountered in effectively and efficiently processing transactions and conducting business operations, including project management, until such time as personnel are familiar with all appropriate aspects and capabilities of the upgraded systems.\nThe Company\u2019s operations and information systems are subject to cybersecurity risks.\nCameron continues to increase its dependence on digital technologies to conduct its operations. Many of the Company\u2019s files are digitized and more employees are working in almost paperless environments. Additionally, the hardware, network and software environments to operate SAP, the Company\u2019s main enterprise-wide operating system, have been outsourced to third parties. Other key software products used by the Company to conduct its operations either reside on servers in remote locations or are operated by the software vendors or other third parties for the Company\u2019s use as \u201ccloud-based\u201d or \u201cweb-based\u201d applications. The Company has also outsourced certain information technology development, maintenance and support functions. As a result, the Company is exposed to potentially severe cyber incidents at both its internal locations and outside vendor locations that could result in a theft of intellectual property and/or disruption of its operations for an extended period of time resulting in the loss of critical data and in higher costs to correct and remedy the effects of such incidents.\nFluctuations in currency markets can impact the Company\u2019s profitability.\nThe Company has established multiple \u201cCenters of Excellence\u201d facilities for manufacturing such products as subsea trees, subsea chokes, subsea production controls and blowout preventers. These production facilities are located in the United Kingdom, Brazil, Romania, Italy, Norway and other European and Asian countries. To the extent the Company sells these products in U.S. dollars, the Company\u2019s profitability is eroded when the U.S. dollar weakens against the British pound, the euro, the Brazilian real and certain Asian currencies, including the Singapore dollar. Alternatively, profitability is enhanced when the U.S. dollar strengthens against these same currencies. For further information on the use of derivatives to mitigate certain currency exposures, see Part II, Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\u201d below and Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements.\nThe Company\u2019s operations expose it to risks of non-compliance with numerous countries\u2019 import and export laws and regulations, and with various nations\u2019 trade laws and regulations including U.S. sanctions.\nThe Company\u2019s operations expose it to anti-boycott, economic sanctions, export, import, and other trade regulations in multiple jurisdictions. In addition to using \u201cCenters of Excellence\u201d for manufacturing products to be delivered around the world, the Company imports raw materials, semi-finished goods and finished products into many countries for use in country or for manufacturing and/or finishing for re-export and import into another country for use or further integration into equipment or systems. This movement of raw materials, semi-finished or finished products involves exports and imports that can be subject to regulation by multiple jurisdiction. In addition, the Company conducts business, organizes and owns legal entities and engages employees, vendors and customers in and from various countries, and these activities and parties are subject to various, and sometimes divergent, economic sanctions, anti-boycott and other trade regulations. The Company has undergone and will likely continue to undergo governmental audits to determine compliance with export and customs laws and regulations. As a result, compliance with multiple trade sanctions and embargoes and import and export laws and regulations poses a constant challenge and risk to the Company.\nFrom time to time, the Company has received inquiries from U.S. governmental agencies, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") and the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, regarding compliance with certain of these laws and regulations. Currently, the Company is responding to an inquiry from the Department of Justice regarding the compliance with U.S. economic sanctions against Iran. See the discussion in Part II, Item 9B.\nThe Company\u2019s operations require it to deal with a variety of cultures and countries, as well as agents and other intermediaries, exposing it to anti-corruption compliance risks.\nDoing business on a worldwide basis necessarily involves exposing the Company and its operations to risks inherent in complying with the laws and regulations of a number of different nations. These laws and regulations include various anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws. Investigations of non-compliance, even when no wrongdoing is found, as well as penalties and other costs associated with violations of these laws could have an adverse impact on the Company's financial statements and results.\nIn addition to bribery and corruption risks which exist around the world, the Company does business and has operations in a number of countries that are generally perceived as presenting a higher than normal risk of corruption. Maintaining and administering an effective anti-bribery compliance program under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the United Kingdom\u2019s Bribery Act of 2010, and similar statutes of other nations in these environments present greater challenges to the Company than is the case in other countries. Additionally, the Company\u2019s business involves the use of agents and other intermediaries, such as customs brokers. As a result, the risk to the Company of compliance violations is increased because\nactions taken by any of them when attempting to conduct business on our behalf could be imputed to us by law enforcement authorities.\nFrom time to time, the Company has received inquiries from U.S. government agencies, including the SEC and the U.S. Department of Justice regarding compliance with certain of these laws and regulations. The Company is currently responding to an inquiry from the SEC and Department of Justice regarding anti-bribery matters. See the discussion in Part II, Item 9B.\nAdditionally, these risks can negatively effect our customers and, therefore, the Company itself. As an example, various employees and former employees of the Company\u2019s primary customer in Brazil are being investigated currently over allegations of bribery and other acts of corruption. This investigation, along with the current recessionary economic conditions in Brazil, is, at present, having a negative impact on future orders and growth prospects for the Company\u2019s operations in Brazil. Sales to customers in Brazil accounted for approximately 4% of the Company\u2019s consolidated revenues during 2015 and 6% in 2014.\nOur Compliance Programs May Not Prevent Violations of Applicable Laws and Regulations\nWe have an ethics and compliance program that is designed to deter or detect violations of applicable laws and regulations through the application of our policies and procedures, Code of Conduct, Ethics Helpline, training, internal controls, investigation and remediation activities, and other activities. However, our ethics and compliance program may not be fully effective in preventing all employees, contractors or intermediaries from violating or circumventing our compliance requirements or applicable laws and regulations. Violations of applicable laws and regulations can result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, administrative remedies, and restrictions on our business conduct, and could have an adverse effect on our reputation and our business, our operating results, and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s operations expose it to political and economic risks and instability due to changes in economic conditions, civil unrest, foreign currency fluctuations, and other risks, such as local content requirements, inherent to international businesses.\nThe political and economic risks of doing business on a worldwide basis include the following:\n\u2022\nvolatility in general economic, social and political conditions;\n\u2022\nthe effects of civil unrest and, in some cases, military action on the Company\u2019s business operations, customers and employees, such as that recently occurring in several countries in the Middle East and in Venezuela;\n\u2022\nexchange controls or other similar measures which result in restrictions on repatriation of capital and/or income, such as those involving the currencies of, and the Company\u2019s operations in, Angola and Nigeria; and\n\u2022\nreductions in the number or capacity of qualified personnel.\nCameron also has manufacturing and service operations that are essential parts of its business in other developing countries and volatile areas in Africa, Latin America and other countries that were part of the Former Soviet Union, the Middle East, and Central and South East Asia. Operating in certain of these regions has increased the Company\u2019s risk of identifying and hiring sufficient numbers of qualified personnel to meet customer demand in selected locations. The Company also purchases a large portion of its raw materials and components from a relatively small number of foreign suppliers in China, India and other developing countries. The ability of these suppliers to meet the Company\u2019s demand could be adversely affected by the factors described above.\nIn addition, customers in countries such as Angola and Nigeria increasingly are requiring the Company to accept payments in the local currencies of these countries. These currencies do not currently trade actively in the world\u2019s foreign exchange markets. The government of Angola devalued its currency during 2015, resulting in a loss of $9 million being recorded by the Company on its kwanza-denominated net assets. Angola further devalued its currency an additional 15%, effective January 1, 2016.\nIncreasingly, some of the Company\u2019s customers, particularly the national oil companies, have required a certain percentage, or an increased percentage, of local content in the products they buy directly or indirectly from the Company. This requires the Company to add to or expand manufacturing capabilities in certain countries that are presently without the necessary infrastructure or human resources in place to conduct business in a manner as typically done by Cameron. This increases the risk of untimely deliveries, cost overruns and defective products.\nThe Company\u2019s operations expose it to risks resulting from differing and/or increasing tax rates.\nEconomic conditions around the world have resulted in decreased tax revenues for many governments, which have led and could continue to lead to changes in tax laws in countries where the Company does business, including further changes in the United States. Changes in tax laws could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s future results.\nThe Company is subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that expose the Company to potential liability and proposed new regulations that would restrict activities to which the Company currently provides equipment and services.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to a variety of national and state, provincial and local laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. The Company is required to invest financial and managerial resources to comply with these laws and expects to continue to do so in the future. To date, the cost of complying with governmental regulation has not been material, but the fact that such laws or regulations are frequently changed makes it impossible for the Company to predict the cost or impact of such laws and regulations on the Company\u2019s future operations. The modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations imposing more stringent environmental restrictions could adversely affect the Company.\nThe Company provides equipment and services to companies employing hydraulic fracturing or \u201cfracking\u201d and could be adversely impacted by additional regulations of this enhanced recovery technique.\nEnvironmental concerns have been raised regarding the potential impact on underground water supplies of hydraulic fracturing which involves the pumping of water and certain chemicals under pressure into a well to break apart shale and other rock formations in order to increase the flow of oil and gas embedded in these formations. On March 20, 2015, the U.S. Interior Department\u2019s Bureau of Land Management (BLM) released a final rule regulating hydraulic fracturing activities on Federal and Indian lands. The final rule includes new well-bore integrity requirements, imposes standards for interim storage of recovered waste fluids, and requires notifications and waiting periods for key parts of the fracturing process, which could lead to delays in fracturing and/or drilling operations. The rule also mandates disclosure of the chemicals used in the process. Additionally, on April 7, 2015, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a proposed rule that would prohibit the disposal of unconventional oil and natural gas wastewater at publicly owned treatment works.\nA number of U.S. states have also proposed regulations regarding disclosure of chemicals used in fracking operations or have temporarily suspended issuance of permits for such operations. The State of New York implemented a statewide ban on hydraulic fracturing at the beginning of 2015 which limits natural gas production from a portion of the Marcellus Shale region. Additionally, the United States EPA issued rules, which became effective in January 2015, designed to limit the release of volatile organic compounds, or pollutants, from natural gas wells that are hydraulically fractured.\nShould these regulations, or additional regulations and bans by governments, continue to restrict or further curtail hydraulic fracturing activities, the Company\u2019s revenues and earnings could be negatively impacted.\nEnacted and proposed climate protection regulations and legislation may impact the Company\u2019s operations or those of its customers.\nThe EPA has made a finding under the United States Clean Air Act that greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health and welfare and enacted regulations requiring monitoring and reporting by certain facilities and companies of greenhouse gas emissions. In June 2014, the EPA, acting under President Obama\u2019s Climate Action Plan, proposed its Clean Power Plan, which would set U.S. state-by-state guidelines for power plants to meet by 2030 to cut their carbon emissions by 30% nationwide from 2005 levels. The guidelines are also intended to cut pollution, nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide by more than 25% during the same period. Under the Clean Power Plan, States are to develop plans to meet state-specific goals to reduce carbon pollution and submit those plans to the EPA by June 2016, with a later deadline provided under certain circumstances. While these proposed rules may hasten the switch from coal to cleaner burning fuels such as natural gas, the overall long-term economic impact of the Plan is uncertain at this point.\nCarbon emission reporting and reduction programs have also expanded in recent years at the state, regional and national levels with certain countries having already implemented various types of cap-and-trade programs aimed at reducing carbon emissions from companies that currently emit greenhouse gases.\nTo the extent the Company\u2019s customers are subject to these or other similar proposed or newly enacted laws and regulations, the Company is exposed to risks that the additional costs by customers to comply with such laws and regulations could impact their ability or desire to continue to operate at current or anticipated levels in certain jurisdictions, which could negatively impact their demand for the Company\u2019s products and services.\nTo the extent Cameron becomes subject to any of these or other similar proposed or newly enacted laws and regulations, the Company expects that its efforts to monitor, report and comply with such laws and regulations, and any related taxes imposed on companies by such programs, will increase the Company\u2019s cost of doing business in certain jurisdictions, including the United States, and may require expenditures on a number of its facilities and possibly on modifications of certain of its products.\nThe Company could also be impacted by new laws and regulations establishing cap-and-trade and by those that might favor the increased use of non-fossil fuels, including nuclear, wind, solar and bio-fuels or that are designed to increase energy efficiency. If the proposed or newly executed laws have the effect of dampening demand for oil and gas production, they could lower spending by customers for the Company\u2019s products and services.\nEnvironmental Remediation\nThe Company\u2019s worldwide operations are subject to domestic and international regulations with regard to air, soil, waste management, and water quality as well as other environmental matters such as resource conservation. The Company, through its Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) Management System and corporate third-party regulatory compliance audit program, believes it is in substantial compliance with these regulations.\nThe Company is heir to a number of older manufacturing plants that conducted operations in accordance with the standards of the time, but which have since changed. The Company has undertaken clean-up efforts at these sites and now conducts its business in accordance with current standards and/or regulatory requirements. The Company\u2019s clean-up efforts have yielded limited releases of liability from regulators in some instances, and have allowed sites with no current operations to be sold. The Company conducts environmental due diligence prior to all new site acquisitions. For further information, refer to Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements.\nEnvironmental Sustainability\nThe Company has pursued environmental sustainability in a number of ways. Processes are monitored in an attempt to minimize waste produced and conserve natural resources where possible. All of the waste disposal firms used by the Company are carefully selected in an attempt to prevent any future Superfund involvements. Actions are taken in an attempt to minimize the generation of hazardous wastes and to minimize air emissions. Recycling of process wastewater is a common practice. Best management practices related to spill prevention and storm water pollution prevention are used in an effort to prevent contamination of soil and ground water on the Company\u2019s sites and neighboring facilities.\nCameron has implemented a corporate HSE Management System that incorporates many of the principles of ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001. The HSE Management System contains a set of corporate standards that are required to be implemented and verified by each business unit. Cameron also has a corporate regulatory compliance audit program which uses independent third-party auditors to audit facilities on a regular basis to verify facility compliance with the relevant country, region and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Audit reports are circulated to the senior management of the Company and to the appropriate business unit. The compliance program requires corrective and preventative actions be taken by a facility to remedy all findings of non-compliance which are tracked on the corporate HSE data base and monitored by corporate HSE staff.\nThe Company's 2014 Sustainability Report, issued in June 2015, is available on our website at www.c-a-m.com/company.", "PERMNO": 81857, "SIC": 3533, "TIC": "CAM"}
