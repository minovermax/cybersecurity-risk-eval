{"cik": "40729", "company": "Ally Financial Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe face many risks and uncertainties, any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition (including capital and liquidity), or prospects or the value of or return on an investment in Ally. We believe that the most significant of these risks and uncertainties are described in this section, although we may be adversely affected by other risks or uncertainties that are not presently known to us, that we have failed to appreciate, or that we currently consider immaterial. These risk factors should be read in conjunction with Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This Annual Report on Form 10-K is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nRisks Related to Regulation\nThe regulatory and supervisory environment in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nWe are subject to extensive regulatory frameworks and to direct supervision and periodic examinations by various government agencies that are charged with overseeing the kinds of business activities in which we engage. These regulatory and supervisory frameworks are designed to protect public or private interests-such as macroeconomic policy objectives, financial-market stability and liquidity, and the confidence and security of depositors-that may not always be aligned with those of our shareholders or non-deposit creditors. Refer to the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report. In the last decade, moreover, government scrutiny of the financial services industry has intensified, fundamental changes have been made to the banking, securities, and other laws that govern financial services, and a multitude of related business practices have been altered. As a result, we expect to continue devoting substantial time and resources to risk management, compliance, regulatory-change management, and cybersecurity and other technology initiatives, each of which may adversely affect our ability to operate profitably or to pursue advantageous business opportunities.\nAlly currently operates as an FHC, which permits us to engage in a number of financial activities-including securities, insurance, and merchant-banking activities-beyond the business of banking. To maintain our status as an FHC, Ally Bank must remain \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d and \u201cwell-managed\u201d as defined under applicable law. If we fail to maintain our status as an FHC, we may be restricted from engaging in the broader range of financial activities permitted for FHCs and may be required to discontinue these activities or even divest Ally Bank. In addition, if we fail to achieve specified ratings under the Community Reinvestment Act, our ability to expand these financial activities could be restricted.\nIn connection with their continuous supervision and examinations, the FRB, the UDFI, the CFPB, the SEC, FINRA, or other regulatory agencies may require changes in our business or operations. Such a requirement may be judicially enforceable or impractical for us to contest, and if we are unable to implement or maintain the requirement in a timely and effective manner, we could become subject to formal or informal supervisory actions, including memoranda of understanding, written agreements, cease-and-desist orders, and prompt-corrective-action or safety-and-soundness directives. Supervisory actions could entail significant restrictions on our existing business, our ability to develop new business, our flexibility in conducting operations, and our ability to pay dividends or utilize capital. Supervisory actions also may result in the imposition of civil monetary penalties, the enforcement of supervisory requirements through injunctions or other administrative or judicial orders, related litigation by private plaintiffs, damage to our reputation, and a loss of investor confidence. We could be required as well to dispose of specified assets and liabilities within a prescribed period. As a result, any supervisory action could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nOur regulatory environment is not static. No assurance can be given that applicable statutes, regulations, or other laws will not be amended or construed differently, that new laws will not be adopted, or that any of these laws will not be enforced more aggressively. Changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, including by limiting the types of financial services and products we may offer, increasing the ability of others to offer more competitive financial services and products, restricting our ability to make acquisitions or pursue other profitable opportunities, and negatively impacting our franchise and results of operations. Further, noncompliance with applicable laws could result in the suspension or revocation of licenses or registrations that we need to operate and in the initiation of supervisory actions or private litigation.\nOur ability to execute our business strategy for Ally Bank may be adversely affected by regulatory constraints.\nA primary component of our business strategy is the growth of Ally Bank. This planned growth includes shifting more of our automotive lending from Ally to Ally Bank, amassing a higher level of retail deposits, expanding our commercial lending, and introducing additional consumer products such as residential mortgage loans and credit cards. If our banking supervisors raise concerns about any aspect of our business strategy for Ally Bank or the way in which we implement it-including any associated affiliate transactions that are governed and constrained by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act-we may be obliged to limit or even reverse the growth of Ally Bank or otherwise alter our strategy, which could have an adverse effect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects. We also may be adversely affected if our regulatory normalization of Ally Bank does not advance as expected, including a near-term release or reduction of the individual minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio for Ally Bank that had been set at 15% in connection with the acceptance of our membership in the Federal Reserve System. Refer to the section titled Liquidity Management, Funding, and Regulatory Capital in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, if we are compelled to retain or shift any of our business activities in or to nonbank affiliates, our funding costs for those activities-such as unsecured funding in the capital markets-could be more expensive than our cost of funds at Ally Bank.\nWe are subject to stress tests, capital and liquidity planning, and other enhanced prudential standards, which impose significant restrictions and costly requirements on our business and operations.\nWe are subject to the enhanced prudential standards that have been established by the FRB for BHCs with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, including capital planning requirements for large and noncomplex BHCs with total consolidated assets between $50 billion and $250 billion and total nonbank assets of less than $75 billion. As part of these enhanced prudential standards, Ally is subject to supervisory and company-run stress tests and must submit a proposed capital plan to the FRB annually. Refer to the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report. The proposed capital plan must include an assessment of our expected uses and sources of capital and a description of all planned capital actions over a nine-quarter planning horizon, including any issuance of a debt or\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nequity capital instrument, any dividend or other capital distribution, and any similar action that the FRB determines could have an impact on Ally\u2019s capital. The proposed capital plan must also include a discussion of how Ally, under expected and stressful conditions, will maintain capital commensurate with its risks and above the minimum regulatory capital ratios and serve as a source of strength to Ally Bank. The FRB will either object to the proposed capital plan, in whole or in part, or provide notice of non-objection to Ally. The failure to receive a notice of non-objection from the FRB may prohibit us from paying dividends, repurchasing our common stock, or making other capital distributions, may compel us to issue capital instruments that could be dilutive to shareholders, may prevent us from maintaining or expanding lending or other business activities, and may damage our reputation and result in a loss of investor confidence.\nWe may be required to raise capital as well if we fail to satisfy our minimum capital ratios or other applicable supervisory requirements, whether due to inadequate operating results that erode capital, future growth that outpaces the accumulation of capital through earnings, changes in regulatory capital standards, or otherwise. In addition, we may elect to raise capital for strategic reasons even when not required to do so. Our ability to raise capital on favorable terms or at all will depend on general economic and market conditions, which are outside of our control, and on our operating and financial performance. Accordingly, we cannot be assured of being able to raise capital when needed or on favorable terms. An inability to raise capital when needed and on favorable terms could damage the performance and value of our business, prompt supervisory actions, and harm our reputation, and if the condition were to persist for any appreciable period of time, our viability as a going concern could be threatened. Further, if we are able to raise capital and do so by issuing common stock or convertible securities, the ownership interest of our existing shareholders could be diluted, and the market price of our common stock could decline.\nThe enhanced prudential standards also require Ally to conduct liquidity stress tests and maintain a sufficient quantity of highly liquid assets to survive a projected 30-day liquidity stress event, to adopt a contingency funding plan that would address liquidity needs during various stress events, and to implement specified liquidity risk management and corporate governance measures, including requirements, duties, and qualifications for Ally\u2019s risk committee and chief risk officer. These enhanced liquidity standards, together with a quantitative minimum liquidity coverage ratio that we must satisfy as a complement to these standards, could constrain our ability to originate or invest in longer-term or less liquid assets or to take advantage of other profitable opportunities and, therefore, may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and prospects.\nAdditionally, the FRB has proposed rules to implement other enhanced prudential standards mandated by Sections 165 and 166 of the Dodd-Frank Act and related capital and liquidity requirements, including single-counterparty credit limits, an early remediation framework, and a quantitative minimum net stable funding ratio. Once adopted and implemented, these rules also could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nOur ability to rely on deposits as a part of our funding strategy may be limited.\nAlly Bank is a key part of our funding strategy, and we place great reliance on deposits at Ally Bank as a source of funding. Competition for deposits and deposit customers, however, is fierce and has only intensified with the implementation of enhanced capital and liquidity requirements in the last decade. Ally Bank does not have a retail branch network but, instead, obtains its deposits through online and other direct banking as well as through deposit brokers. Brokered deposits may be more price sensitive than other types of deposits and may become less available if alternative investments offer higher returns. Brokered deposits totaled $12.2 billion at December 31, 2016, which represented 15% of Ally Bank\u2019s total deposits. In addition, our ability to maintain or grow direct banking deposits may be constrained by our lack of in-person banking services, changes in consumer trends, or any loss of confidence in our brand or franchise. Our level of deposits also could be adversely affected by regulatory or supervisory restrictions, including any applicable prior approval requirements or limits on our offered rates or brokered deposit growth. Perceptions of our financial strength, rates or returns offered by other financial institutions or third parties, and other competitive factors beyond our control, including returns on alternative investments, will also impact the size of our deposit base.\nThe full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act and other financial-reform laws and policies on us remains unclear and unpredictable but could have a further adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, which became law in July 2010, and other financial-reform laws and policies have substantially changed the legal and supervisory frameworks under which we operate and have adversely affected our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Refer to the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report. While much in the Dodd-Frank Act has been implemented, some meaningful provisions remain subject to further rulemaking, transition periods, and the discretion of various regulatory agencies. Even provisions that have been implemented are or may become the subject of interpretive disputes, litigation, or proposed legislative amendments. For example, the CFPB-which was created by the Dodd-Frank Act-has aggressively enforced its positions on a wide range of consumer protection laws that affect our business, including in the context of indirect automotive lending. Some of these positions or their application in particular cases, however, have been contested by affected companies, as has the constitutionality of the structure of the CFPB itself. The outcomes of these matters and their impact on both the meaning of consumer protection laws and the enforcement posture of the CFPB remain unclear and unpredictable but could adversely affect us. Similarly, the full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act and financial-reform laws and policies as whole on us cannot be predicted with any certainty and may not be known for a number of years, but individually or collectively, they may have a further adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects. In addition, these laws and policies may impact us differently than other financial institutions due to a number of factors, such as differences in activities, size, risk profile, complexity, or regulatory or supervisory status.\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nRequirements under the U.S. Basel III rules to increase the quality and quantity of regulatory capital and future revisions to the Basel III framework may adversely affect our business and financial results.\nIn December 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision reached an agreement on the global Basel III capital framework, which was designed to increase the quality and quantity of regulatory capital by introducing new risk-based and leverage capital standards. In July 2013, the U.S. banking agencies finalized rules implementing the Basel III capital framework in the United States as well as related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The U.S. Basel III rules represent substantial revisions to the previously effective regulatory capital standards for U.S. banking organizations.\nAlly and Ally Bank became subject to the U.S. Basel III rules on January 1, 2015, although a number of them-including new capital buffers and regulatory capital deductions-are being phased in over several years. The U.S. Basel III rules subject Ally and Ally Bank to higher minimum risk-based capital ratios and a capital conservation buffer above these minimum ratios. Failure to maintain the full amount of the buffer would result in restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions, including dividend payments and stock repurchases and redemptions, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers. The U.S. Basel III rules also will, over time, impose more stringent deductions for specified DTAs and other assets and limit our ability to meet its regulatory capital requirements through the use of trust preferred securities or other hybrid securities.\nIf Ally or Ally Bank were to fail to satisfy its regulatory capital requirements, significant regulatory sanctions could result, such as a bar on acquisitions or new activities, a loss of our status as an FHC, informal or formal supervisory actions, or even resolution or receivership. Any of these sanctions could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects.\nThe Basel Committee, moreover, continues to consider revisions to the global Basel III capital framework, many of which would heighten regulatory capital standards even more. No assurance can be provided that these revisions-if adopted in the United States-would not further impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects in an adverse way.\nOur business and financial results could be adversely affected by the political environment and governmental fiscal and monetary policies.\nA fractious or volatile political environment in the United States, including any related social unrest, could negatively impact business and market conditions, economic growth, financial stability, and business, consumer, investor, and regulatory sentiments, any one or more of which in turn could cause our business and financial results to suffer. In addition, disruptions in the foreign relations of the United States could adversely affect the automotive and other industries on which our business depends and our tax positions and other dealings in foreign countries.\nOur business and financial results are also significantly affected by the fiscal and monetary policies of the U.S. government and its agencies. We are particularly affected by the policies of the FRB, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States in pursuit of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The FRB and its policies influence the availability and demand for loans and deposits, the rates and other terms for loans and deposits, the conditions in equity, fixed-income, currency, and other markets, and the value of securities and other financial instruments. These actions and policies, therefore, could adversely affect every facet of our business and operations-for example, the new and used vehicle financing market, the cost of our deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities, and the yield on our earning assets. Tax and other fiscal policies, moreover, impact not only general economic conditions but also give rise to incentives or disincentives that affect how we and our customers prioritize objectives, deploy resources, and run households or operate businesses. Both the timing and the nature of any changes in monetary or fiscal policies are beyond our control and difficult to predict and could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nIf our ability to receive distributions from subsidiaries is restricted, we may not be able to satisfy our obligations to counterparties or creditors, make dividend payments to shareholders, or repurchase our common stock.\nAlly is a legal entity separate and distinct from its bank and nonbank subsidiaries and, in part, depends on dividend payments and other distributions from those subsidiaries to fund its obligations to counterparties and creditors, its dividend payments to shareholders, and its repurchases of common stock. Refer to the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Regulatory or other legal restrictions, deterioration in a subsidiary\u2019s performance, or investments in a subsidiary\u2019s own growth may limit the ability of the subsidiary to transfer funds freely to Ally. In particular, many of Ally\u2019s subsidiaries are subject to laws that authorize their supervisory agencies to block or reduce the flow of funds to Ally. In addition, if any subsidiary were unable to remain viable as a going concern, Ally\u2019s right to participate in a distribution of assets would be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary\u2019s creditors (including, in the case of Ally Bank, its depositors and the FDIC).\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWeak or deteriorating economic conditions, failures in underwriting, changes in underwriting standards, financial or systemic shocks, or growth in our nonprime financing business could increase our credit risk, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nOur business is centered around lending and banking, and a significant percentage of our assets are composed of loans, leases, and securities. As a result, credit risk is among our most pronounced risks.\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nOur business and financial results depend significantly on household, business, economic, and market conditions. When those conditions are weak or deteriorating, we could simultaneously experience reduced demand for credit and increased delinquencies or defaults, including in the loans that we have securitized and in which we retain a residual interest. These kinds of conditions also could dampen the demand for products and services in our insurance, banking, brokerage, and other businesses. Increased delinquencies or defaults could result as well from us failing to appropriately underwrite loans that we originate or purchase or from us adopting-for strategic, competitive, or other reasons-more liberal underwriting standards. If delinquencies or defaults on our loans increase, their value and the income derived from them could be adversely affected, and we could incur increased administrative and other costs in seeking a recovery on claims and any collateral. If unfavorable conditions are negatively affecting used vehicle or other collateral values at the same time, the amount and timing of recoveries could suffer as well. Weak or deteriorating economic conditions also may negatively impact the market value and liquidity of our investment securities, and we may be required to record additional impairment charges that negatively impact earnings if investment securities suffer a decline in value that is considered other-than-temporary. There can be no assurance that our monitoring of our credit risk and our efforts to mitigate credit risk through risk-based pricing, appropriate underwriting and investment policies, loss-mitigation strategies, and diversification are, or will be, sufficient to prevent an adverse impact to our business and financial results. A financial or systemic shock and a failure of a significant counterparty or a significant group of counterparties could negatively impact us as well, possibly to a severe degree, due to our role as a financial intermediary and the interconnectedness of the financial system.\nOur exposure to nonprime consumer automotive financings has increased and we have seen some deterioration in nonprime credit tiers compared to prime credit tiers. We define nonprime consumer automotive loans primarily as those loans with a FICO\u00ae Score (or an equivalent score) at origination of less than 620. In addition, we have increased our used vehicle financing. Customers that finance used vehicles tend to have lower FICO\u00ae Scores as compared to new vehicle customers, and defaults resulting from vehicle breakdowns are more likely to occur with used vehicles as compared to new vehicles that are financed. The carrying value of our Automotive Finance operations nonprime consumer automotive loans before allowance for loan losses was $9.1 billion, or approximately 13.8% of our total consumer automotive loans, at December 31, 2016, as compared to $9.0 billion, or approximately 14.0% of our total consumer automotive loans, at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2016, and 2015, $211 million and $161 million, respectively, of nonprime consumer automotive loans were considered nonperforming as they had been placed on nonaccrual status in accordance with our accounting policies. Refer to the Nonaccrual Loans section of Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. If our exposure to nonprime consumer automotive financing loans continues to increase over time, our credit risk will increase to a possibly significant degree. As part of the underwriting process, we rely heavily upon information supplied by third parties. If any of this information is intentionally or negligently misrepresented and the misrepresentation is not detected before completing the transaction, we may experience increased credit risk from having engaged in the transaction.\nWe have dealer-centric automotive finance and insurance businesses, and a change in the key role of dealers within the automotive industry or our ability to maintain or build relationships with them could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects.\nOur Dealer Financial Services business, which includes our Automotive Finance and Insurance segments, depends on the continuation of the key role of dealers within the automotive industry, the maintenance of our existing relationships with dealers, and our creation of new relationships with dealers. Refer to the section titled Our Business in the MD&A that follows.\nA number of trends are affecting the automotive industry and the role of dealers within it. These include challenges to the dealer\u2019s role as intermediary between manufacturers and purchasers, the rise of vehicle sharing and ride hailing, the development of autonomous and alternative-energy vehicles, the impact of demographic shifts on attitudes and behaviors toward vehicle ownership and use, changing expectations around the vehicle buying experience, adjustments in the geographic distribution of new and used vehicle sales, and advancements in communications technology. Any one or more of these trends could adversely affect the key role of dealers and their business models, profitability, and viability, and if this were to occur, our dealer-centric automotive finance and insurance businesses could suffer as well.\nWhile the number of dealers with whom we have retail relationships increased during 2016, the number of dealers with whom we have wholesale relationships decreased approximately 3% as compared to December 31, 2015. Further, our share of commercial wholesale financing remains at risk of decreasing in the future. If we are not able to maintain existing relationships with significant automotive dealers or if we are not able to develop new relationships for any reason-including if we are not able to provide services on a timely basis, offer products that meet the needs of the dealers, or compete successfully with the products and services of our competitors-our wholesale funding volumes, and the number of dealers with whom we have retail funding relationships, could decline in the future. If this occurs, our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects could be adversely affected.\nGM and Chrysler dealers and their retail customers continue to constitute a significant portion of our customer base, which creates concentration risk for us.\nWhile we are continuing to diversify our automotive finance and insurance businesses and to expand into other financial services, GM and Chrysler dealers and their retail customers continue to constitute a significant portion of our customer base. In 2016, 54% of our new vehicle dealer inventory financing and 36% of our vehicle consumer automotive financing volume were transacted for GM-franchised dealers and customers, and 32% of our new vehicle dealer inventory financing and 28% of our vehicle consumer automotive financing volume were transacted for Chrysler dealers and customers. GM, Chrysler, and their captive finance companies compete forcefully with us and could take further actions that negatively impact the amount of business that we do with GM and Chrysler dealers and their retail customers. Further, a\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nsignificant adverse change in GM\u2019s or Chrysler\u2019s business-including, for example, in the production or sale of GM or Chrysler vehicles, the quality or resale value of GM or Chrysler vehicles, GM\u2019s or Chrysler\u2019s relationships with its key suppliers, or the rate or volume of recalls of GM or Chrysler vehicles-could negatively impact our GM and Chrysler dealer and retail customer bases. Any future reductions in GM and Chrysler business that we are not able to offset could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nOur allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses, and we may be required to significantly increase our allowance, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expenses and which represents management\u2019s best estimate of probable credit losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans. Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The allowance is established to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio. Any increase in the allowance results in an associated decrease in net income and capital and, if significant, may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks using existing qualitative and quantitative information, all of which may change substantially over time. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, revisions to accounting rules and related guidance, new qualitative or quantitative information about existing loans, identification of additional problem loans, changes in the size or composition of our loan portfolio, and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses. In addition, our shift to a full credit spectrum retail automotive finance portfolio mix has increased our allowance for loan losses and will likely increase our allowance for loan losses in the future.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, which introduces a new accounting model to measure credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost. The amendments, effective on January 1, 2020, represent a significant departure from existing accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), which upon adoption are likely to substantially increase our allowance for loan losses with a resulting negative adjustment to equity. This increase to the allowance for loan losses could also adversely impact capital if the FRB and other banking agencies do not amend existing regulatory capital rules to relieve us from the capital impact associated with the adoption of this guidance.\nRegulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses, as well as our methodology for calculating our allowance for loan losses, and from time to time may insist on an increase in the allowance for loan losses or the recognition of additional loan charge-offs based on judgments different than those of management. If these differences in judgment are considerable, our allowance could meaningfully increase and result in a sizable decrease in our net income and capital.\nOur business and financial results are dependent upon overall U.S. automotive industry sales volume.\nOur automotive finance and insurance businesses can be impacted by sales volume for new and used vehicles. Vehicle sales are impacted by several economic and market conditions, including employment levels, household income, credit availability, and fuel costs. For example, new vehicle sales decreased dramatically during the economic crisis that began in 2008 and did not rebound significantly until 2012 and 2013. Any future declines in new or used vehicle sales could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nThe levels of or changes in interest rates could affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are highly dependent on net interest income, which is the difference between interest income on earning assets (such as loans and investments) and interest expense on deposits and borrowings. Net interest income is significantly affected by market rates of interest, which in turn are influenced by monetary and fiscal policies, general economic conditions, the regulatory environment, competitive pressures, and expectations about future changes in interest rates. We may be adversely affected by policies, laws, or events that have the effect of flattening or inverting the yield curve (that is, the difference between long-term and short-term interest rates), depressing the interest rates associated with our earning assets to levels near the rates associated with our interest expense, or changing the spreads among different interest rate indices.\nThe levels of or changes in interest rates could adversely affect us beyond our net interest income, including the following:\n\u2022\nincrease the cost or decrease the availability of deposits or other variable-rate funding instruments;\n\u2022\nreduce the return on or demand for loans or increase the prepayment speed of loans;\n\u2022\nincrease customer or counterparty delinquencies or defaults;\n\u2022\nnegatively impact our ability to remarket off-lease and repossessed vehicles; and\n\u2022\nreduce the value of our loans, retained interests in securitizations, and fixed-income securities in our investment portfolio and the efficacy of our hedging strategies.\nThe level of and changes in market rates of interest-and, as a result, these risks and uncertainties-are beyond our control. The dynamics among these risks and uncertainties are also challenging to assess and manage. For example, while the highly accommodative\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nmonetary policy currently adopted by the FRB may benefit us to some degree by spurring economic activity among our customers, such a policy may ultimately cause us more harm by inhibiting our ability to grow or sustain net interest income. Refer to the section titled Market Risk in the MD&A that follows and Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nA failure of or interruption in, as well as cyber and other security risks associated with, the communications and other information systems on which we rely to conduct our business and operations could adversely affect us.\nWe rely heavily upon communications and other information systems to conduct our business and operations, which creates meaningful operational risk for us. Any failure of or interruption in our information systems or the third-party information systems on which we rely-including as a result of inadequate or failed technology or processes, human errors, fraud or other misconduct by employees or service providers, deficiencies in the integration of acquisitions or commencement of new businesses, catastrophic events, external or internal security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, malware, misplaced or lost data, or breakdowns in business continuity plans-could cause failures or delays in receiving applications for loans, underwriting or processing loans, servicing loans, accessing online bank accounts, processing transactions, executing brokerage orders, managing our investment portfolio, or conducting our internal operations. As a digital financial services company, we are susceptible to business, reputational, financial, regulatory, or other harm as a result of these risks.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect, store, and transmit sensitive, confidential, or proprietary data or other information, including business information, intellectual property, and the personally identifiable information of customers and employees. The secure processing, storage, maintenance, and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and reputation, and if any of this information were mishandled, misused, improperly accessed, lost, or stolen or if our operations were disabled or otherwise disrupted, we could suffer significant business, reputational, financial, regulatory, or other damage. For example, despite security measures, our communications and other information systems could be susceptible to computer viruses or malware, pretext calls, electronic phishing, hacking, identity theft, or other intrusions. Information security risks for large financial institutions like us are rapidly evolving and increasing in scope and complexity, in part, because of the introduction of new technologies, the expanded use of the internet and telecommunications technologies (including mobile devices) to conduct financial and other business transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, perpetrators of fraud, hackers, terrorists, and others. We may not be able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches, especially because the techniques used change frequently and because attacks can originate with no warning from a wide variety of sources around the globe. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. Service providers and counterparties also present a source of risk to us if their own security measures or other systems or infrastructure were to be breached or otherwise fail. Likewise, a cyber-attack or other security breach affecting the business community, the markets, or parts of them may cycle or cascade through the financial system and adversely affect us. Many if not all of these risks and uncertainties are beyond our control. Refer to section titled Risk Management in the MD&A that follows.\nEven when a failure of or interruption in our communications or other information systems is timely resolved or an attempted cyber incident or other security breach is successfully avoided or thwarted, we may need to expend substantial resources in doing so, may be required to take actions that could adversely affect customer satisfaction or behavior, and may be exposed to reputational damage. In the case of a failure, interruption, or breach, moreover, we could be exposed to contractual claims, regulatory actions, or litigation by private plaintiffs.\nWe are heavily reliant on technology, and a failure in effectively implementing technology initiatives or anticipating future technology needs or demands could adversely affect our business or financial results.\nWe significantly depend on technology to deliver our products and other services and to otherwise conduct business. To remain technologically competitive and operationally efficient, we invest in system upgrades, new solutions, and other technology initiatives. Many of these initiatives take a significant amount of time to develop and implement, are tied to critical systems, and require substantial resources. Although we take steps to mitigate the risks and uncertainties associated with these initiatives, no assurance can be provided that they will be implemented on time, within budget, or without negative operational or customer impact. We also may not succeed in anticipating future technology needs, the technology demands of customers, or the competitive landscape for technology. If we were to misstep in any of these areas, our business or financial results could be negatively impacted.\nOur risk-management and compliance programs or functions may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss.\nWe maintain an enterprise risk management program that is designed to identify, quantify, monitor, report, and control the risks that we face. These include credit, insurance/underwriting, vehicle-residual, market, liquidity, business/strategic, reputation, and operational risks. We also maintain a compliance program to identify, measure, assess, and report on our adherence to applicable law, policies, and procedures. There can be no assurance that our frameworks or models for risk management, compliance, and related controls will effectively mitigate risk and limit losses in our business. If conditions or circumstances arise that expose flaws or gaps in our risk management or compliance programs or if our controls break down, the performance and value of our business could be adversely affected. We could be negatively impacted as well if, despite adequate programs being in place, our risk management or compliance personnel are ineffective in executing them and mitigating risk and loss. Refer to the section titled Risk Management in the MD&A that follows.\nWe are or may be subject to potential liability in connection with pending or threatened legal proceedings and other matters, which could adversely affect our business or financial results.\nWe are involved from time to time in a variety of judicial, alternative-dispute, and other proceedings arising out of our business and operations. These legal matters may be formal or informal and include litigation and arbitration with one or more identified claimants,\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\ncertified or purported class actions with yet-to-be-identified claimants, and regulatory or other governmental information-gathering requests, examinations, investigations, and enforcement proceedings. Our legal matters exist in varying stages of adjudication, arbitration, negotiation, or investigation and span our lines of business and operations. Claims may be based in law or equity-such as those arising under contracts or in tort and those involving banking, consumer protection, securities, tax, employment, and other laws-and some can present novel legal theories and allege substantial or indeterminate damages.\nThe course and outcome of legal matters are inherently unpredictable. This is especially so when a matter is still in its early stages, the damages sought are indeterminate or unsupported, significant facts are unclear or disputed, novel questions of law or other meaningful legal uncertainties exist, a request to certify a proceeding as a class action is outstanding or granted, multiple parties are named, or regulatory or other governmental entities are involved. As a result, we cannot state with confidence how or when threatened or pending legal matters will be resolved and what losses may be incurred. Actual losses may be higher or lower than any amounts accrued for those matters, possibly to a significant degree. Refer to Note 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, while we maintain insurance policies to mitigate the cost of litigation and other proceedings, these policies have deductibles, limits, and exclusions that may diminish their value or efficacy. Substantial legal claims, even if not meritorious, could have a detrimental impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition and could cause us reputational harm.\nOur inability to attract, retain, or motivate qualified employees could adversely affect our business or performance.\nSkilled employees are our most important resource, and competition for talented people is intense. Even though compensation is among our highest expenses, we may not be able to locate and hire the best people, keep them with us, or properly motivate them to perform at a high level. Recent scrutiny of compensation practices, especially in the financial services industry, has made this only more difficult. In addition, many parts of our business are particularly dependent on key personnel. If we were to lose and find ourselves unable to replace these personnel or other skilled employees or if the competition for talent were to drive our compensation costs to unsustainable levels, our business and financial results could be negatively impacted.\nOur ability to successfully make opportunistic acquisitions is subject to significant risks, including the risk that government authorities will not provide the requisite approvals, the risk that integrating acquisitions may be more difficult, costly, or time consuming than expected, and the risk that the value of acquisitions may be less than anticipated.\nWhile currently not a strategic priority, we may from time to time seek to make opportunistic acquisitions of other financial services companies or businesses. These acquisitions may be subject to regulatory approval, and no assurance can be provided that we will be able to obtain that approval in a timely manner or at all. Even when we are able to obtain regulatory approval, the failure of other closing conditions to be satisfied or waived could delay the completion of an acquisition for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring altogether. Any failure or delay in closing an acquisition could adversely affect our reputation, business, and performance.\nIn addition, acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including lower-than-expected performance or higher-than-expected costs, difficulties related to integration, diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business activities, changes in relationships with customers or counterparties, and the potential loss of key employees. An acquisition also could be dilutive to our existing shareholders if we were to issue common stock to fully or partially pay or fund the purchase price. We, moreover, may not be successful in identifying acquisition candidates, integrating acquired companies or businesses, or realizing expected value from acquisitions. There is significant competition for valuable acquisition targets, and we may not be able to acquire other companies or businesses on attractive terms. No assurance can be given that we will pursue future acquisitions, and our ability to grow and successfully compete may be impaired if we choose not to pursue or are unable to successfully make acquisitions.\nVehicle loans and leases make up a significant part of our earning assets, and our business and financial results could suffer if used vehicle prices are low or volatile or decrease in the future.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, more than 85% of our earning assets were composed of vehicle loans or leases or related residual securitization interests. If we experience higher losses on the sale of repossessed vehicles or lower or more volatile residual values for off-lease vehicles, our business or financial results could be adversely affected.\nGeneral economic conditions, the supply of off-lease and other vehicles to be sold, vehicle market prices, perceived vehicle quality, overall price, the vehicle disposition channel, volatility in gasoline or diesel fuel prices, levels of household income, and other factors outside of our control heavily influence used vehicle prices. Consumer confidence levels and the strength of automotive manufacturers and dealers can also influence the used vehicle market. For example, when the recent economic crisis began in 2008, sharp declines in used vehicle demand and sale prices adversely affected our remarketing proceeds and financial results.\nOur expectation of the residual value of a vehicle subject to an automotive lease contract is a critical element used to determine the amount of the lease payments under the contract at the time the customer enters into it. As a result, to the extent that the actual residual value of the vehicle-as reflected in the sales proceeds received upon remarketing at lease termination-is less than the expected residual value for the vehicle at lease inception, we will incur additional depreciation expense and lower profit on the lease transaction than our priced expectation. Our expectation of levels of used vehicle values is also combined with our estimate of loss frequency to arrive at our projected net average annualized loss rate (NAALR), which is a factor in determining our pricing of new loan and lease originations. To the extent that used vehicle prices are significantly lower than our expectations, our profit on vehicle loans and leases could be substantially less than our expectations, even more so if our estimate of loss frequency is underestimated as well. In addition, we could be adversely affected if we fail to\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nefficiently process and effectively market off-lease vehicles and repossessed vehicles and, as a consequence, incur higher-than-expected disposal costs or lower-than-expected proceeds from the vehicle sales.\nOur business requires substantial capital and liquidity, and a disruption in our funding sources or access to the capital markets may have an adverse effect on our liquidity, capital positions, and financial condition.\nLiquidity is the ability to fund increases in assets and meet obligations as they come due, all without incurring unacceptable losses. Banks are especially vulnerable to liquidity risk because of their role in the maturity transformation of demand or short-term deposits into longer-term loans or other extensions of credit. We, like other financial services companies, rely to a significant extent on external sources of funding (such as deposits and borrowings) for the liquidity needed to conduct our business and operations. A number of factors beyond our control, however, could have a detrimental impact on the availability or cost of that funding and thus on our liquidity. These include market disruptions, changes in our credit ratings or the sentiment of our investors, the state of the regulatory environment and monetary and fiscal policies, reputational damage, financial or systemic shocks, and significant counterparty failures. Unexpected declines or limits on dividends or other distributions from our subsidiaries also could adversely affect Ally\u2019s liquidity position.\nWe have significant maturities of unsecured debt each year. While we have reduced our reliance on unsecured funding in recent years, it remains an important component of our capital structure and financing plans. At December 31, 2016, approximately $4.4 billion in principal amount of total outstanding consolidated unsecured debt is scheduled to mature in 2017, and approximately $3.7 billion and $1.7 billion in principal amount of consolidated unsecured debt is scheduled to mature in 2018 and 2019, respectively. We also obtain short-term funding from the sale of floating-rate demand notes, all of which the holders may elect to have redeemed at any time without restriction. At December 31, 2016, a total of $3.6 billion in principal amount of demand notes were outstanding. We also rely substantially on secured funding. At December 31, 2016, approximately $10.3 billion of outstanding consolidated secured long-term debt is scheduled to mature in 2017, approximately $8.2 billion is scheduled to mature in 2018, and approximately $7.3 billion is scheduled to mature in 2019. Furthermore, at December 31, 2016, approximately $16.2 billion in certificates of deposit at Ally Bank are scheduled to mature in 2017, which is not included in the 2017 unsecured maturities provided above. Additional financing will be required to fund a substantial portion of the debt maturities over these periods.\nWe continue to rely as well on our ability to borrow from other financial institutions, and many of our primary bank facilities are up for renewal on a yearly basis. Any weakness in market conditions, tightening of credit availability, or other events referenced earlier in this risk factor could have a negative effect on our ability to refinance these facilities and could increase the costs of bank funding. Ally and Ally Bank also continue to access the securitization markets. While those markets have continued to stabilize following the liquidity crisis that commenced in 2008, there can be no assurances that these sources of liquidity will remain available to us.\nOur policies and controls are designed to ensure that we maintain adequate liquidity to conduct our business in the ordinary course even in a stressed environment. There is no guarantee, however, that our liquidity position will never become compromised. In such an event, we may be required to sell assets at a loss or reduce loan and lease originations in order to continue operations. This could damage the performance and value of our business, prompt regulatory intervention, and harm our reputation, and if the condition were to persist for any appreciable period of time, our viability as a going concern could be threatened. Refer to section titled Liquidity Management, Funding, and Regulatory Capital in the MD&A that follows and Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur indebtedness and other obligations are significant and could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness. At December 31, 2016, we had approximately $67.9 billion in principal amount of indebtedness outstanding (including $43.2 billion in secured indebtedness). Interest expense on our indebtedness constituted approximately 22% of our total financing revenue and other interest income for the year ended December 31, 2016. We also have the ability to create additional unsecured indebtedness.\nIf our debt service obligations increase, whether due to the increased cost of existing indebtedness or the incurrence of additional indebtedness, we may be required to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, which would reduce the funds available for other purposes. Our indebtedness also could limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions. In addition, if we are unable to satisfy our indebtedness and other obligations in full and on time, our business, reputation, and value as a going concern could be profoundly and perhaps inexorably damaged.\nThe markets for automotive financing, insurance, mortgage, banking, and brokerage are extremely competitive, and competitive pressures could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nThe markets for automotive financing, insurance, mortgage, banking, and brokerage are highly competitive, and we expect competitive pressures only to intensify in the future, especially in light of legislative and regulatory initiatives arising out of the recent global economic crisis, technological innovations that alter the barriers to entry, current and evolving economic and market conditions, and government monetary and fiscal policies. Refer to the section above titled Industry and Competition in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Competitive pressures may drive us to take actions that we might otherwise eschew, such as lowering the interest rates or fees on loans, raising the interest rates on deposits, or adopting more liberal underwriting standards. These pressures also may accelerate actions that we might otherwise elect to defer, such as substantial investments in technology or infrastructure. Whatever the reason, actions that we take in response to competition may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. These consequences could be exacerbated if we are not successful in\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nintroducing new products and other services, achieving market acceptance of our products and other services, developing and maintaining a strong customer base, or prudently managing expenses.\nOur borrowing costs and access to the banking and capital markets could be negatively impacted if our credit ratings are downgraded or otherwise fail to meet investor expectations or demands.\nThe cost and availability of our funding are meaningfully affected by our short- and long-term credit ratings. Each of Standard & Poor\u2019s Rating Services, Moody\u2019s Investors Service, Inc., Fitch, Inc., and Dominion Bond Rating Service rates some or all of our debt, and these ratings reflect the rating agency\u2019s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance, strategic position, and ability to meet our obligations. Agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security and may be revised or withdrawn at any time. Each agency\u2019s rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency\u2019s rating.\nSome of our current credit ratings are below investment grade, which negatively impacts our access to liquidity and increases our borrowing costs in the banking and capital markets. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded further or were to otherwise fail to meet investor expectations or demands, our borrowing costs and access to the banking and capital markets could become even more challenging and, as a result, negatively affect our business and financial results. In addition, downgrades of our credit ratings or their failure to meet investor expectations or demands could result in additional terms and conditions being added to any new or replacement financing arrangements as well as trigger disadvantageous provisions of existing borrowing arrangements.\nChallenging business, economic, or market conditions may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur businesses are driven by wealth creation in the economy, robust market activity, monetary and fiscal stability, and positive investor, business, and consumer sentiment. A downturn in economic conditions, disruptions in the equity or debt markets, high unemployment or underemployment, depressed vehicle or housing prices, unsustainable debt levels, declines in household incomes, deteriorating consumer or business sentiment, consumer or commercial bankruptcy filings, or declines in the strength of national or local economies could decrease demand for our products and services, increase the amount and rate of delinquencies and losses, and negatively impact the returns on and the value of our investment portfolio and other assets. Further, if a significant and sustained increase in fuel prices or other adverse conditions were to lead to diminished new and used vehicle purchases, our automotive finance and insurance businesses could suffer considerably. In addition, concerns about the pace of economic growth and uncertainty about fiscal and monetary policies can result in significant volatility in the financial markets and could impact our ability to obtain cost-effective funding. If any of these events were to occur or worsen, our business, results of operation, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nActs or threats of terrorism, natural disasters, and other conditions or events beyond our control could adversely affect us.\nGeopolitical conditions, natural disasters, and other conditions or events beyond our control may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects. For example, acts or threats of terrorism and political or military actions taken in response to terrorism could adversely affect general economic, business, or market conditions and, in turn, us. We also could be negatively impacted if our key personnel, a significant number of our employees, or our systems or infrastructure were to become unavailable or damaged due to a pandemic, natural disaster, war, act of terrorism, accident, or similar cause. These same risks and uncertainties arise too for the service providers and counterparties on whom we depend as well as their own third-party service providers and counterparties.\nSignificant repurchases or indemnification payments in our securitizations or whole-loan sales could harm our profitability and financial condition.\nWe have repurchase and indemnification obligations in our securitizations and whole-loan sales. If we were to breach a representation, warranty, or covenant in connection with a securitization or whole-loan sale, we may be required to repurchase the affected loans or leases or otherwise compensate investors or purchasers for losses caused by the breach. If the scale or frequency of repurchases or indemnification payments were to increase substantially from its present levels, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur business and operations make extensive use of models, and we could be adversely affected if our design, implementation, or use of models is flawed.\nWe use quantitative models to price products and services, measure risk, estimate asset and liability values, assess capital and liquidity, manage our balance sheet, create financial forecasts, and otherwise conduct our business and operations. If the design, implementation, or use of any of these models is flawed, we could make strategic or tactical decisions based on incorrect, misleading, or incomplete information. In addition, to the extent that any inaccurate model outputs are used in reports to banking agencies or the public, we could be subjected to supervisory actions, litigation, and other proceedings that may adversely affect our business and financial results. Refer to section titled Risk Management in the MD&A that follows.\nOur hedging strategies may not be successful in mitigating our interest rate, foreign exchange, and market risks, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe employ various hedging strategies to mitigate the interest rate, foreign exchange, and market risks inherent in many of our assets and liabilities. Our hedging strategies rely considerably on assumptions and projections regarding our assets and liabilities as well as general market factors. If any of these assumptions or projections prove to be incorrect or our hedges do not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and other market factors, we may experience volatility in our earnings that could adversely\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\naffect our profitability and financial condition. In addition, we may not be able to find market participants that are willing to act as our hedging counterparties on acceptable terms or at all, which could have an adverse effect on the success of our hedging strategies.\nWe use estimates and assumptions in determining the fair value of many of our assets. If our estimates or assumptions prove to be incorrect, our cash flow, profitability, financial condition, and business prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe use estimates and various assumptions in determining the fair value of many of our assets, including retained interests from securitizations, loans held-for-sale, and other investments that do not have an established market value or are not publicly traded. We also use estimates and assumptions in determining the residual values of leased vehicles. In addition, we use estimates and assumptions in determining our reserves for legal matters, insurance losses, and loss adjustment expenses (which represent the accumulation of estimates for both reported losses and those incurred, but not reported, including claims adjustment expenses relating to direct insurance and assumed reinsurance agreements). Refer to section titled Critical Accounting Estimates in the MD&A that follows. Our assumptions and estimates may be inaccurate for many reasons. For example, they often involve matters that are inherently difficult to predict and that are beyond our control (such as macroeconomic conditions and their impact on our dealers) and often involve complex interactions between a number of dependent and independent variables, factors, and other assumptions. Assumptions and estimates are also far more difficult during periods of market dislocation or illiquidity. As a result, our actual experience may differ substantially from these estimates and assumptions. A meaningful difference between our estimates and assumptions and our actual experience may adversely affect our cash flow, profitability, financial condition, and business prospects and may increase the volatility of our financial results. In addition, several different judgments associated with assumptions or estimates could be reasonable under the circumstances and yet result in significantly different results being reported.\nSignificant fluctuations in the valuation of investment securities or market prices could negatively affect our financial results.\nMarket prices for securities and other financial assets are subject to considerable fluctuation. Fluctuations may result, for example, from perceived changes in the value of the asset, the relative price of alternative investments, geopolitical events, actual or expected changes in monetary or fiscal policies, and general market conditions. Due to these kinds of fluctuations, the amount that we realize in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the last reported value and could negatively affect our financial results. Additionally, negative fluctuations in the value of available-for-sale investment securities could result in unrealized losses recorded in equity.\nChanges in accounting standards could adversely affect our reported revenues, expenses, profitability, and financial condition.\nOur financial statements are subject to the application of GAAP, which are periodically revised or expanded. The application of GAAP is also subject to varying interpretations over time. Accordingly, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or comply with revised interpretations that are issued from time to time by various parties, including accounting standard setters and those who interpret the standards, such as the FASB, the SEC, banking agencies, and our independent registered public accounting firm. Those changes are beyond our control but could adversely affect our revenues, expenses, profitability, or financial condition. Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for several financial accounting standards issued by the FASB during 2016 with effective dates between January 1, 2018, and January 1, 2020.\nThe financial system is highly interrelated, and the failure of even a single financial institution could adversely affect us.\nThe financial system is highly interrelated, including as a result of lending, trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to and routinely execute transactions with a wide variety of financial institutions, including brokers, dealers, commercial banks, and investment banks. If any of these institutions were to fail in meeting its obligations in full and on time or were to enter bankruptcy, conservatorship, or receivership, the consequences could ripple throughout the financial system and may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects.\nAdverse economic conditions or changes in laws in the states where we have loan or lease concentrations may negatively affect our business and financial results.\nWe are exposed to portfolio concentrations in some states, including California, Texas, and Florida. Factors adversely affecting the economies and applicable laws in these states could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nNegative publicity outside of our control, or our failure to successfully manage issues arising from our conduct or in connection with the financial services industry generally, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business or financial results.\nThe performance and value of our business could be negatively impacted by any reputational harm that we may suffer. This harm could arise from negative publicity outside of our control or our failure to adequately address issues arising from our conduct or in connection with the financial services industry generally. Risks to our reputation could arise in any number of contexts-for example, continuing government responses to the recent global economic crisis, cyber incidents and other security breaches, mergers and acquisitions, lending or banking practices, actual or potential conflicts of interest, failures to prevent money laundering, and corporate governance.\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur ability to pay dividends on our common stock or repurchase shares in the future may be limited.\nAny future dividends on our common stock or share repurchases will be determined by our Board of Directors in its sole discretion and will depend on our business, financial condition, earnings, capital, liquidity, and other factors at the time. In addition, any plans to continue dividends or share repurchases in the future will be subject to the FRB\u2019s review of and non-objection to our capital plan, which is unpredictable. Refer to the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report. There is no assurance that our Board of Directors will approve, or the FRB will permit, future dividends or share repurchases.\nIt is possible that any indentures or other financing arrangements that we execute in the future could limit our ability to pay dividends on our capital stock, including our common stock. In the event that any of our indentures or other financing arrangements in the future restrict that ability, we may be unable to pay dividends unless and until we can refinance the amounts outstanding under those arrangements. In addition, under Delaware law, our Board of Directors may declare dividends on our capital stock only to the extent of our statutory surplus (which is defined as the amount equal to total assets minus total liabilities, in each case at fair market value, minus statutory capital) or, if no surplus exists, out of our net profits for the then-current or immediately preceding fiscal year. Further, even if we are permitted under our contractual obligations and Delaware law to pay dividends on our common stock, we may not have sufficient cash or regulatory approvals to do so.\nThe market price of our common stock could be adversely impacted by anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law that could delay or prevent a takeover attempt or change in control of Ally or and by other banking, antitrust, or corporate laws that have or are perceived as having an anti-takeover effect.\nOur certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, and Delaware law contain provisions that could have the effect of discouraging, hindering, or preventing an acquisition that our Board of Directors does not find to be in the best interests of us and our stockholders. For example, our organizational documents include provisions:\n\u2022\nlimiting the liability of our directors and providing indemnification to our directors and officers; and\n\u2022\nlimiting the ability of our stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings of stockholders by requiring any requesting stockholders to hold at least 25% of our common shares in the aggregate.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control of Ally or changes in management.\nIn addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which generally prohibits a corporation from engaging in various business combination transactions with any interested stockholder (generally defined as a stockholder who owns 15% or more of a corporation\u2019s voting stock) for a period of three years following the time that the stockholder became an interested stockholder, except under specified circumstances such as the receipt of prior board approval.\nBanking and antitrust laws, including associated regulatory-approval requirements, also impose significant restrictions on the acquisition of direct or indirect control over any bank holding company like us.\nAny provision of our organizational documents or applicable law that deters, hinders, or prevents a non-negotiated takeover or change in control of Ally could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.", "PERMNO": 14558, "SIC": 6172, "TIC": "ALLY"}
