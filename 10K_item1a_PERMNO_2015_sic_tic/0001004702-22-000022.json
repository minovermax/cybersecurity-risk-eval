{"cik": "1004702", "company": "OCEANFIRST FINANCIAL CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in the Company\u2019s common stock or the Series A Preferred Stock involves risks. Stockholders should carefully consider the risks described below, together with other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and that was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d), before making any purchase or sale decisions regarding the Company\u2019s common stock or Series A Preferred Stock. If any of the following risks actually occur, the Company\u2019s financial condition or operating results may be harmed. In that case, the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock may decline and stockholders may lose part or all of their investment in the Company\u2019s common stock or Series A Preferred Stock.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and measures intended to prevent its spread could continue to adversely affect the Company\u2019s business activities, financial condition, and results of operations and such effects will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict. Global health concerns relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and related government actions taken to reduce the spread of the virus have continued to affect the macroeconomic environment, both nationally and in the Company\u2019s existing geographic footprint. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to federal, state, and local governments enacting various restrictions in an attempt to limit the spread of the virus, and along with various federal agencies, have led to measures to address the economic and social consequences of the pandemic. There can be no assurance that the steps taken by the U.S. or state governments will be effective or achieve their desired results in a timely fashion. Additionally, there can be no assurance that federal and state agencies will not pass further measures that provide accommodations that could impact the Company\u2019s financial results.\nFurthermore, the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company\u2019s business activities as a result of new government and regulatory policies, programs, and guidelines, as well as market reactions to such activities, remains uncertain.\nThe economic effects of the COVID-19 outbreak have had a destabilizing effect on financial markets, key market indices, and overall economic activity. The uncertainty regarding the duration of the pandemic and the resulting economic disruption has caused increased market volatility and may further depress economic activity and/or consumer confidence and business generally. The continuation of these conditions caused by the pandemic, including the impacts of federal and state measures, can be expected to adversely impact the Company\u2019s businesses and results of operations and the operations of borrowers, customers, and business partners. In particular, these events may (i) adversely affect customer deposits and the stability of the Company\u2019s deposit base, or otherwise impair liquidity, (ii) impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans or other obligations, resulting in increases in delinquencies, (iii) reduce the demand for loans, wealth management revenues, or the demand for other products and services, (iv) impact the creditworthiness of potential and current borrowers, (v) negatively impact the productivity and availability of key personnel and other employees necessary to conduct business, and of third-party service providers who perform critical services, or otherwise cause operational failures due to changes in normal business\npractices necessitated by or issues with employee retention caused by the pandemic and related governmental actions or otherwise, (vi) impair the ability of loan guarantors to honor commitments, (vii) impair the value of the collateral securing loans (particularly with respect to real estate), (viii) impair the value of the securities portfolio, (ix) require an increase in the allowance for credit losses, (x) negatively impact regulatory capital ratios, (xi) increase cyber and payment fraud risk, given increased online and remote activity, (xii) result in increased compliance risk as the Company becomes subject to new regulatory and other requirements, and (xiii) broadly result in lost revenue and income.\nProlonged measures by public health or other governmental authorities encouraging or requiring significant restrictions on travel, assembly, or other core business practices would further harm the Bank\u2019s business and that of its customers, in particular small to medium-sized business customers. Although the Company has business continuity plans and other safeguards in place, there is no assurance that they will be effective. The ultimate impact of these factors is highly uncertain and the Company does not yet know the full extent of the impact on business, operations, or the global economy as a whole. However, the decline in economic conditions generally and a prolonged negative impact on small to medium-sized businesses, in particular, due to the COVID-19 pandemic could result in a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations and may heighten many of the known risks described herein and in other filings with the SEC.\nRisks Related to Lending Activities\nThe Bank\u2019s emphasis on commercial lending may expose the Bank to increased lending risks. At December 31, 2021, $5.88 billion, or 68.2%, of the Bank\u2019s total loans consisted of commercial real estate, multi-family real estate and land loans, and commercial and industrial loans. These portfolios have grown in recent years and the Bank intends to continue to emphasize these types of lending. These types of loans may expose a lender to greater risk of non-payment and loss than residential real estate loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation of the property or the borrower\u2019s business and the income stream of the borrowers. Such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to residential real estate loans. In addition, many of these loans were acquired through the Company\u2019s acquisitions, and were not underwritten by the Bank and were made to borrowers with whom the Company and the Bank do not have longstanding relationships.\nThe level of the commercial real estate loan portfolio may subject the Bank to additional regulatory scrutiny. The OCC and the other federal bank regulatory agencies have promulgated joint guidance on sound risk management practices for financial institutions with concentrations in commercial real estate lending. Under the guidance, a financial institution that, like the Bank, is actively involved in commercial real estate lending should perform a risk assessment to identify concentrations. A financial institution may be subject to this guidance if, among other factors, (i) total reported loans for construction, land acquisition and development and other land represent 100% or more of total capital, or (ii) total reported loans secured by multi-family and non-farm residential properties, loans for construction, land acquisition and development and other land, and loans otherwise sensitive to the general commercial real estate market, including loans to commercial real estate related entities, represent 300% or more of total capital. Based on these factors, the Bank has a concentration in multi-family and commercial real estate lending, as such loans represented 400% of total bank capital as of December 31, 2021. The guidance focuses on exposure to commercial real estate loans that are dependent on the cash flow from the real estate held as collateral and that are likely to be at greater risk to conditions in the commercial real estate market (as opposed to real estate collateral held as a secondary source of repayment or in an abundance of caution). The guidance assists banks in developing risk management practices and determining capital levels commensurate with the level and nature of real estate concentrations. The guidance states that management should employ heightened risk management practices including board and management oversight and strategic planning, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing. While it is management\u2019s belief that policies and procedures with respect to the Bank\u2019s commercial real estate loan portfolio have been implemented consistent with this guidance, bank regulators could require that additional policies and procedures be implemented consistent with their interpretation of the guidance that may result in additional costs or that may result in the curtailment of commercial real estate and multi-family lending that would adversely affect the Bank\u2019s loan originations and profitability.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act imposes obligations on originators of residential mortgage loans. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act requires originators to make a reasonable and good faith determination based on documented information that a borrower has a reasonable ability to repay a particular mortgage loan over the long term. If the originator cannot meet this standard, the burden is on the lender to demonstrate the appropriateness of its policies and the strength of its controls. The Dodd-Frank Act contains an exception from this Ability-To-Repay rule for \u201cQualified Mortgages.\u201d The rule sets forth specific underwriting criteria for a loan to qualify as a Qualified Mortgage. If a loan meets these criteria and is not a \u201chigher priced loan\u201d as defined in FRB regulations, the CFPB rule establishes a safe harbor preventing a consumer from asserting the failure of the originator to establish the consumer\u2019s Ability-To-Repay. Additionally, conforming fixed-rate loans with a debt-to-income ratio greater than 43% would also qualify as an Ability-To-Repay Qualified Mortgage based upon an automated loan approval from one of the government sponsored mortgage entities. However, a consumer may assert the lender\u2019s failure to comply with the Ability-To-\nRepay rule for all residential mortgage loans other than Qualified Mortgages, and may challenge whether a loan actually met the criteria to be deemed an Ability-to-Pay Qualified Mortgage. These challenges have yet to be addressed by the courts.\nAlthough the majority of residential mortgages historically originated by the Bank would be considered Qualified Mortgages, the Bank currently originates residential mortgage loans that do not qualify. As a result of the Ability-to-Repay rules, the Bank may experience loan losses, litigation-related expenses, and delays in taking title to real estate collateral in a foreclosure proceeding if these loans do not perform and borrowers challenge whether the Bank satisfied the Ability-To-Repay rule upon originating the loan.\nThe Bank\u2019s allowance for credit losses may be inadequate, which could hurt the Company\u2019s earnings. The Bank\u2019s allowance for credit losses may prove to be inadequate to cover actual credit losses. If the Bank is required to increase its allowance, current earnings may be reduced. The Bank provides for losses by reserving what it believes to be an adequate amount to absorb any estimated lifetime expected credit losses. A charge-off reduces the Bank\u2019s reserve for possible credit losses. If the Bank\u2019s reserves were insufficient, it would be required to record a reserve, which would reduce earnings for that period. Changes to the economic forecasts within the model could positively or negatively impact the actual results. Any increase in the allowance for credit losses, or expenses incurred to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses, may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to regulatory enforcement risk, reputation risk, and litigation risk regarding participation in the Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d) and is subject to the risk that the SBA may not fund some or all PPP loan guarantees. The CARES Act included the PPP as a loan program administered through the SBA. Under the PPP, small businesses and other entities and individuals can apply for loans from SBA lenders and other approved regulated lenders, subject to detailed qualifications and eligibility criteria.\nBecause of the short timeframe between the passing of the CARES Act and implementation of the PPP, some of the rules and guidance relating to PPP were issued after lenders began processing PPP applications. Also, there was and continues to be uncertainty in the laws, rules and guidance relating to the PPP. Since the opening of the PPP, several banks have been subject to litigation regarding the procedures used in processing PPP applications, and several banks have been subject to litigation regarding the payment of fees to agents that assisted borrowers in obtaining PPP loans. In addition, some banks and borrowers have received negative media attention associated with PPP loans. Although management believes the Company has administered the PPP in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations and guidance, the Company could be exposed to litigation risk and negative media attention related to its participation in the PPP. If any such litigation is not resolved in the Company\u2019s favor, it may result in significant financial liability or adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation. In addition, litigation can be costly, regardless of outcome. Any financial liability, litigation costs or reputational damage caused by PPP-related litigation or media attention could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe PPP has also attracted interest from federal and state enforcement authorities, oversight agencies, regulators, and U.S. Congressional committees. State Attorneys General and other federal and state agencies may assert that they are not subject to the provisions of the CARES Act and the PPP regulations entitling the Company to rely on borrower certifications, and take more aggressive action against the Company for alleged violations of the provisions governing the PPP. Federal and state regulators can impose or request that the Bank consents to substantial sanctions, restrictions, and requirements if they determine there are violations of laws, rules or regulations or weaknesses or failures with respect to general standards of safety and soundness, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation, business, reputation, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Company also has credit risk on PPP loans if the SBA determines that there is a deficiency in the manner in which the Company originated, funded or serviced loans, including any issue with the eligibility of a borrower to receive a PPP loan. In the event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there was a deficiency in the manner in which the Bank originated, funded or serviced a PPP loan, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty or, if the SBA has already paid under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from the Company.\nThe foreclosure process may adversely impact the Bank\u2019s recoveries on non-performing loans. The judicial foreclosure process is protracted, which delays the Company\u2019s ability to resolve non-performing loans through the sale of the underlying collateral. The longer timelines have been the result of the economic crisis, additional consumer protection initiatives related to the foreclosure process, increased documentary requirements and judicial scrutiny, and, both voluntary and mandatory programs under which lenders may consider loan modifications or other alternatives to foreclosure. These reasons and the legal and regulatory responses have impacted the foreclosure process and completion time of foreclosures for residential mortgage lenders. This may result in a material adverse effect on collateral values and the Bank\u2019s ability to minimize its losses.\nRisks Related to Economic Matters\nA worsening of economic conditions in the market area could reduce demand for the products and services and/or result in increases in the level of non-performing loans, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations. A deterioration in economic conditions, especially local conditions, as a result of COVID-19, inflation or otherwise, could have the following consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, and could more negatively affect the Company compared to a financial institution that operates with more geographic diversity:\n\u2022demand for the products and services may decline;\n\u2022loan delinquencies, problem assets, and foreclosures may increase;\n\u2022collateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, thereby reducing customers\u2019 borrowing power, and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with existing loans; and\n\u2022the net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments.\nMoreover, a significant decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation, recession, acts of terrorism, civil unrest, an outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic calamities, an epidemic or pandemic, unemployment or other factors beyond the Company\u2019s control could further impact these local economic conditions and could further negatively affect the financial results of banking operations. In addition, deflationary pressures, while possibly lowering operating costs, could have a significant negative effect on borrowers, especially business borrowers, and the values of underlying collateral securing loans, which could negatively affect financial performance.\nA downturn in the local economy or in local real estate values could adversely impact profits. Most of the Bank\u2019s loans are secured by real estate and are made to borrowers throughout New Jersey and the major metropolitan areas of Philadelphia, New York, Baltimore, Washington D.C., and Boston, as well as their surrounding areas. A downturn in the local economy or a decline in real estate values could increase the amount of non-performing loans and cause residential and commercial real estate loans to become inadequately collateralized, which could expose the Bank to a greater risk of loss.\nRisks Related to Acquisitions and Growth\nThe Company must successfully integrate the operations and retain the customers of its acquired institutions. The Company regularly completes acquisitions of financial institutions and continues to explore acquisition opportunities as part of its strategic plan. Future results of operations will depend in large part on the Company\u2019s ability to successfully integrate the operations of the institutions it acquires and retain the employees and customers of those institutions. If the Company is unable to successfully manage the integration of the separate cultures, employee and customer bases and operating systems of the institutions it acquires, the Company\u2019s results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s failure to successfully manage its growth may adversely impact its financial condition and results of operation. The Company may be challenged to successfully manage its business as a result of the strain on management and operations that may result from growth. The ability to manage growth will depend on its ability to continue to attract, hire and retain skilled employees. Success will also depend on the ability of officers and key employees to continue to implement and improve operational and other systems, to manage multiple, concurrent customer relationships and to hire, train and manage employees.\nIn addition, to successfully manage substantial growth, the Company may need to increase non-interest expenses through additional leasehold and data processing costs, and other infrastructure costs. In order to successfully manage growth, the Company may need to adopt and effectively implement new or revise existing policies, procedures and controls to maintain credit quality, control costs and oversee the Company\u2019s operations. No assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in these efforts.\nThe Company\u2019s intent to expand its geographic footprint may not be successful in entering into new markets. The Company intends to expand its geographic footprint through acquisitions and organic growth. Entering into new markets involves risks, such as competitive disadvantages through a lack of name recognition, increased marketing costs, and the inability to otherwise grow market share as needed to offset the costs associated with expansion. The failure to successfully implement a geographic growth strategy could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company may need to raise additional capital in the future and such capital may not be available when needed or at terms that are beneficial to stockholders. Substantial growth may stress regulatory capital levels, and may require the Company to raise additional capital. No assurance can be given that the Company will be able to raise any required capital, or that it will be able to raise capital on terms that are beneficial to stockholders.\nA significant portion of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio has grown through acquisition, and therefore may not have been underwritten to meet the Company\u2019s credit standards. Loans that were acquired as part of the Company\u2019s acquisitions of other depository institutions, were not underwritten or originated in accordance with the Company\u2019s credit standards, including environmental matters, and the Company did not have long-standing relationships with many of these borrowers at the time of acquisition. The acquired loans are re-risked at the date of acquisition based on the Company\u2019s credit standards, which can temporarily increase loans classified as special mention and substandard for a period of time until these loans are integrated and conform to the Company\u2019s credit standards. Although the Company reviewed the loan portfolios of each institution acquired as part of the diligence process, and believes that it has established reasonable credit marks with regard to all loans acquired, no assurance can be given that the Company will not incur losses in excess of the credit marks with regard to these acquired loans, or that any such losses, if they occur, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFuture acquisition activity could otherwise negatively affect financial condition and results of operations. The Company continues to evaluate opportunities to acquire institutions and/or bank branches. Acquiring other banks, businesses, or branches may have an adverse effect on financial results and may involve various other risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including those discussed above, as well as, among other things:\n\u2022payment of a premium over book and market values that may dilute the tangible book value and earnings per share in the short and long-term;\n\u2022potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company;\n\u2022exposure to potential asset quality problems of the target company;\n\u2022inability to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits of the acquisition;\n\u2022potential disruption to the business;\n\u2022potential diversion of management\u2019s time and attention;\n\u2022the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company; and\n\u2022potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target company.\nAcquisitions may reduce or not enhance cash flows, business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects as expected and, as a result, such acquisitions may have an adverse effect on the results of operations, particularly during periods in which the acquisitions are being integrated into operations.\nRisks Related to Interest Rates\nA continuation of the historically low interest rate environment and the possibility that the Company may access higher-cost funds to support loan growth and operations may adversely affect net interest income and profitability. In recent years, the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s policy has been to maintain interest rates at historically low levels through its targeted federal funds rate and the purchase of mortgage-backed, U.S government and agency securities. The Company\u2019s ability to reduce interest expense may be limited at current interest rate levels while the average yield on interest-earning assets may continue to decrease, and interest expense may increase as it may be necessary to access non-core funding sources or increase deposit rates to fund operations. A continuation of a low interest rate environment or an increase in cost of funds may adversely affect net interest income, which would have an adverse effect on profitability.\nChanges in interest rates could adversely affect results of operations and financial condition. The Bank\u2019s ability to make a profit largely depends on net interest income, which could be negatively affected by changes in interest rates. Interest-bearing liabilities generally have shorter contractual maturities than interest-earning assets. This imbalance can create significant earnings volatility as market interest rates change over time. In a period of rising interest rates, the interest income earned on interest-earning assets may not increase as rapidly as the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Additionally, a flat or an inverted yield curve, where short-term rates are close to, or above, long-term rates, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, changes in interest rates can affect the average life of loans and investment securities. A reduction in interest rates causes increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed securities as borrowers refinance their debt to reduce their borrowing costs. This creates reinvestment risk, which is the risk that the Bank may not be able to reinvest the funds from faster prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates earned on the prepaid loans or securities. Conversely, an increase in interest rates generally reduces prepayments. Additionally, increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand and/or make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable-rate loans.\nChanges in interest rates may also affect the current estimated fair value of the securities portfolio. Generally, the value of securities moves inversely with changes in interest rates. Unrealized net losses on securities available-for-sale are reported as a\nseparate component of stockholders\u2019 equity. To the extent interest rates increase and the value of the available-for-sale portfolio decreases, stockholders\u2019 equity will be adversely affected.\nChanges in the estimated fair value of debt securities may reduce stockholders\u2019 equity and net income. At December 31, 2021, the Company maintained a debt securities portfolio of $1.71 billion, of which $568.3 million was classified as available-for-sale. The estimated fair value of the available-for-sale debt securities portfolio may change depending on the credit quality of the underlying issuer, market liquidity, changes in interest rates and other factors. Stockholders\u2019 equity is increased or decreased by the amount of the change in the unrealized gain or loss (difference between the estimated fair value and the amortized cost) of the available-for-sale debt securities portfolio, net of the related tax expense or benefit, under the category of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Therefore, a decline in the estimated fair value of this portfolio will result in a decline in reported stockholders\u2019 equity, as well as book value per common share. The decrease will occur even though the securities are not sold.\nThe Company conducts a periodic review of the debt securities portfolio to determine if any decline in the estimated fair value of any security below its cost basis is considered impaired. Factors which are considered in the analysis include, but are not limited to, the extent to which the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, the financial condition, credit rating and future prospects of the issuer, whether the debtor is current on contractually obligated interest and principal payments and the intent and ability to retain the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value and the likelihood of any near-term fair value recovery. If such decline is deemed to be uncollectible, the security is written down to a new cost basis and the resulting loss will be recognized as a securities credit loss expense through an allowance for securities credit losses.\nRisks Related to Loan Sales\nThe Bank may be required to repurchase mortgage loans for a breach of representations and warranties, which could harm the Company\u2019s earnings. The Company enters into loan sale agreements with investors in the normal course of business. The loan sale agreements generally require the repurchase of certain loans previously sold in the event of a violation of various representations and warranties customary in the mortgage banking industry. FNMA, FHLMC and investors carefully examine loan documentation on delinquent loans for a possible reason to request a repurchase by the loan originator. A subsequent sale of a repurchased mortgage loan could be at a significant discount to the unpaid principal balance. The Company maintains a reserve for repurchased loans. However, if repurchase activity or the amount of loss on the sale of a repurchased loan is greater than anticipated, the reserve may need to be increased to cover actual losses, which could harm future earnings.\nRisks Related to Laws and Regulations\nThe Company and the Bank operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations. The Company is subject to examination, supervision and regulation by the FRB. The Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the OCC, its primary federal regulator, by the FDIC, as insurer of deposits, and by the CFPB with respect to consumer protection laws. Such regulation and supervision governs the activities in which an institution and its holding company may engage. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on operations, the classification of assets and determination of the level of the allowance for credit losses. The laws and regulations that govern the Company\u2019s and the Bank\u2019s operations are designed for the protection of depositors and the public, but not the Company\u2019s stockholders. These provisions, as well as any other aspects of current or future regulatory or legislative changes to laws applicable to the financial industry, may impact the profitability of the Company\u2019s business activities and may change certain business practices, including the ability to offer new products, obtain financing, generate fee income, attract deposits, make loans and achieve satisfactory interest spreads, and could expose the Company to additional costs, including increased compliance costs. These changes also may require the Company to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes to operations in order to comply, and could therefore also materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act directed the FRB to issue rules to limit debit-card interchange fees, (the fees that issuing banks charge merchants each time a consumer uses a debit card) collected by banks with assets of $10 billion or more. Under the temporary relief provisions of a joint rule published by the OCC, the FDIC, and the FRB, the Bank received relief from Dodd-Frank limitations on debit card interchange fees collected by banks with assets of $10 billion or more. At December 31, 2021, the Bank was exempt from this rule but will be subject to reduced interchange fees beginning in July 2022. In addition, market forces may result in reduced fees charged by all issuers, regardless of asset size, which may result in reduced revenues for the Bank. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Bank\u2019s revenues from interchange fees were $12.7 million, an increase of $1.8 million from 2020. See Regulation and Supervision, General, The Dodd-Frank Act.\nAs part of its lending activity, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps that allow commercial loan customers to effectively convert a variable-rate commercial loan agreement to a fixed-rate commercial loan agreement. Under these agreements, the Company enters into a variable-rate loan agreement with a customer in addition to an interest rate swap agreement, which serves to effectively swap the customer\u2019s variable-rate loan into a fixed-rate loan. The Company then enters into a corresponding swap agreement with a third party in order to economically hedge its exposure through the customer agreement. Offering these products can subject the Company to additional regulatory oversight and cost, as well as additional risk. The Dodd-Frank Act contains a comprehensive framework for over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) derivatives transactions. Even though many of the requirements do not impact the Company directly, since the Bank does not meet the definition of swap dealer or \u201cmajor swap participant,\u201d the Company continues to review and evaluate the extent to which such requirements impact its business indirectly. A rule issued by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d) sets the permanent aggregate gross notional amount threshold for the de minimis exception from the definition of swap dealer at $8.0 billion in swap dealing activity entered into by a person over the preceding 12 months. The Bank\u2019s swap dealing activities are currently below this threshold.\nThe USA Patriot and Bank Secrecy Acts require financial institutions to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering, terrorist financing and other illicit activities. If such activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury\u2019s Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in wide variety of sanctions, including payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, and restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity and expansion. Although the Bank has developed policies and procedures designated to comply with these laws and regulations, these policies and procedures may not be effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations.\nThe Company is subject to stringent capital requirements, which may adversely impact return on equity, require additional capital raises, or limit the ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares. Federal regulations establish minimum capital requirements for insured depository institutions, including minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, and define \u201ccapital\u201d for calculating these ratios. The minimum capital requirements are: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6%; (iii) a total capital ratio of 8%; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. The regulations also establish a \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d of 2.5%, which if complied will result in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 8.5%; and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the capital conservation buffer amount.\nThe application of these capital requirements could, among other things, require the Company to maintain higher capital resulting in lower returns on equity, and require the Company to obtain additional capital to comply or result in regulatory actions if the Company is unable to comply with such requirements. See Regulation and Supervision, Bank Holding Company Regulation.\nMonetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations. The Company\u2019s earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve Board. An important function of the Federal Reserve Board is to regulate the money supply and credit conditions. Among the instruments used by the Federal Reserve Board to implement these objectives are open market purchases and sales of U.S. government securities, adjustments of the discount rate and changes in banks\u2019 reserve requirements against certain transaction account deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.\nThe monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board have a significant effect on the operating results of financial institutions. However, the extent of such policies upon the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations cannot be predicted.\nThe Company is subject to the CRA and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to material penalties. The CRA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. A successful regulatory challenge to an institution\u2019s performance under the CRA or fair lending laws and regulations could result in sanctions, including payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, and restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity and expansion. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Such actions could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Federal Reserve Board may require the Company to commit capital resources to support the Bank. Federal law requires that a holding company act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support such subsidiary bank. Under the \u201csource of strength\u201d doctrine, the Federal Reserve Board may require a holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to a subsidiary bank. A capital injection may be required at times when the holding company may not have the resources to provide it and therefore may require the holding company to borrow the funds or raise capital. Thus, any borrowing or funds needed to raise capital required to make a capital injection becomes more difficult and expensive and could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to heightened regulatory requirements as a result of total assets exceeding $10 billion. The Company\u2019s total assets were $11.7 billion at December 31, 2021 and banks or financial institutions with assets in excess of $10 billion are subject to requirements imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations, including: the examination authority of the CFPB to assess compliance with federal consumer financial laws, imposition of higher FDIC premiums, reduced debit card interchange fees, and enhanced risk management frameworks, all of which increase operating costs and reduce earnings.\nAdditional costs have been and will be incurred to implement processes, procedures, and monitoring of compliance with these imposed requirements, including investing significant management attention and resources to make the necessary changes to comply with the requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act. The Company faces the risk of failing to meet these requirements, which could result in regulatory action. While the effect of any presently contemplated or future changes in the laws or regulations or their interpretations would have is unpredictable, these changes could be materially adverse to the Company\u2019s investors.\nFurthermore, the level of dividends the Bank receives from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia is reduced for financial institutions that exceed a certain asset size. The asset size was originally established at $10 billion, but has been increased for inflation such that, for 2021, the asset level is $10.79 billion. Financial institutions whose assets exceed that level receive dividends generally equal to the rate of the 10-year Treasury note, as opposed to 6% for smaller financial institutions. Such reduction has significantly decreased the dividends received from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, which totaled $591,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nRisks Related to Dividend Payments\nThere is no guaranty that the Company will be able to continue to pay a dividend on its common stock or, if continued, will be able to pay a dividend at the current rate. The Board of Directors of the Company determines if, when and the amount of dividends that may be paid on the common stock. In making such determination under the Company\u2019s capital management plan, the Board of Directors takes into account various factors including economic conditions, earnings, liquidity needs, the financial condition of the Company, applicable state law, regulatory requirements and other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors. Although the Company has a history of paying a quarterly dividend on its common stock, there is no guaranty that such dividends will continue to be paid in the future or at what rate.\nDividends on the Series A Preferred Stock are discretionary and non-cumulative. Dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock are discretionary and will not be cumulative. If the Board of Directors does not declare a dividend on the Series A Preferred Stock in respect of a dividend period, then no dividend will be payable on the applicable dividend payment date, no dividend will be deemed to have accumulated for such dividend period, and the Company will have no obligation to pay any dividend for that dividend period at any time, whether or not the Board of Directors declares a dividend on the Series A Preferred Stock or any other class or series of the Company\u2019s capital stock for any future dividend period. Any declaration and payment of dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock will depend upon, among other factors, the Company\u2019s earnings and financial condition, liquidity and capital requirements, the general economic and regulatory climate, the ability to service any equity or debt obligations senior to the Series A Preferred Stock, and other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors. In addition, under the Federal Reserve\u2019s capital rules, dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock may only be paid out of net income, retained earnings, or surplus related to other additional Tier 1 capital instruments.\nRisks Related to Competition\nCompetition may adversely affect profitability and liquidity. The Company has substantial competition in originating commercial and consumer loans in its market area. This competition comes principally from other banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking companies and other lenders. Many of these competitors enjoy advantages, including greater financial resources and access to capital, stronger regulatory ratios and higher lending limits, a wider geographic presence, more accessible branch office locations, the ability to offer a wider array of services or more favorable pricing alternatives, as well as lower origination and operating costs. In addition, rapid technological changes and consumer preferences may result in\nincreased competition for the Bank\u2019s services. Increased competition could reduce the Company\u2019s net income by decreasing the number and size of loans that the Bank originates and the interest rates charged on these loans. Competitive factors driven by consumer sentiment or otherwise can also reduce the Company\u2019s ability to generate fee income, such as through overdraft fees.\nIn attracting deposits, the Company faces substantial competition from other insured depository institutions such as banks, savings institutions and credit unions, as well as institutions offering uninsured investment alternatives, including money market funds. Many competitors enjoy advantages, including greater financial resources and access to capital, stronger regulatory ratios, more aggressive marketing campaigns, better brand recognition and more branch locations. These competitors may offer higher interest rates than the Company, which could decrease the deposits that the Company attracts or require the Company to increase its rates to retain existing deposits or attract new deposits. Increased deposit competition could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to generate the funds necessary for lending operations. As a result, the Company may need to seek other sources of funds that may be more expensive to obtain which could increase the cost of funds.\nIn addition, rapid technological changes and consumer preferences may result in increased competition for the Company\u2019s other services. A number of well-funded technology focused companies are innovating the payments, distributed ledger, and cryptocurrency networks and are attempting to disintermediate portions of the traditional banking model. A shift in the mix of payment forms away from the Company\u2019s products and services could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial position and results of operations.\nThe Company has also been active in competing for New Jersey governmental and municipal deposits. At December 31, 2021, these relationships included public school districts, local municipal governments, and cooperative health insurance funds, and such deposits accounted for approximately 27.9% of the Company\u2019s total deposits. The governor of New Jersey has proposed that the state form and own a bank in which governmental and municipal entities may deposit their excess funds, with the state owned bank then financing small businesses and municipal projects in New Jersey. Should this proposal be adopted and a state owned bank formed, it could impede the Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain governmental and municipal deposits and financing opportunities. Public fund deposits from local government entities such as counties, townships, school districts and other municipalities generally have higher average balances and the Bank\u2019s inability to retain such funds could adversely affect liquidity or result in the use of higher-cost funding sources.\nRisks Related to Strategic Matters\nNew lines of business or new products and services may subject the Company to additional risks. The Company may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services significant time and resources may be invested. Initial timetables for the development and introduction of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. Furthermore, if customers do not perceive new offerings as providing significant value, they may fail to accept the new products and services. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. Furthermore, the burden on management and information technology of introducing any new line of business and/or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s inability to tailor its retail delivery model to respond to consumer preferences in banking may negatively affect earnings. The Bank has expanded its market presence through acquisitions and growth in lending teams. The branch continues to be a very significant source of new business generation, however, consumers continue to migrate much of their routine banking to self-service channels. In recognition of this shift in consumer patterns, the Bank has undertaken a comprehensive review of its branch network, resulting in branch consolidation accompanied by the enhancement of the Bank\u2019s capabilities to serve its customers through alternate delivery channels. The benefits of this strategy are dependent on the Bank\u2019s ability to realize expected expense reductions without experiencing significant customer attrition.\nRisks Related to Operational Matters\nRisks associated with system failures, interruptions, or breaches of security could disrupt businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage the reputation of, and create significant financial and legal exposure for the Company. Information technology systems are critical to the Company\u2019s business. The business is required to collect, process, transmit and store significant amounts of confidential information regarding the Company\u2019s customers, employees and its own business, operations, plans and business strategies. The Company uses various technology systems to manage customer relationships, deposits and loans, general ledger, securities investments, and other processes. The computer systems, data management and internal processes, as well as those of third parties, are integral to the Company\u2019s performance. The operational risks include the risk of malfeasance by employees or persons outside the Company, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, systems failures or interruptions, failures to properly implement systems upgrades, breaches of the Company\u2019s internal control systems and compliance requirements, and business continuation and disaster recovery.\nFinancial institutions and companies have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other damage, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyberattacks, ransomware and other means. Additionally, there is the risk of distributed denial-of-service or other similar attacks from technically sophisticated and well-resourced third parties, which are intended to disrupt online services. Despite the Company\u2019s efforts to ensure the integrity of its systems, the Company may not be able to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches, especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources. Those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of the Company\u2019s systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to the Company\u2019s data or that of its customers or clients. These risks may increase in the future as the Company continues to increase its mobile and other internet-based product offerings and systems.\nIn addition, a majority of data processing is outsourced to certain third-party providers. If these third-party providers encounter difficulties, or if there is difficulty communicating with them, the ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and business operations could be adversely affected. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various vendors and their personnel. Breaches of security may occur through intentional or unintentional acts by those having authorized or unauthorized access to the confidential or other information of the Company and its customers, clients or counterparties. While management regularly reviews security assessments that were conducted on the Company\u2019s third-party service providers that have access to sensitive and confidential information, there can be no assurance that their information security protocols are sufficient to withstand a cyber-attack or other security breach.\nThe occurrence of any system failures, interruption, or breach of security of the Company\u2019s or its vendors\u2019 systems could cause serious negative consequences for the Company, including significant disruption of the Company\u2019s operations, misappropriation of confidential information of the Company or that of its customers, or damage to computers or systems of the Company and those of its customers and counterparties, and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to the Company or to its customers, loss of confidence in the Company\u2019s security measures, customer dissatisfaction, significant litigation exposure, and harm to the Company\u2019s reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nAn inability to attract and retain qualified personnel or the unexpected loss of service of any key personnel could have a negative impact on financial condition and results of operations. The Company\u2019s ability to maximize profitability and manage growth successfully will depend on its ability to continue to attract and retain management and loan officers experienced in banking and financial services and familiar with the communities in its market area. The unexpected loss of service of any key management personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could adversely affect the Company. If the Company is not able to attract qualified personnel it could negatively impact the Company\u2019s profitability and growth.\nRisks Related to Accounting and Internal Controls Matters\nThe Company may incur impairments to goodwill. At December 31, 2021, the Company had $500.3 million in goodwill which is evaluated for impairment, at least annually. Significant negative industry or economic trends, including declines in the market price of the Company\u2019s stock, reduced estimates of future cash flows or business disruptions could result in impairments to goodwill. The valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely on projections of future operating performance. If the analysis results in impairment to goodwill, an impairment charge to earnings would be recorded in the financial statements during the period in which such impairment is determined to exist. Any such charge could have an adverse effect on the results of operations.\nControls and procedures may fail or be circumvented, which, if not remediated appropriately or timely, could result in loss of investor confidence and adversely impact the Company\u2019s stock price. Management routinely reviews and updates internal controls. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide\nonly reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of the controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the Company, the results of operations and financial condition, investor confidence, and stock price.\nChanges in management\u2019s estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and the financial condition or operating results. In preparing periodic reports, the Company is required to file under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including the consolidated financial statements, management is and will be required under applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of a specified date. These estimates and assumptions are based on management\u2019s best estimates and experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. Materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known, including the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses.\nChanges in accounting standards could affect reported earnings. The bodies responsible for establishing accounting standards, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d), the SEC and other regulatory bodies, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting guidance that governs the preparation of the Company\u2019s financial statements. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how the financial condition and results of operations are reported. In some cases, the Company could be required to apply new or revised guidance retroactively.\nRisks Related to Environmental and Other Global Matters\nHurricanes and other natural disasters, climate change or increases to flood insurance premiums could adversely affect asset quality and earnings. The Bank\u2019s trade area includes counties in New Jersey with extensive coastal regions. These areas may be vulnerable to flooding or other damage from future storms or hurricanes, which could negatively impact the Company\u2019s results of operations by disrupting operations, adversely impacting the ability of the Company\u2019s borrowers to repay their loans, damaging collateral or reducing the value of real estate used as collateral.\nThe Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected by natural disasters, health epidemics, and other catastrophic events. The Company could be adversely affected if key personnel or a significant number of employees were to become unavailable due to a pandemic disease, natural disaster, war, act of terrorism, accident, or other reason. Any of these events could result in the temporary reduction of operations, employees, and customers which could limit the Company\u2019s ability to provide services.\nFurther, given the inter-connectivity of the global economy, pandemic disease and health events have the potential to negatively impact economic activities in many countries, including the United States, including the business of the Bank\u2019s borrowers. Additionally, global markets may be adversely affected by the emergence of widespread health emergencies or pandemics.\nSocietal responses to climate change could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and performance, including indirectly through impacts on its customers. Concerns over the long-term impacts of climate change have led and will continue to lead to governmental efforts around the world to mitigate those impacts. Consumers and businesses also may change their behavior on their own as a result of these concerns. The Company and its customers will need to respond to new laws and regulations as well as consumer and business preferences resulting from climate change concerns. The Company and its customers may face cost increases, asset value reductions, operating process changes, and other issues. The impact on the Company\u2019s customers will likely vary depending on their specific attributes, including reliance on or role in carbon intensive activities. Among the impacts could be a drop in demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, particularly in certain sectors. In addition, the Company could face reductions in creditworthiness on the part of some customers or in the value of assets securing loans. The Company takes these risks into account when making lending and other decisions, such as business with climate-friendly companies, which may not be effective in protecting from the negative impact of new laws and regulations or changes in consumer or business behavior.\nRisks Related to Card Networks\nChanges in card network fees could impact the Company\u2019s operations. From time to time, the card networks increase the fees (known as interchange fees) that they charge to acquirers and that the Bank charges its merchants. It is possible that competitive pressures will result in the Bank absorbing a portion of such increases in the future, which would increase costs, reduce profit margin and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and financial condition. In addition, the card networks require certain capital requirements. An increase in the required capital level would further limit the Company\u2019s use of capital for other purposes.\nChanges in card network rules or standards could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business. The Company is a member of the Visa and MasterCard networks. As such, the Company is subject to card network rules resulting in a variety of fines or\npenalties that may be assessed on the Company. The termination of membership or any changes in card network rules or standards, including interpretation and implementation of existing rules or standards, could increase the cost of operating merchant servicer business or limit the ability to provide debit card and cash management solutions to or through customers, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOther Risks Related to the Business\nElimination of LIBOR and uncertainty of its replacement may adversely affect the Company. In 2017, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d) was created to identify an alternative reference interest rate to replace LIBOR. The ARRC announced Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by Treasury securities, as its preferred alternative to LIBOR. The Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced its intention to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after June 2023. Whether or not SOFR attains market traction as a LIBOR replacement tool remains in question. There are risks inherent with the transition to any alternative rate as the rate may behave differently than LIBOR in reaction to monetary, market and economic events. The discontinuance of LIBOR may adversely affect the value of and return on the Company\u2019s financial assets and liabilities that are based on or are linked to LIBOR, the Company\u2019s results of operations or financial condition. In addition, these reforms may require changes to existing contracts that govern LIBOR based products as well as the Company\u2019s systems and processes.", "PERMNO": 83774, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "OCFC"}
