Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks. Any of these risk factors, either individually or in combination, could have significant adverse impacts to our results of operations and financial condition, or prevent us from meeting our profitability or growth objectives.\nRisks Related to the Worldwide Oil and Natural Gas Industry\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from customers in the worldwide oil and natural gas industry; therefore, our risk factors include those factors that impact the demand for oil and natural gas. Spending by our customers for exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas is based on a number of factors, including expectations of future hydrocarbon demand, energy prices, the risks associated with developing reserves, our customer\u2019s ability to finance exploration and development of reserves, and the future value of the reserves. Reductions in customer spending levels have adversely affected the demand for our services, and consequently, our revenue and operating results and a continuation of these market conditions will continue to negatively affect our revenue and operating results. The key risk factors that we believe influence the worldwide oil and natural gas markets are discussed below.\nDemand for oil and natural gas is subject to factors beyond our control\nDemand for oil and natural gas, as well as the demand for our services, is highly correlated with global economic growth and in particular by the economic growth of countries such as the U.S., India, China, and developing countries in Asia and the Middle East. Weakness in global economic activity has reduced and incremental weakness could continue to reduce demand for oil and natural gas and result in lower oil and natural gas prices. In addition, demand for oil and natural gas could be impacted by environmental regulation, including cap and trade legislation, regulation of hydraulic fracturing, and carbon taxes. Weakness or deterioration of the global economy or credit markets could reduce our customers\u2019 spending levels and reduce our revenue and operating results.\nSupply of oil and natural gas is subject to factors beyond our control\nThe ability to produce oil and natural gas can be affected by the number and productivity of new wells drilled and completed, as well as the rate of production and resulting depletion of existing wells. Productive capacity in excess of demand is also an important factor influencing energy prices and spending by oil and natural gas exploration companies. Oil and natural gas storage inventory levels are indicators of the relative balance between supply and demand. Supply can also be impacted by the degree to which individual Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) nations and other large oil and natural gas producing countries are willing and able to control production and exports of hydrocarbons, to decrease or increase supply and to support their targeted oil price or meet market share objectives. Any of these factors could affect the supply of oil and natural gas and could have a material effect on our results of operations.\nVolatility of oil and natural gas prices can adversely affect demand for our products and services\nVolatility in oil and natural gas prices can also impact our customers\u2019 activity levels and spending for our products and services. The level of energy prices is important to the cash flow for our customers and their ability to fund exploration and development activities. Since late 2014, oil prices have declined significantly due in large part to increasing supplies, weakening demand growth and OPEC\u2019s position to not cut production. Expectations about future commodity prices and price volatility are important for determining future spending levels.\nLower oil and natural gas prices generally lead to decreased spending by our customers. Our customers also take into account the volatility of energy prices and other risk factors by requiring higher returns for individual projects if there is higher perceived risk.\nOur customers\u2019 activity levels, spending for our products and services and ability to pay amounts owed us could be impacted by the ability of our customers to access equity or credit markets\nOur customers\u2019 access to capital is dependent on their ability to access the funds necessary to develop oil and gas prospects. Limited access to external sources of funding has and may continue to cause customers to reduce their capital spending plans. In addition, a reduction of cash flow to our customers resulting from declines in commodity prices or the lack of available debt or equity financing may impact the ability of our customers to pay amounts owed to us.\nRisks Related to our Customer Concentration and reliance on the U.S. Exploration and Production Market\nIn 2015, approximately 49% of our consolidated revenues were derived from our 20 largest customers, although no single customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues. In addition, approximately 57% of our consolidated revenues were derived from our U.S. operations.\nBeginning in the fourth quarter of 2014 and continuing through 2015 into early 2016, the price for oil has declined dramatically from the price levels in recent years and there are no assurances that the price for oil will not continue to decline. Following this decline, North American drilling activity has decreased significantly, which has reduced the demand for our services and negatively impacted customer pricing in our North American operations. Due to these changes, our quarterly and annual operating results have been negatively impacted and may continue to fluctuate in future periods. Because our business has high fixed costs, including significant facility and personnel expenses, downtime or low productivity due to reduced demand can have a significant adverse impact on our profitability.\nRisks Related to the Cost and Continued Availability of Borrowed Funds, including Risks of Noncompliance with Debt Covenants\nWe employ borrowed funds as an integral part of our long-term capital structure and our future success is dependent upon continued access to borrowed funds to support our operations. The availability of borrowed funds on reasonable terms is dependent on the condition of credit markets and financial institutions from which these funds are obtained. Adverse events in the financial markets may significantly reduce the availability of funds, which may have an adverse effect on our cost of borrowings and our ability to fund our business strategy.\nOur ability to meet our debt service requirements and the continued availability of funds under our existing or future credit agreements is dependent upon our ability to continue generating operating income and remain in compliance with the covenants in our credit agreements. In December 2015, we entered into a First Amendment to our Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (\u201cAmendment\u201d), amending provisions of our existing Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (\u201cCredit Agreement\u201d). The Amendment was principally entered into as a result of our anticipation of non-compliance with the consolidated leverage ratio financial covenant under our Credit Agreement. While no amounts are currently outstanding under our Credit Agreement, a breach of any of these covenants would result in a default under the Credit Agreement unless we are able to obtain, on a timely basis, the necessary waiver or amendment to the Credit Agreement. Any waiver or amendment to our Credit Agreement may require us to revise the terms of our Credit Agreement which could increase the cost of our borrowings, require the payment of additional fees, and adversely impact the results of our operations. Upon the occurrence of any event of default under the Credit Agreement that is not waived, the lenders could elect to exercise any of their available remedies, which include the right to not lend any additional amounts or, in the event we have outstanding indebtedness under the Credit Agreement, to declare any outstanding indebtedness, together with any accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. If we are unable to repay the outstanding indebtedness, if any, under the Credit Agreement when due, the lenders would be permitted to proceed against their collateral. In the event any outstanding indebtedness in excess of $25 million is accelerated, this could also cause a default under our unsecured convertible senior notes. The acceleration of any of our indebtedness and the election to exercise any such remedies could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nRisks Related to International Operations\nWe have significant operations outside of the United States, including certain areas of Canada, EMEA, Latin America, and Asia Pacific. In 2015, these international operations generated approximately 43% of our consolidated revenues. In addition, we may seek to expand to other areas outside the United States in the future. International operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u25a0\ndifficulties and cost associated with complying with a wide variety of complex foreign laws, treaties and regulations\n\u25a0\nuncertainties in or unexpected changes in regulatory environments or tax laws\n\u25a0\nlegal uncertainties, timing delays and expenses associated with tariffs, export licenses and other trade barriers\n\u25a0\ndifficulties enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems\n\u25a0\nrisks associated with failing to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, export laws, and other similar U.S. laws applicable to our operations in international markets\n\u25a0\nexchange controls or other limitations on international currency movements\n\u25a0\nsanctions imposed by the U.S. government that prevent us from engaging in business in certain countries\n\u25a0\ninability to obtain or preserve certain intellectual property rights in the foreign countries in which we operate\n\u25a0\nour inexperience in new international markets\n\u25a0\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates\n\u25a0\npolitical and economic instability\n\u25a0\nacts of terrorism\nIn addition, several North African markets in which we operate, including Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, and Algeria have experienced social and political unrest in past years, which negatively impacted our operating results, including the temporary suspension of our operations. More recently in Brazil, a widely-publicized corruption investigation has led to disruptions in Petrobras\u2019 operations.\nRisks Related to Operating Hazards Present in the Oil and Natural Gas Industry\nOur operations are subject to hazards present in the oil and natural gas industry, such as fire, explosion, blowouts, oil spills and leaks or spills of hazardous materials (both onshore and offshore). These incidents as well as accidents or problems in normal operations can cause personal injury or death and damage to property or the environment. The customer\u2019s operations can also be interrupted and it is possible that such incidents can interrupt our ongoing operations and the ability to provide our services. From time to time, customers seek recovery for damage to their equipment or property that occurred during the course of our service obligations. Damage to the customer\u2019s property and any related spills of hazardous materials could be extensive if a major problem occurred. We purchase insurance which may provide coverage for incidents such as those described above, however, the policies may not provide coverage or a sufficient amount of coverage for all types of damage claims that could be asserted against us. See the section entitled \u201cRisks Related to the Inherent Limitations of Insurance Coverage\u201d for additional information.\nRisks Related to Business Acquisitions and Capital Investments\nOur ability to successfully execute our business strategy will depend, among other things, on our ability to make capital investments and acquisitions which provide us with financial benefits. In 2016, our capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $30 million to $45 million, including additional investments for the facility upgrade and expansion of our Fourchon, Louisiana facility serving the Gulf of Mexico deepwater market, as well as infrastructure investments required to support the expansion of our international operations. These investments are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u25a0\nincorrect assumptions regarding business activity levels or results from our capital investments, acquired operations or assets\n\u25a0\nfailure to complete a planned acquisition transaction or to successfully integrate the operations or management of any acquired businesses or assets in a timely manner\n\u25a0\ndiversion of management's attention from existing operations or other priorities\n\u25a0\nunanticipated disruptions to our business associated with the implementation of our enterprise-wide operational and financial system\n\u25a0\ndelays in completion and cost overruns associated with large construction projects, including the project mentioned above\nAny of the factors above could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Availability of Raw Materials and Skilled Personnel\nOur ability to provide products and services to our customers is dependent upon our ability to obtain the raw materials and qualified personnel necessary to operate our business.\nBarite is a naturally occurring mineral that constitutes a significant portion of our drilling fluids systems. We currently secure the majority of our barite ore from foreign sources, primarily China and India. The availability and cost of barite ore is dependent on factors beyond our control including transportation, political priorities and government imposed export fees in the exporting countries, as well as the impact of weather and natural disasters. The future supply of barite ore from existing sources could be inadequate to meet the market demand, particularly during periods of increasing world-wide demand, which could ultimately result in a reduction in industry activity, or our inability to meet customer\u2019s needs.\nOur mats business is highly dependent on the availability of high-density polyethylene (\u201cHDPE\u201d), which is the primary raw material used in the manufacture of the DURA-BASE mat. The cost of HDPE can vary significantly based on the energy costs of the producers of HDPE, demand for this material, and the capacity/operations of the plants used to make HDPE. Should our cost of HDPE increase, we may not be able to increase our customer pricing to cover our costs, which may result in a reduction in future profitability.\nAll of our businesses are also highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly-skilled engineers, technical sales and service personnel. The market for these employees is very competitive, and if we cannot attract and retain quality personnel, our ability to compete effectively and to grow our business will be severely limited. Also, a significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction in our skilled labor force or an increase in our operating costs.\nRisk Related to our Market Competition\nWe face competition in the Fluids Systems business from larger companies, which compete vigorously on fluids performance and/or price. In addition, these companies have broad product and service offerings in addition to their drilling fluids. At times, these larger companies attempt to compete by offering discounts to customers to use multiple products and services from our competitor, some of which we do not offer. We also have smaller regional competitors competing with us mainly on price and local relationships. Our competition in the Mats and Integrated Services business is fragmented, with many competitors providing various forms of mat products and services. More recently several competitors have begun marketing composite products to compete with our DURA-BASE mat system. While we believe the design and manufacture of our mat products provide a differentiated value to our customers, many of our competitors seek to compete on pricing. Further, the current weakness in the North American drilling activity has resulted in significant reductions in pricing from many of our competitors, both in the Fluids Systems and Mats and Integrated Services segment.\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters, Including Environmental Regulations\nWe are responsible for complying with numerous federal, state and local laws, regulations and policies that govern environmental protection, zoning and other matters applicable to our current and past business activities, including the activities of our former subsidiaries. Failure to remain compliant with these laws and regulations may result in fines, penalties, costs of cleanup of contaminated sites and site closure obligations, or other expenditures. Further, any changes in the current legal and regulatory environment could impact industry activity and the demands for our products and services, the scope of products and services that we provide, or our cost structure required to provide our products and services, or the costs incurred by our customers.\nThe markets for our products and services are dependent on the continued exploration for and production of fossil fuels (predominantly oil and natural gas). Climate change is receiving increased attention worldwide. Many scientists, legislators and others attribute climate change to increased levels of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The Environmental Protection Agency (the \u201cEPA\u201d) has adopted regulations that potentially limit greenhouse gas emissions and impose reporting obligations on large greenhouse gas emission sources. In addition, the EPA has adopted rules that could require the reduction of certain air emissions during exploration and production of oil and gas. To the extent that laws and regulations enacted as part of climate change legislation increase the costs of drilling for or producing such fossil fuels, or reduce the demand for fossil fuels, such legislation could have a material adverse impact on our operations and profitability.\nHydraulic fracturing is an increasingly common practice used by E&P operators to stimulate production of hydrocarbons, particularly from shale oil and gas formations in the United States. The process of hydraulic fracturing, which involves the injection of sand (or other forms of proppants) laden fluids into oil and gas bearing zones, has come under increasing scrutiny from a variety of regulatory agencies, including the EPA and various state authorities. Several states have adopted regulations requiring operators to identify the chemicals used in fracturing operations, others have adopted moratoriums on the use of fracturing, and the State of New York has banned the practice altogether. The EPA has commenced a study of the potential impact of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water including the disposal of waste fluid by underground injection. Further, the EPA has announced plans to develop effluent limitations associated with wastewater generated by hydraulic fracturing. Although we do not provide hydraulic fracturing services and our drilling fluids products are not used in such services, regulations which have the effect of limiting the use or availability of hydraulic fracturing could have a significant negative impact on the drilling activity levels of our customers, and, therefore, the demand for our products and services.\nRisks Related to the Inherent Limitations of Insurance Coverage\nWhile we maintain liability insurance, this insurance is subject to coverage limitations. Specific risks and limitations of our insurance coverage include the following:\n\u25a0\nself-insured retention limits on each claim, which are our responsibility\n\u25a0\nexclusions for certain types of liabilities and limitations on coverage for damages resulting from pollution\n\u25a0\ncoverage limits of the policies, and the risk that claims will exceed policy limits\n\u25a0\nthe financial strength and ability of our insurance carriers to meet their obligations under the policies\nIn addition, our ability to continue to obtain insurance coverage on commercially reasonable terms is dependent upon a variety of factors impacting the insurance industry in general, which are outside our control.\nAny of the issues noted above, including insurance cost increases, uninsured or underinsured claims, or the inability of an insurance carrier to meet their financial obligations could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.\nRisks Related to Potential Impairments of Long-lived Intangible Assets\nAs of December 31, 2015, our consolidated balance sheet includes $19.0 million in goodwill related to our Mats and Integrated Services segment and $11.1 million of intangible assets, net. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently as the circumstances require, using a combination of market multiple and discounted cash flow approaches. In completing this annual evaluation during the fourth quarter of 2015, we determined that our drilling fluids reporting unit had a fair value below its net carrying value, and an impairment of $70.7 million was recognized, to fully impair the goodwill related to the drilling fluids reporting unit. In early 2016, oil and natural gas prices and U.S. drilling activity remain significantly below the levels of recent years. Continued softening in the market conditions may further deteriorate the financial performance or future projections for our operating segments from current levels, which may result in an impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets and negatively impact our financial results in the period of impairment.\nRisks Related to Technological Developments in our Industry\nThe market for our products and services is characterized by continual technological developments that generate substantial improvements in product functions and performance. If we are not successful in continuing to develop product enhancements or new products that are accepted in the marketplace or that comply with industry standards, we could lose market share to competitors, which would negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe hold U.S. and foreign patents for certain of our drilling fluids components and our mat systems. However, these patents are not a guarantee that we will have a meaningful advantage over our competitors, and there is a risk that others may develop systems that are substantially equivalent to those covered by our patents. If that were to happen, we would face increased competition from both a service and a pricing standpoint. In addition, costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our patents and proprietary rights. It is possible that future innovation could change the way companies drill for oil and gas which could reduce the competitive advantages we may derive from our patents and other proprietary technology.\nRisks Related to Cybersecurity Breaches or Business System Disruptions\nWe utilize various management information systems and information technology infrastructure to manage or support a variety of our business operations, and to maintain various records, which may include confidential business or proprietary information as well as information regarding our customers, business partners, employees or other third parties. Failures of or interference with access to these systems, such as communication disruptions, could have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct operations or directly impact consolidated financial reporting. Security breaches pose a risk to confidential data and intellectual property which could result in damages to our competitiveness and reputation. The company has policies and procedures in place, including system monitoring and data back-up processes, to prevent or mitigate the effects of these potential disruptions or breaches, however there can be no assurance that existing or emerging threats will not have an adverse impact on our systems or communications networks. These risks could harm our reputation and our relationships with our customers, business partners, employees or other third parties, and may result in claims against us. In addition, these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.\nRisks Related to Severe Weather, Particularly in the U.S. Gulf Coast\nApproximately 12% of our consolidated revenue from continuing operations in 2015 was generated in market areas in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and related near-shore areas, which are susceptible to hurricanes and other adverse weather events. These weather events can disrupt our operations and result in damage to our properties, as well as negatively impact the activity and financial condition of our customers. Our business may be adversely affected by these and other negative effects of future hurricanes or other adverse weather events in regions in which we operate.\nRisks Related to Fluctuations in the Market Value of our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate due to a number of factors, including the general economy, stock market conditions, general trends in the E&P industry, announcements made by us or our competitors, and variations in our operating results. Investors may not be able to predict the timing or extent of these fluctuations.", "PERMNO": 34673, "SIC": 5160, "TIC": "NR"}
