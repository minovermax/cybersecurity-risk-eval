RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in the Corporation\u2019s common stock is subject to risks inherent to the Corporation\u2019s business. The material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect the Corporation are described below. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the Corporation. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair the Corporation\u2019s business operations. This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.\nIf any of the following risks actually occur, the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the market price of the Corporation\u2019s common stock could decline significantly, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related To The Corporation\u2019s Business\nThe Corporation\u2019s Business May Be Adversely Affected By Conditions In The Financial Markets and Economic Conditions Generally\nIn recent years, economic growth and business activity across a wide range of industries and regions in the U.S. has been slow and uneven. Furthermore, there are continuing concerns related to the level of U.S. government debt and fiscal actions that may be taken to address that debt. There can be no assurance that economic conditions will continue to improve, and these conditions could worsen. In addition, declining oil prices, on-going federal budget negotiations, the implementation of the employer mandate under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the level of U.S. debt may have a destabilizing effect on financial markets.\nThe Corporation\u2019s financial performance generally, and in particular the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans, as well as demand for loans and other products and services the Corporation offers, is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where the Corporation operates, in the State of Texas and in the United States as a whole. A favorable business environment is generally characterized by, among other factors, economic growth, efficient capital markets, low inflation, low unemployment, high business and investor confidence, and strong business earnings. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital; increases in inflation or interest rates; high unemployment, natural disasters; or a combination of these or other factors.\nOverall, during recent years, the business environment has been adverse for many households and businesses in the United States and worldwide. While economic conditions in the State of Texas, the United States and worldwide have shown signs of improvement, there can be no assurance that this improvement will continue. Economic pressure on consumers and uncertainty regarding continuing economic improvement may result in changes in consumer and business spending, borrowing and savings habits. Such conditions could have a material adverse effect on the credit quality of the Corporation\u2019s loans and the Corporation\u2019 business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Corporation Is Subject To Lending Risk\nThere are inherent risks associated with the Corporation\u2019s lending activities. These risks include, among other things, the impact of changes in interest rates and changes in the economic conditions in the markets where the Corporation operates as well as those across the State of Texas and the United States. Increases in interest rates and/or weakening economic conditions could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans or the value of the collateral securing these loans. The Corporation is also subject to various laws and regulations that affect its lending activities. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject the Corporation to regulatory enforcement action that could result in the assessment of significant civil money penalties against the Corporation.\nAs of December 31, 2014, approximately 88.9% of the Corporation\u2019s loan portfolio consisted of commercial and industrial, construction and commercial real estate mortgage loans. These types of loans are generally viewed as having more risk of default than residential real estate loans or consumer loans. These types of loans are also typically larger than residential real estate loans and consumer loans. Because the Corporation\u2019s loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial and industrial, construction and commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances, the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in non-performing loans. An increase in\nnon-performing loans could result in a net loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the provision for loan losses and an increase in loan charge-offs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSee the section captioned \u201cLoans\u201d in Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations located elsewhere in this report for further discussion related to commercial and industrial, construction and commercial real estate loans.\nThe Corporation Is Subject To Interest Rate Risk\nThe Corporation\u2019s earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon its net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the Corporation\u2019s control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Federal Open Market Committee. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest the Corporation receives on loans and securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect (i) the Corporation\u2019s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, (ii) the fair value of the Corporation\u2019s financial assets and liabilities, and (iii) the average duration of the Corporation\u2019s mortgage-backed securities portfolio. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, the Corporation\u2019s net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. Any substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSee the section captioned \u201cNet Interest Income\u201d in Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations located elsewhere in this report for further discussion related to the Corporation\u2019s management of interest rate risk.\nThe Corporation\u2019s Allowance For Loan Losses May Be Insufficient\nThe Corporation maintains an allowance for loan losses, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense, which represents management\u2019s best estimate of probable losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans. The allowance, in the judgment of management, is necessary to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio. The level of the allowance reflects management\u2019s continuing evaluation of industry concentrations; specific credit risks; loan loss experience; current loan portfolio quality; present economic, political and regulatory conditions and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires the Corporation to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Continuing deterioration in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of the Corporation\u2019s control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review the Corporation\u2019s allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management. Furthermore, if charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan losses, the Corporation will need additional provisions to increase the allowance for loan losses. Any increases in the allowance for loan losses will result in a decrease in net income and, possibly, capital, and may have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSee the section captioned \u201cAllowance for Loan Losses\u201d in Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations located elsewhere in this report for further discussion related to the Corporation\u2019s process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses.\nThe Corporation\u2019s Profitability Depends Significantly On Economic Conditions In The State Of Texas\nThe Corporation\u2019s success depends primarily on the general economic conditions of the State of Texas and the specific local markets in which the Corporation operates. Unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically diversified, the Corporation provides banking and financial services to customers across Texas through financial centers in the Austin, Corpus Christi, Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston, Permian Basin, Rio Grande Valley and\nSan Antonio regions. The local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on the demand for the Corporation\u2019s products and services as well as the ability of the Corporation\u2019s customers to repay loans, the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of the Corporation\u2019s deposit funding sources. Moreover, approximately 97.4% of the securities in the Corporation\u2019s municipal bond portfolio were issued by political subdivisions or agencies within the State of Texas. A significant decline in general economic conditions in Texas, whether caused by recession, inflation, unemployment, changes in oil prices, changes in securities markets, acts of terrorism, outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic occurrences or other factors could impact these local economic conditions and, in turn, have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Corporation May Be Adversely Affected By Declining Crude Oil Prices\nRecent decisions by certain members the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) to maintain higher crude oil production levels have led to increased global oil supplies which has resulted in significant declines in market oil prices. Decreased market oil prices have compressed margins for many U.S. and Texas-based oil producers, particularly those that utilize higher-cost production technologies such as hydraulic fracking and horizontal drilling, as well as oilfield service providers, energy equipment manufacturers and transportation suppliers, among others. As of December 31, 2014, energy loans comprised approximately 16.1% of the Corporation\u2019s loan portfolio. Furthermore, energy production and related industries represent a large part of the economies in some of the Corporation\u2019s primary markets. As of December 31, 2014, the price per barrel of crude oil was approximately $53 compared to approximately $98 as of December 31, 2013. While many of the Corporation\u2019s customers have hedged their exposure to oil price changes in the near term, if oil prices remain at these low levels for an extended period, the Corporation could experience weaker energy loan demand and increased losses within its energy portfolio. Furthermore, a prolonged period of low oil prices could also have a negative impact on the U.S. economy and, in particular, the economies of energy-dominant states such as Texas. Accordingly, a prolonged period of low oil prices could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Corporation May Be Adversely Affected By The Soundness Of Other Financial Institutions\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. The Corporation has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose the Corporation to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, the Corporation\u2019s credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by the Corporation cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to the Corporation. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Corporation Operates In A Highly Competitive Industry and Market Area\nThe Corporation faces substantial competition in all areas of its operations from a variety of different competitors, many of which are larger and may have more financial resources. Such competitors primarily include national, regional, and community banks within the various markets where the Corporation operates. The Corporation also faces competition from many other types of financial institutions, including, without limitation, savings and loans, credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies and other financial intermediaries. The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Also, technology and other changes have lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks. For example, consumers can maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts or mutual funds. Consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and/or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as \u201cdisintermediation,\u201d could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. Further, many of the Corporation\u2019s competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. Additionally, due to their size, many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than the Corporation can.\nThe Corporation\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nThe ability to develop, maintain and build long-term customer relationships based on top quality service, high ethical standards and safe, sound assets.\n\u2022\nThe ability to expand the Corporation\u2019s market position.\n\u2022\nThe scope, relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands.\n\u2022\nThe rate at which the Corporation introduces new products and services relative to its competitors.\n\u2022\nCustomer satisfaction with the Corporation\u2019s level of service.\n\u2022\nIndustry and general economic trends.\nFailure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken the Corporation\u2019s competitive position, which could adversely affect the Corporation\u2019s growth and profitability, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Corporation Is Subject To Extensive Government Regulation and Supervision and Possible Enforcement and Other Legal Actions\nThe Corporation, primarily through Cullen/Frost, Frost Bank and certain non-bank subsidiaries, is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision, which vests a significant amount of discretion in the various regulatory authorities. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors\u2019 funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not security holders. These regulations and supervisory guidance affect the Corporation\u2019s lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things. Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, instituted major changes to the banking and financial institutions regulatory regimes. Other changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies or supervisory guidance, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations, policies or supervisory guidance, could affect the Corporation in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject the Corporation to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products the Corporation may offer and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things. Failure to comply with laws, regulations, policies or supervisory guidance could result in enforcement and other legal actions by Federal or state authorities, including criminal and civil penalties, the loss of FDIC insurance, the revocation of a banking charter, other sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputational damage. In this regard, government authorities, including the bank regulatory agencies, are pursuing aggressive enforcement actions with respect to compliance and other legal matters involving financial activities, which heightens the risks associated with actual and perceived compliance failures. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSee the sections captioned \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d included in Item 1. Business and Note 10 - Capital and Regulatory Matters in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, which are located elsewhere in this report.\nThe Corporation\u2019s Accounting Estimates and Risk Management Processes Rely On Analytical and Forecasting Models\nThe processes the Corporation uses to estimate its probable loan losses and to measure the fair value of financial instruments, as well as the processes used to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on the Corporation\u2019s financial condition and results of operations, depends upon the use of analytical and forecasting models. These models reflect assumptions that may not be accurate, particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances. Even if these assumptions are adequate, the models may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate because of other flaws in their design or their implementation. If the models the Corporation uses for interest rate risk and asset-liability management are inadequate, the Corporation may incur increased or unexpected losses upon changes in market interest rates or other market measures. If the models the Corporation uses for determining its probable loan losses are inadequate, the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to support future charge-offs. If the models the Corporation uses to measure the fair value of financial instruments are inadequate, the fair value of such financial instruments may fluctuate unexpectedly or may not accurately reflect what the Corporation could realize upon sale or settlement of such financial instruments. Any such failure in the Corporation\u2019s analytical or forecasting models could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Repeal Of Federal Prohibitions On Payment Of Interest On Demand Deposits Could Increase The Corporation\u2019s Interest Expense\nAll federal prohibitions on the ability of financial institutions to pay interest on demand deposit accounts were repealed as part of the Dodd-Frank Act beginning on July 21, 2011. As a result, some financial institutions have commenced offering interest on demand deposits to compete for customers. The Corporation does not yet know what interest rates other institutions may offer as market interest rates begin to increase. The Corporation\u2019s interest expense will increase and its net interest margin will decrease if it begins offering interest on demand deposits to attract additional customers or maintain current customers, which could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Corporation May Need To Raise Additional Capital In The Future, and Such Capital May Not Be Available When Needed Or At All\nThe Corporation may need to raise additional capital in the future to provide it with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet its commitments and business needs, particularly if its asset quality or earnings were to deteriorate significantly. The Corporation\u2019s ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on, among other things, conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of its control, and its financial condition. Economic conditions and the loss of confidence in financial institutions may increase the Corporation\u2019s cost of funding and limit access to certain customary sources of capital, including inter-bank borrowings, repurchase agreements and borrowings from the discount window of the Federal Reserve Board.\nThe Corporation cannot assure that such capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all. Any occurrence that may limit the Corporation\u2019s access to the capital markets, such as a decline in the confidence of debt purchasers, depositors of Frost Bank or counterparties participating in the capital markets, or a downgrade of Cullen/Frost\u2019s or Frost Bank\u2019s debt ratings, may adversely affect the Corporation\u2019s capital costs and its ability to raise capital and, in turn, its liquidity. Moreover, if the Corporation needs to raise capital in the future, it may have to do so when many other financial institutions are also seeking to raise capital and would have to compete with those institutions for investors. An inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a materially adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Value Of The Corporation\u2019s Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets May Decline In The Future\nAs of December 31, 2014, the Corporation had $666.1 million of goodwill and other intangible assets. A significant decline in the Corporation\u2019s expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the business climate, slower growth rates or a significant and sustained decline in the price of Cullen/Frost\u2019s common stock may necessitate taking charges in the future related to the impairment of the Corporation\u2019s goodwill and other intangible assets. If the Corporation were to conclude that a future write-down of goodwill and other intangible assets is necessary, the Corporation would record the appropriate charge, which could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Corporation\u2019s Controls and Procedures May Fail or Be Circumvented\nThe Corporation\u2019s internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures are based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of the Corporation\u2019s controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNew Lines Of Business Or New Products and Services May Subject The Corporation To Additional Risks\nFrom time to time, the Corporation may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services the Corporation may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. Furthermore, any new line of business and/or new product or service could have a significant impact on the\neffectiveness of the Corporation\u2019s system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCullen/Frost Relies On Dividends From Its Subsidiaries For Most Of Its Revenue\nCullen/Frost is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. It receives substantially all of its revenue from dividends from its subsidiaries. These dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on Cullen/Frost\u2019s common stock and interest and principal on Cullen/Frost\u2019s debt. Various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that Frost Bank and certain non-bank subsidiaries may pay to Cullen/Frost. Also, Cullen/Frost\u2019s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary\u2019s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary\u2019s creditors. In the event Frost Bank is unable to pay dividends to Cullen/Frost, Cullen/Frost may not be able to service debt, pay obligations or pay dividends on the Corporation\u2019s common stock. The inability to receive dividends from Frost Bank could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSee the section captioned \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d in Item 1. Business and Note 10 - Capital and Regulatory Matters in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, which are located elsewhere in this report.\nPotential Acquisitions May Disrupt The Corporation\u2019s Business and Dilute Stockholder Value\nThe Corporation generally seeks merger or acquisition partners that are culturally similar and have experienced management and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management, economies of scale or expanded services. Acquiring other banks, businesses, or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nPotential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company.\n\u2022\nExposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company.\n\u2022\nPotential disruption to the Corporation\u2019s business.\n\u2022\nPotential diversion of the Corporation\u2019s management\u2019s time and attention.\n\u2022\nThe possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company.\n\u2022\nDifficulty in estimating the value of the target company.\n\u2022\nPotential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target company.\nAcquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and, therefore, some dilution of the Corporation\u2019s tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction. Furthermore, failure to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs part of the approval process in connection with the acquisition of WNB, the Corporation agreed with the Federal Reserve that before bringing them any further expansionary proposals, the Corporation would enhance certain compliance programs, including those related to fair lending. The Corporation is currently working on these enhancements.\nThe Corporation Is Subject To Liquidity Risk\nThe Corporation requires liquidity to meet its deposit and debt obligations as they come due. The Corporation\u2019s access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance its activities or on terms that are acceptable to it could be impaired by factors that affect it specifically or the financial services industry or economy generally. Factors that could reduce its access to liquidity sources include a downturn in the Texas market, difficult credit markets or adverse regulatory actions against the Corporation. The Corporation\u2019s access to deposits may also be affected by the liquidity needs of its depositors. In particular, a substantial majority of the Corporation\u2019s liabilities are demand, savings, interest checking and money market deposits, which are payable on demand or upon several days\u2019 notice, while by comparison, a substantial portion of its assets are loans, which cannot be called or sold in the same time frame. The Corporation may not be able to replace maturing deposits and advances as necessary in the future, especially if a large number of its\ndepositors sought to withdraw their accounts, regardless of the reason. A failure to maintain adequate liquidity could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Corporation May Not Be Able To Attract and Retain Skilled People\nThe Corporation\u2019s success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key people. Competition for the best people in most activities engaged in by the Corporation can be intense and the Corporation may not be able to hire people or to retain them. The Corporation does not currently have employment agreements or non-competition agreements with any of its senior officers. The unexpected loss of services of key personnel of the Corporation could have a material adverse impact on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations because of their skills, knowledge of the Corporation\u2019s market, years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.\nThe Corporation\u2019s Information Systems May Experience An Interruption Or Breach In Security\nThe Corporation relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in the Corporation\u2019s customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems. Moreover, if any such failures, interruptions or security breaches do occur, they may not be adequately addressed. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions or security breaches of the Corporation\u2019s information systems could damage the Corporation\u2019s reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject the Corporation to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose the Corporation to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Corporation Continually Encounters Technological Change\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. The Corporation\u2019s future success depends, in part, upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in the Corporation\u2019s operations. Many of the Corporation\u2019s competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. The Corporation may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Corporation Is Subject To Claims and Litigation Pertaining To Fiduciary Responsibility\nFrom time to time, customers make claims and take legal action pertaining to the Corporation\u2019s performance of its fiduciary responsibilities. Whether customer claims and legal action related to the Corporation\u2019s performance of its fiduciary responsibilities are founded or unfounded, if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to the Corporation they may result in significant financial liability and/or adversely affect the market perception of the Corporation and its products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services. Any financial liability or reputational damage could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Corporation\u2019s Operations Rely On Certain External Vendors\nThe Corporation relies on certain external vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain day-to-day operations of the Corporation. Accordingly, the Corporation\u2019s operations are exposed to risk that these vendors will not perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements under service level agreements. The failure of an external vendor to perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements under service level agreements, because of changes in the vendor\u2019s organizational structure, financial condition, support for existing products and services or strategic focus or for any other reason, could be disruptive to the Corporation\u2019s operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business and, in turn, the Corporation\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Corporation Is Subject to Claims and Litigation Pertaining to Intellectual Property\nBanking and other financial services companies, such as the Corporation, rely on technology companies to provide information technology products and services necessary to support the Corporations\u2019 day-to-day operations. Technology companies frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, patent holding companies seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained. Competitors of the Corporation\u2019s vendors, or other individuals or companies, have from time to time claimed to hold intellectual property sold to the Corporation by its vendors. Such claims may increase in the future as the financial services sector becomes more reliant on information technology vendors. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.\nRegardless of the scope or validity of such patents or other intellectual property rights, or the merits of any claims by potential or actual litigants, the Corporation may have to engage in protracted litigation. Such litigation is often expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Corporation\u2019s operations, and distracting to management. If the Corporation is found to infringe upon one or more patents or other intellectual property rights, it may be required to pay substantial damages or royalties to a third-party. In certain cases, the Corporation may consider entering into licensing agreements for disputed intellectual property, although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These licenses may also significantly increase the Corporation\u2019s operating expenses. If legal matters related to intellectual property claims were resolved against the Corporation or settled, the Corporation could be required to make payments in amounts that could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Corporation Is Subject To Environmental Liability Risk Associated With Lending Activities\nA significant portion of the Corporation\u2019s loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, the Corporation may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, the Corporation may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require the Corporation to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit the Corporation\u2019s ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase the Corporation\u2019s exposure to environmental liability. Environmental reviews of real property before initiating foreclosure actions may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSevere Weather, Natural Disasters, Acts Of War Or Terrorism and Other External Events Could Significantly Impact The Corporation\u2019s Business\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on the Corporation\u2019s ability to conduct business. In addition, such events could affect the stability of the Corporation\u2019s deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause the Corporation to incur additional expenses. The occurrence of any such event in the future could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFinancial Services Companies Depend On The Accuracy and Completeness Of Information About Customers and Counterparties\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions, the Corporation may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements, credit reports and other financial information. The Corporation may also rely on representations of those customers, counterparties or other third parties, such as independent auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. Reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements, credit reports or other financial information could have a material adverse impact on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Associated With The Corporation\u2019s Common Stock\nThe Corporation\u2019s Stock Price Can Be Volatile\nStock price volatility may make it more difficult for you to resell your common stock when you want and at prices you find attractive. The Corporation\u2019s stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including, among other things:\n\u2022\nActual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of operations.\n\u2022\nRecommendations by securities analysts.\n\u2022\nOperating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to the Corporation.\n\u2022\nNews reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the financial services industry.\n\u2022\nPerceptions in the marketplace regarding the Corporation and/or its competitors.\n\u2022\nNew technology used, or services offered, by competitors.\n\u2022\nSignificant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving the Corporation or its competitors.\n\u2022\nFailure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions.\n\u2022\nChanges in government regulations.\n\u2022\nGeopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts.\nGeneral market fluctuations, including real or anticipated changes in the strength of the Texas economy; industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events, such as economic slowdowns or recessions; interest rate changes or credit loss trends could also cause the Corporation\u2019s stock price to decrease regardless of operating results.\nThe Trading Volume In The Corporation\u2019s Common Stock Is Less Than That Of Other Larger Financial Services Companies\nAlthough the Corporation\u2019s common stock is listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the trading volume in its common stock is less than that of other, larger financial services companies. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of the Corporation\u2019s common stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which the Corporation has no control. Given the lower trading volume of the Corporation\u2019s common stock, significant sales of the Corporation\u2019s common stock, or the expectation of these sales, could cause the Corporation\u2019s stock price to fall.\nCullen/Frost May Not Continue To Pay Dividends On Its Common Stock In The Future\nHolders of Cullen/Frost common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as its board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Although Cullen/Frost has historically declared cash dividends on its common stock, it is not required to do so and may reduce or eliminate its common stock dividend in the future. This could adversely affect the market price of Cullen/Frost\u2019s common stock. Also, Cullen/Frost is a bank holding company, and its ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain federal regulatory considerations, including the guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board regarding capital adequacy and dividends.\nAs more fully discussed in Note 10 - Capital and Regulatory Matters in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, which are located elsewhere in this report, the ability of the Corporation to declare or pay dividends on its common stock may also be subject to certain restrictions in the event that the Corporation elects to defer the payment of interest on its junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures or does not declare and pay dividends on its Series A Preferred Stock.\nAn Investment In The Corporation\u2019s Common Stock Is Not An Insured Deposit\nThe Corporation\u2019s common stock is not a bank deposit and, therefore, is not insured against loss by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity. Investment in the Corporation\u2019s common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this report and is subject to the same market forces that affect the price of common stock in any company. As a result, if you acquire the Corporation\u2019s common stock, you could lose some or all of your investment.\nCertain Banking Laws May Have An Anti-Takeover Effect\nProvisions of federal banking laws, including regulatory approval requirements, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the Corporation, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to the Corporation\u2019s shareholders. These provisions effectively inhibit a non-negotiated merger or other business combination, which, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of the Corporation\u2019s common stock.", "PERMNO": 27888, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "CFR"}
