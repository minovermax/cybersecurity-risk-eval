{"cik": "1019737", "company": "NAVIGANT CONSULTING INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to other information contained in this report and in the documents incorporated by reference herein, the following factors should be considered carefully in evaluating us and our business. These factors could materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or stock price in future periods. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also could materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or stock price in future periods.\nRisks Related to the Market\nOur business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by disruptions in the marketplace caused by economic and political conditions.\nEconomic and political conditions affect our clients\u2019 businesses and the markets they serve. A severe and/or prolonged economic downturn or a negative or uncertain political climate could adversely affect our clients\u2019 financial condition and the levels and types of business activity engaged in by our clients and the industries we serve. Clients could determine that discretionary projects are no longer viable or that new projects are not advisable. This may reduce demand for our services, depress pricing for our services or render certain of our services obsolete, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Changes in economic conditions could drive changes to the regulatory or legislative landscape and consequently shift demand to services that we do not offer or for which we do not have competitive advantages, and this could negatively affect the amount of new business that we are able to obtain. If we are unable to appropriately manage costs or if we are unable to successfully anticipate changing economic and political conditions, we may be unable to effectively plan for and respond to those changes, and our business could be adversely affected. Additionally, significant economic turmoil or financial market disruptions could\nadversely impact the availability of financing to our clients and in turn may adversely impact our ability to collect amounts due from our clients or cause them to terminate their contracts with us, each of which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur business could be adversely impacted by competition and regulatory and legislative changes.\nThe market for our services is highly competitive, highly fragmented, and subject to rapid change. The market includes a large number of participants with a variety of skills and industry expertise, including general management and information technology consulting firms, strategy firms, the global accounting firms and other local, regional, national, and international consulting firms. Many of these firms are international in scope and have larger teams of personnel and greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. Some firms may have lower overhead and other operating costs and, therefore, may be able to more effectively compete through lower cost service offerings. Many of our clients operate in highly regulated industries such as healthcare, energy, financial services and insurance. Regulatory and legislative changes in these industries could potentially render certain of our service offerings obsolete and decrease our competitive position. If we cannot compete effectively, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted.\nOur inability to successfully recruit, retain and incentivize our senior-level employees will affect our ability to win new client engagements and compete effectively.\nWe rely heavily on a group of senior-level employees and business development professionals. We believe our future success is dependent on our ability to successfully recruit and retain their services. Competition for skilled employees is intense, and compensation and retention related issues are a continuing challenge. The consulting industry has low barriers to entry making it easy for employees to start their own businesses or work independently. In addition, it is relatively easy for employees to change employers. Although we offer various incentive compensation programs, including share-based compensation designed to retain and incentivize our senior-level employees, there can be no assurance that these programs will be effective. Further, limitations on available shares under our equity compensation plans or a sustained decline in our stock price could also affect our ability to offer adequate share-based compensation as incentives to our senior-level employees.\nOur inability to successfully recruit, retain and incentivize our senior-level employees could have an adverse effect on our ability to win new client engagements or meet client needs in our current engagements, and our results of operations could be adversely affected. Further, our failure to realize the expected financial returns from our recruiting or incentive investments could adversely impact our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Capital and Financing\nWe cannot be assured that we will have access to sufficient sources of capital to meet our cash needs.\nWe rely on our current cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit agreement to fund our short-term and anticipated long-term operating and investing activities. Our credit agreement provides a $400.0 million revolving credit facility. At our option, subject to the terms and conditions in the credit agreement, we may elect to increase commitments under the credit facility up to an aggregate amount of $500.0 million. The credit facility becomes due and payable in full upon maturity in September 2018. At December 31, 2014, we had $109.8 million in borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and approximately $275 million available. There can be no assurance that the credit facility will continue to be sufficient to meet the future needs of our business, particularly if a decline in our financial performance occurs. If this occurs, and we are unable to otherwise increase our operating cash flows or raise additional capital or obtain other debt financing, we may be unable to meet our future cash needs, including, for example, funding our acquisitions. Furthermore, if our clients\u2019 financial condition were to deteriorate, impairing their ability to make payments due to us, our operating cash flows would be adversely impacted which could require us to fund a greater portion of our working capital needs with borrowings under our credit facility. Lastly, certain financial institutions that are lenders under our credit facility could be adversely impacted by significant economic turmoil or financial market disruptions and therefore could become unable to meet their commitments under our credit facility, which in turn would reduce the amounts available to us under that facility.\nOur failure to comply with the covenants in our credit agreement could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity.\nOur credit agreement contains financial covenants requiring that we maintain, among other things, certain levels of fixed charge and debt coverage. Poor financial performance could cause us to be in default of these covenants. While we were in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2014, there can be no assurance that we will remain in compliance in the future. Our borrowings under the credit facility tend to be higher during the first half of the year to fund annual incentive payments, and as a result, our consolidated leverage ratio is expected to increase from December 31, 2014 levels. If we fail to comply with the covenants in our credit agreement, this could result in our having to seek an amendment or waiver from our lenders to avoid the termination of their commitments and/or the acceleration of the maturity of outstanding amounts under the credit facility. The cost of our obtaining an amendment or waiver could be significant, and further, there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain an amendment or waiver. If our lenders were unwilling to enter into an amendment or provide a waiver, all amounts outstanding under our credit facility would become immediately due and payable.\nWe have variable rate indebtedness which subjects us to interest rate risk and may cause our annual debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under our credit facility are based on short term variable rates of interest which expose us to interest rate risk. While market interest rates have remained low for some time, these rates could increase, adversely impacting our interest expense, cash outflows and results of operations. From time to time, we use derivative instruments for non-trading purposes, primarily consisting of interest rate swap agreements, to manage our interest rate exposure by achieving a desired proportion of fixed rate versus variable rate borrowings. There can be no assurance, however, that our derivative instruments will be successful in reducing the risks inherent in exposure to interest rate fluctuations.\nRisks Related to our Business Operations\nOur results of operations and consequently our business may suffer if we are not able to maintain current pricing, compensation costs and productivity levels.\nOur revenues and profitability are largely based on the pricing of our services, compensation costs and the number of hours our client-service employees work on client engagements. Accordingly, if we are not able to maintain adequate pricing for our services, maintain compensation costs or appropriately manage productivity levels, our results of operations may suffer. Pricing, compensation costs and productivity levels are affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nOur ability to predict future demand for our services and maintain the appropriate staffing levels without significant underutilized Consulting employees and significant lack of productivity from our Technology, Data & Process employees;\n\u2022\nOur ability to transition client-service employees from completed client engagements to new client engagements;\n\u2022\nOur clients\u2019 perceptions of our ability to add value through our services;\n\u2022\nOur competitors\u2019 pricing of services and compensation levels;\n\u2022\nThe market demand for our services;\n\u2022\nThe market rate for employee compensation costs;\n\u2022\nOur ability to manage our human capital resources particularly as we increase the size and diversity of our workforce and expand into new service offerings as part of our growth strategies;\n\u2022\nThe economic, political and regulatory environment as noted above; and\n\u2022\nOur ability to accurately estimate and appropriately manage the costs of fixed-fee client engagements.\nSome of the work we do involves greater risk than ordinary engagements which could negatively impact our business.\nWe do work for clients that for financial, legal, reputational or other reasons may present higher than normal risks. While we attempt to identify and mitigate our exposure with respect to higher-risk engagements and higher-risk clients, these efforts may be ineffective and an actual or alleged error or omission on our part or the part of our client or other third parties on one or more of these higher-risk engagements could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition. Examples of higher-risk engagements include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nInterim management engagements, including those for hospitals and other healthcare providers;\n\u2022\nEngagements where we assist clients in complying with healthcare-related regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nCorporate restructuring engagements, both inside and outside of bankruptcy proceedings;\n\u2022\nEngagements where we provide transactional or a valuation advisory service;\n\u2022\nEngagements where we deliver a fairness opinion;\n\u2022\nEngagements where we deliver project management services for large construction projects;\n\u2022\nEngagements where we receive or process or host sensitive data, including personal consumer or private health information;\n\u2022\nEngagements where we deliver a compliance effectiveness opinion;\n\u2022\nEngagements involving independent consultants\u2019 reports in support of financings; and\n\u2022\nEngagements for governmental clients.\nOur international operations create special risks that could negatively impact our business.\nWe have offices in the United Kingdom, Canada, China, Singapore, United Arab Emirates and other countries outside of the U.S. and conduct business in several other countries. We expect to continue to expand globally and our international revenues may account for an increasing portion of our revenues in the future. Our international operations carry special financial, business, legal and reputational risks, including:\n\u2022\nCultural and language difference in conducting business;\n\u2022\nEmployment laws and related factors that could result in lower utilization, higher compensation costs and cyclical fluctuations of utilization and revenues;\n\u2022\nCurrency fluctuations that could adversely affect our financial position and operating results;\n\u2022\nCompliance with varying legal and regulatory requirements, and other barriers to conducting business;\n\u2022\nImpact on consulting spend from international firms and global economies effected by the European sovereign debt crisis and related government and economic responses;\n\u2022\nRisks associated with engagements performed by employees and independent contractors with governmental officials and agencies, including the risks arising from the anti-bribery and corruption regulations;\n\u2022\nGreater difficulties in managing and staffing foreign operations, including in higher risk geographies;\n\u2022\nSuccessful entry and execution in new markets;\n\u2022\nRestrictions on the repatriation of earnings; and\n\u2022\nPotentially adverse tax consequences, such as net operating loss carry forwards that cannot be realized or higher effective tax rates.\nIf we are not able to successfully mitigate the special risks associated with our international operations, our business prospects and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nOur inability to effectively execute on long-term growth objectives could adversely affect our results of operations and our share value.\nAchievement of our long-term growth objectives may require additional investments in technology, people and acquisitions. These investments may be significantly different in size, nature and complexity in comparison to those we have made in the past, which could inherently create more risk around those investment decisions than would otherwise be the case. Specifically:\n\u2022\nIncentive compensation programs designed to motivate growth may result in innovation or investments that drive near-term growth, but that do not achieve longer-term growth and profitability objectives, or may incentivize an increase in risk compared to our current risk tolerance.\n\u2022\nInvestments in acquisitions may result in growth in businesses that may add to near-term revenues and earnings, but may negatively impact shareholder return over the long-term if they do not perform as expected, or may otherwise create higher longer-term risks, including new legal, compliance, or regulatory implications.\n\u2022\nThe businesses and services added through these investments may extend beyond the knowledge, expertise or resources of our current management team, which could result in unintended risks.\nOur inability to successfully maintain a sales pipeline and to attract business from new or existing clients could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nMany of our client engagement agreements are short term in nature (less than one year) or can be terminated by our clients with little or no notice and without penalty. For example, in our litigation-related engagements, if the litigation is settled, our services usually are no longer necessary and our engagement is promptly terminated. Some of our services involve multiple engagements or stages. In those engagements, there is a risk that a client may choose not to retain us for the additional stages of an engagement or that a client will cancel or delay additional planned engagements. Our client engagements are usually relatively short term in comparison to our office-related expenses and other infrastructure commitments. Therefore, we rely heavily on our senior-level employees\u2019 ability to develop new business opportunities for our services.\nIn the past, we have derived significant revenues from events as inherently unpredictable as the Dodd-Frank Act, healthcare reform, the credit crisis and significant natural disasters including major hurricanes and earthquakes. Those events, in addition to being unpredictable, often have impacts that decline over time as clients adjust to and compensate for the challenges they face. These factors also limit our ability to predict future revenues and human capital resource needs especially for large engagements that may end abruptly due to factors beyond our control which in turn could adversely impact our results of operations.\nUnsuccessful client engagements could result in damage to our professional reputation or legal liability which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur professional reputation and that of our client-service employees is critical to our ability to successfully compete for new client engagements and attract and retain employees. In addition, our client engagements subject us to the risk of legal liability. Any public assertion or litigation alleging that our services were deficient or that we breached any of our obligations to a client could expose us to significant legal liabilities, distract our management and damage our reputation. Our professional liability insurance may not cover every type of claim or liability that could potentially arise from our client engagements. In addition, the limits of our insurance coverage may not be enough to cover a particular claim or a group of claims and the costs of defense. Any factors that damage our professional reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may not be able to maintain the equity in our brand name.\nWe believe that the Navigant brand is an important part of our overall effort to attract and retain clients and that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition for our services increases. We may expand our marketing activities to promote and strengthen our brand and may need to increase our marketing budget,\nhire additional marketing personnel or expend additional amounts to protect our brand and otherwise to create and maintain client brand loyalty. If we fail to effectively promote and maintain the Navigant brand, or incur excessive expenses in doing so, our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nWe encounter professional conflicts of interest.\nIf we are unable to accept new client engagements for any reason, including business and legal conflicts, our client-service employees may become underutilized or discontented, which may adversely affect our future results of operations, as well as our ability to retain these consultants. In addition, although we have systems and procedures to identify potential conflicts of interest prior to accepting a new client engagement, there is no guarantee that all potential conflicts of interest will be identified, and undetected conflicts may result in damage to our professional reputation and result in legal liability which may adversely impact our business.\nWe may be exposed to potential risks if we are unable to achieve and maintain effective internal controls.\nIf we fail to achieve and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting or fail to implement necessary new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes, we may fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis, and may be unable to adequately or accurately report on our business and our results of operations. Even with adequate internal controls, we may not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud. Also, internal controls that are currently adequate may in the future become inadequate because of changes in conditions or changes in regulatory standards, and the degree of compliance with our policies or procedures may deteriorate. This could have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations.\nAcquired businesses may not achieve expected results which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe have grown our business, in part, through the acquisition of complementary businesses. The substantial majority of the purchase price we pay for acquired businesses is related to goodwill and intangible assets. We may not be able to realize the value of those assets or otherwise realize anticipated synergies unless we are able to effectively integrate the businesses we acquire. We face multiple challenges in integrating acquired businesses and their personnel, including differences in corporate cultures and management styles, retention of personnel, conflict issues with clients, and the need to divert managerial resources that would otherwise be dedicated to our current businesses. Additionally, certain senior-level consultants, as sellers of the acquired businesses, are bound by non-competition covenants that expire after a specific amount of time from the date of acquisition. When these covenants expire, our inability to retain these senior-level consultants could significantly impact the acquired businesses and their successful integration. Any failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses and retain personnel could cause the acquired businesses to fail to achieve their expected results, which would in turn adversely affect our financial performance and may require a possible impairment of the acquired assets. Additionally, the financing of acquisitions through cash, borrowings or common stock could also impair our liquidity or cause significant dilution of our shareholders.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant portion of our assets, and an impairment of these assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause we have acquired a significant number of businesses, goodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant portion of our total assets. Under generally accepted accounting principles, we are required to perform an annual impairment test at the reporting unit level on our goodwill and, on a quarterly basis, we are required to assess the recoverability of both our goodwill and long-lived intangible assets. We consider our operating segments to be our reporting units. We may need to perform an impairment test more frequently if events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, attrition of key personnel, a prolonged decline in our stock price and market capitalization, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale or disposition of a significant portion of one of our businesses, and other factors. If the fair\nmarket value of one of our reporting units or other long-lived intangible assets is less than the carrying amount of the related assets, we could be required to record an impairment charge in the future. The valuation of our reporting units requires judgment in estimating future cash flows, discount rates and other factors. In making these judgments, we evaluate the financial health of our reporting units, including such factors as market performance, changes in our client base and projected growth rates. Because these factors are ever changing, due to market and general business conditions, we cannot predict whether, and to what extent, our goodwill and long-lived intangible assets may be impaired in future periods. During the second quarter 2014, in conjunction with our annual goodwill impairment test, we recorded a $122.0 million goodwill impairment related to our Disputes, Investigations, & Economics segment. At December 31, 2014, we had goodwill of $568.1 million and net intangible assets of $26.5 million. The amount of any future impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. See Note 6 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net to the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nWe are subject to unpredictable risks of litigation.\nAlthough we seek to avoid litigation whenever possible, from time to time we are party to various lawsuits and claims. Disputes may arise, for example, from client engagements, employment issues, regulatory actions, business acquisitions and real estate and other commercial transactions. There can be no assurances that any lawsuits or claims will be immaterial in the future. Any material lawsuits or claims could adversely affect our business and reputation.\nOur work with governmental clients has inherent risks related to the governmental contracting process.\nWe work for various U.S., state, local and foreign governmental entities and agencies. These engagements have special risks that include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nGovernmental agencies generally reserve the right to audit our contract costs, including allocated indirect costs, and conduct inquiries and investigations of our business practices with respect to governmental contracts. If the governmental entity finds that the costs are not reimbursable, then we will not be allowed to bill for them or the cost must be refunded to the governmental entity if it has already been paid to us. Findings from an audit also may result in our being required to prospectively adjust previously agreed rates for work which would affect our future profit margins.\n\u2022\nIf a governmental client discovers improper or illegal activities in the course of its audits or investigations, we may become subject to various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with other agencies of that government.\n\u2022\nGovernmental contracts, and the proceedings surrounding them, are often subject to political sensitivities and more extensive scrutiny and publicity than other commercial contracts. Negative publicity related to our governmental contracts, regardless of whether it is accurate, may damage our business by impairing our professional reputation and our ability to compete for new client engagements.\nThe impact of any of the occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only our relationship with the particular governmental agency involved, but also other agencies of the same or other governmental entities as well as other non-governmental clients. Depending on the size of the engagement or the magnitude of the potential costs, penalties or negative publicity involved, any of these occurrences or conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nOur revenues, operating income and cash flows are likely to fluctuate.\nWe experience periodic fluctuations in our revenues, operating income and cash flows and expect that this will continue to occur in the future due to timing and duration of our client engagements, utilization of our consultants, the types of engagements we are working on at different times, the geographic locations of our clients or where the services are rendered, the length of billing and collection cycles, hiring, business and asset acquisitions including the integration of those acquired businesses into our firm, and general economic factors\nbeyond our control. We may also experience future fluctuations in our cash flows because of increases in\nemployee compensation, including changes to our incentive compensation structure and the timing of incentive payments, which we generally pay during the first quarter of each year, or hiring or retention payments or bonuses which are paid throughout the year.\nThe expansion and growth of our business process management services and the evolution of our service offerings into new areas subject us to different operational risks than our traditional consulting and expert businesses.\nWith the acquisition of Cymetrix in May 2014, a higher percentage of our net revenues is derived from our Technology, Data & Process businesses, as compared to prior periods. These businesses, in particular, our business process management services, present different operational risks when compared to our traditional consulting and expert businesses. For example, our business process management services involve managing the revenue cycle function for all or certain portions of our physician and hospital clients\u2019 businesses, including the operation, management or oversight of billing, coding and accounts receivable departments that are critical to our clients\u2019 financial performance. In addition, our business process management services business utilizes offshore personnel, including subcontracted personnel in India, which exposes us to additional operational risks, including special risks associated with conducting business internationally. Disruptions in service delivery, regulatory compliance concerns, data privacy and security concerns, particularly in the billing and coding areas, labor disputes, technology issues or other performance problems could damage our clients\u2019 businesses, expose us to enhanced regulatory scrutiny and claims, and harm our reputation and our business.\nAs part of our long-term strategy, we plan to continue to expand our services and solutions into new areas. Expanding into new areas, and providing services to new types of clients may expose us to additional operational, regulatory or other risks specific to these new areas. We could also incur liability if we fail to comply with laws or regulations applicable to the services we provide to our clients.\nIf our pricing estimates do not accurately anticipate the cost, risk and complexity of performing our work, our contracts could have delivery inefficiencies or be unprofitable.\nOur pricing for our fixed fee engagements, particularly in connection with our business process management services engagements that have multi-year pricing agreements, is highly dependent on our forecasts and predictions about the level of effort and cost necessary to deliver the applicable services and solutions. Our estimates are based on available data at the time the fees are set, and could turn out to be materially inaccurate. If we do not accurately estimate the effort, costs or timing for meeting our contractual commitments and/or completing projects to a client\u2019s satisfaction, our contracts could yield lower margins than planned, or be unprofitable. In addition, we may fail to accurately assess the risks associated with potential contracts. This could result in existing contracts and contracts entered into in the future being less profitable than expected or unprofitable, which could have an adverse effect on our overall profitability.\nRisks Related to Technology\nWe have invested in specialized technology and other intellectual property for which we may fail to fully recover our investment or which may become obsolete.\nWe have invested in developing specialized technology and intellectual property, including proprietary systems, processes and methodologies, that we believe provide us a competitive advantage in serving our current clients and winning new client engagements. Many of our service offerings rely on specialized technology or intellectual property that is subject to rapid change, and to the extent that this technology and intellectual property is rendered obsolete and of no further use to us or our clients, our ability to continue offering these services, and grow our revenues, could be adversely affected. There is no assurance that we will be able to develop new, innovative or improved technology or technology and intellectual property or that our technology and intellectual property will effectively compete with the intellectual property developed by our competitors. If we are unable to develop new technology and intellectual property or if our competitors develop better technology or intellectual property, our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the scale and complexity of our business and new service offerings may require additional information systems that we may not be able to implement in a timely or cost effective manner. This may impair our ability to achieve our operating objectives and retain our competitive position, which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations.\nInformation system failures or service interruptions could affect our ability to provide services to our clients.\nWe may be subject to disruption to our operating systems, technology or ability to communicate with our workforce and clients as a result of events that are beyond our control, including but not limited to the possibility of failures at third-party data centers, worker strikes, disruptions to the internet, political instability, natural disasters, malicious attacks, or other conditions. While we have taken steps to prevent such events and have developed disaster recovery processes, there can be no assurance that these steps will be effective in every situation. Such disruptions could adversely affect our ability to fulfill client engagements and as a result may damage our reputation and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIf the integrity of our information systems is compromised or our information systems are inadequate to keep up with the needs of our business, our reputation, business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe depend on information systems to manage and run our business. Additionally, certain services we provide require us to store, transmit or process sensitive or confidential client information, including personal consumer information and health or other personally identifiable information. If any person, including any of our employees or third-party vendors with whom we contract for data hosting services, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches the information security controls we have implemented to protect our clients\u2019 data, or our own data or those security controls prove to be ineffective against intrusion, we could incur legal liability and may also be subject to regulatory enforcement actions, fines and/or criminal prosecution in multiple jurisdictions. Our potential liability in the event of a security breach of client data or our own data could be significant and depending on the circumstances giving rise to the breach, this liability may not be subject to a contractual limit of liability or an exclusion of consequential or indirect damages. Any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive, personal or confidential client information, whether through systems failure, employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients. Similarly, unauthorized access to or through our information systems, including an intentional attack by any person who may develop and deploy viruses, worms or other malicious software programs, could result in negative publicity, legal liability and damage to our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 84103, "SIC": 8742, "TIC": "NCI"}
