Risk Factors\nWe operate in a dynamic and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties. Certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations, and you should carefully consider them. Accordingly, in evaluating our business, we encourage you to consider the following discussion of risk factors, in its entirety, in addition to other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other public filings with the SEC. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Business, including the Development, Regulatory Approval and Potential Commercialization of our Product Candidate, Gimoti\nOur business is entirely dependent on the success of Gimoti, which failed to achieve the primary endpoint of symptom improvement in a Phase 3 clinical trial in female patients with symptoms associated with diabetic gastroparesis. While we have resubmitted our Gimoti NDA based on the results of our completed comparative exposure PK trial, FDA may not agree that we have adequately addressed the issues raised in its CRL from our initial Gimoti NDA submission and we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize, Gimoti.\nTo date, we have devoted all of our research, development and clinical efforts and financial resources toward the development of Gimoti, our patented nasal delivery formulation of metoclopramide for the relief of symptoms associated with acute and recurrent diabetic gastroparesis in adult women. Gimoti is our only product candidate. In July 2016, we announced topline results from our Phase 3 clinical trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Gimoti in women with symptoms associated with diabetic gastroparesis. In this study, Gimoti did not achieve its primary endpoint of symptom improvement in the Intent-to-Treat, or ITT, group at Week 4.\nIn December 2016, we announced the completion of a pre-NDA meeting with FDA, in which FDA agreed that a comparative exposure PK trial was acceptable as a basis for submission of a Gimoti NDA. Data from the comparative exposure PK trial served as a portion of the 505(b)(2) data package and included prior efficacy and safety data developed by us and FDA\u2019s prior findings of safety and efficacy for the Listed Drug, Reglan Tablets 10 mg. In October 2017, we announced positive topline results from the comparative exposure PK trial. In addition, based on feedback received from FDA at an additional pre-NDA meeting, we proposed a REMS and post-approval safety trial as part of the NDA we submitted for Gimoti to FDA on June 1, 2018. In August 2018, we received a Day-74 letter that stated that the NDA was sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review and set a target goal date for a decision under PDUFA of April 1, 2019.\nOn March 1, 2019, we received a DRL from FDA, which provided preliminary notice of certain deficiencies identified during FDA\u2019s initial review of the Gimoti NDA. The DRL described concerns with the information provided in the NDA, including concerns that insufficient data had been offered regarding certain product quality control and reproducibility specific to the commercially available sprayer device used with Gimoti, that there is a lack of adequate information to support sex-based efficacy claims and that the pharmacology data provided may not demonstrate bioavailability to the Listed Drug, Reglan Tablets 10 mg. On March 14, 2019, we submitted a response to the DRL to FDA, and on March 21, 2019, we met with FDA to obtain feedback on our responses.\nOn April 1, 2019, we received a CRL from FDA for our Gimoti NDA. The CRL, while citing fewer issues than the DRL, stated that FDA determined it could not approve the NDA in its present form and provided recommendations to address the remaining approvability issues in an NDA resubmission. The approvability issues were related to clinical pharmacology and product quality/device quality.\nThe clinical pharmacology issue was specific to a low Cmax in subjects representing less than 5% of the total administered Gimoti doses in the pivotal PK study. FDA stated the overall lower mean Cmax was driven by the data from these few doses. We conducted an analysis excluding these aberrant doses, which showed that the PK study met the bioequivalence criteria for both men and women, although there is no assurance that FDA will agree with our conclusion. FDA recommended a root cause analysis to determine the origin of the PK variability and mitigation strategies to address their concern. Additionally, FDA requested data from three registration batches of commercial product to be manufactured at the proposed commercial manufacturing site, by the proposed commercial process and tested using validated analytical methods. These data were requested to provide additional support for the proposed acceptance criteria for droplet size distribution and other essential performance characteristics for the commercial product specifications.\nOn July 25, 2019, we completed a type A meeting with FDA to obtain FDA\u2019s feedback and agreement on our plan to address deficiencies cited in the CRL in support of a resubmission of the Gimoti NDA. The focus of the discussion was on topics noted in the CRL, including the root cause analysis of low drug exposure in the comparative bioavailability study and additional product quality/device quality control testing.\nOn December 19, 2019, based on FDA feedback received during the type A meeting, we resubmitted the Gimoti NDA to FDA. The resubmission provided the requested additional information intended to address the deficiencies cited in the CRL. To address the clinical pharmacology issues, the resubmission included an in-depth root cause analysis, as well as patient use and experience data from our clinical trials. To address product quality/device quality issues cited in the CRL, the resubmission included 3-month stability data from commercial scale registration batches that met all product specifications. We believe these data support the acceptance\ncriteria for performance characteristics and device quality control we proposed in the Gimoti NDA. Additionally, as requested by FDA, the resubmission included data from an analysis of pump performance characteristics for the product used in the comparative bioavailability study and the product from commercial scale registration batches. The results of this testing showed all products performed within specifications. However, FDA may determine that our root cause analysis and additional patient data and/or the stability data, including our proposed acceptance criteria for performance characteristics and device quality, do not adequately address the issues raised in the CRL, and/or support approval of the NDA, and may later require us to conduct additional human clinical trials prior to approval.\nOn January 17, 2020, we received a notice from FDA that it had accepted our NDA resubmission for review and set a target goal date for a decision under PDUFA of June 19, 2020. However, the review process and the PDUFA target action date may be extended if FDA requests or we otherwise provide additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission. FDA\u2019s review goals are subject to change, and the duration of FDA\u2019s review may depend on the number and type of other NDAs that are submitted to FDA around the same time period.\nBecause our business is entirely dependent on the success of Gimoti, if we are unable to successfully complete development of and receive regulatory approval of this product candidate, we will be required to curtail all of our activities and may be required to liquidate, dissolve or otherwise wind down our operations. Any of these events could result in the complete loss of an investment in our securities.\nIn addition to the above factors, the future regulatory and commercial success of Gimoti is subject to a number of additional risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to provide acceptable evidence of safety and efficacy for Gimoti, including as a result of the proposed duration of use for Gimoti being shorter as compared to the maximum approved dosing duration for the referenced Listed Drug, Reglan Tablets 10 mg;\n\u2022\nthe results of our clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical or clinical significance or other bioequivalence parameters required by FDA for marketing approval, including Cmax falling below the equivalence range in the comparative exposure PK trial;\n\u2022\nFDA may not agree with the analysis of our clinical trial results, including our analysis of results of the PK trial and our root cause analysis to determine the origin of the PK variability raised by FDA in the CRL;\n\u2022\nlater developments with FDA that may be inconsistent with our recent type A meeting;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to undertake additional clinical trials and other studies of Gimoti before we receive approval of the NDA we resubmitted;\n\u2022\nwe may not have sufficient financial and other resources to complete clinical development for Gimoti;\n\u2022\nif approved, Gimoti will compete with well-established products already approved for marketing by FDA, including oral and intravenous forms of metoclopramide, the same active ingredient in the nasal spray for Gimoti;\n\u2022\nour reliance on Eversana and any other third party to commercialize Gimoti, if approved;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to maintain commercial manufacturing arrangements with third-party manufacturers or establish and maintain commercial-scale manufacturing capabilities;\n\u2022\ncontract manufacturers, suppliers and/or consultants may not meet appropriate timelines;\n\u2022\nFDA may disagree with the design of any future clinical trials, if any are necessary;\n\u2022\nsubjects in our clinical trials may die or suffer other adverse effects for reasons that may or may not be related to Gimoti, such as dysgeusia, headache, diarrhea, nasal discomfort, tremor, myoclonus, somnolence, rhinorrhea, throat irritation, and fatigue; and\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to obtain, maintain and enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights.\nOf the large number of drugs in development in this industry, only a small percentage result in the submission of an NDA to FDA and even fewer are approved for commercialization. Furthermore, even if we do receive regulatory approval to market Gimoti, any such approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which we may market the product.\nWe may require substantial additional funding and may be unable to raise capital when needed, which would force us to liquidate, dissolve or otherwise wind down our operations.\nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception. On January 17, 2020, we received a notice from FDA that it had accepted our NDA resubmission for review and set a target goal date for a decision under PDUFA of June 19, 2020. We believe, based on our current operating plan, that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations through the PDUFA target goal date and into the third quarter of 2020. If Gimoti is approved by FDA, additional funds will become\navailable from the Eversana Credit Facility which we believe, based on our current operating plan, will provide sufficient cash to fund our operations into 2021 excluding any potential future Gimoti product revenue. This period could be shortened if there are any significant increases in planned spending other than anticipated. Even with the Eversana Credit Facility, we will be required to raise additional funds in order to continue as a going concern. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional funds on acceptable terms, or at all, to further develop Gimoti, if required, and receive FDA approval of the Gimoti NDA. Because our business is entirely dependent on the success of Gimoti, if we are unable to secure additional financing or identify and execute on other development or strategic alternatives for Gimoti or our company, we will be required to curtail all of our activities and may be required to liquidate, dissolve or otherwise wind down our operations. Any of these events could result in a complete loss of your investment in our securities.\nOur estimates of the amount of cash necessary to fund our activities may prove to be wrong and we could spend our available financial resources much faster than we currently expect. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe potential for FDA to delay the PDUFA target goal date due to FDA\u2019s internal resource constraints or other reasons;\n\u2022\nthe need for, and the progress, costs and results of, any additional clinical trials of Gimoti that may be required by FDA, including any pre-approval or post-approval trials FDA or other regulatory agencies may require evaluating the efficacy or safety of Gimoti;\n\u2022\nthe costs involved for additional data collection and analysis to respond to FDA questions related to the NDA;\n\u2022\nthe outcome, costs and timing of seeking and obtaining regulatory approvals from FDA, and any similar regulatory agencies;\n\u2022\nthe costs and timing of completion of outsourced commercial manufacturing supply arrangements for Gimoti;\n\u2022\nthe costs required to commercialize Gimoti, including expenses incurred under our commercialization agreement with Eversana;\n\u2022\nthe commercial success of Gimoti, if approved;\n\u2022\nthe costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights associated with Gimoti;\n\u2022\nthe terms and timing of any collaborative, licensing, co-promotion or other arrangements that we may establish; and\n\u2022\ncosts associated with any other product candidates that we may develop, in-license or acquire.\nAdditional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders. Furthermore, the issuance of additional shares or other securities by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our shares to decline and dilute the holdings of our existing stockholders. If we raise additional funds by incurring debt, the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations, as well as covenants and specific financial ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business. We cannot provide any assurance that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to enable us to identify or execute a viable plan for continued clinical development of Gimoti or to otherwise survive as a going concern.\nTopline data may not accurately reflect the complete results of a particular study or trial.\nWe may publicly disclose topline or interim data from time to time, which is based on a preliminary analysis of then-available data, and the results and related findings and conclusions are subject to change following a more comprehensive review of the data related to the particular study or trial. We also make assumptions, estimations, calculations and conclusions as part of our analyses of data, and we may not have received or had the opportunity to fully and carefully evaluate all data. As a result, the topline results that we report may differ from future results of the same studies, or different conclusions or considerations may qualify such results, once additional data have been received and fully evaluated. Topline data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published. As a result, topline data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available.\nFurther, others, including regulatory agencies, may not accept or agree with our assumptions, estimates, calculations, conclusions or analyses or may interpret or weigh the importance of data differently, which could impact the value of the particular program, the approvability or commercialization of the particular product candidate or product and our company in general. For example, while we believe that the AUC measurement was the most clinically relevant PK parameter for our comparative exposure PK trial, FDA may disagree or may emphasize other data such as Cmax falling below the equivalence range of the Listed Drug, Reglan Tablets 10 mg. Any contrary views by FDA would impact our dose selection and FDA\u2019s review of the NDA. In addition, the information we choose to publicly disclose regarding a particular study or clinical trial is based on what is typically extensive information, and you or others may not agree with what we determine is the material or otherwise appropriate information to include in our disclosure, and any information we determine not to disclose may ultimately be deemed significant with respect to future decisions, conclusions, views, activities or otherwise regarding a particular drug, drug candidate or our business. If the topline data that we report differ from actual results, or if others, including regulatory authorities, disagree with the conclusions reached, our ability to obtain approval for, and\ncommercialize, our product candidates may be harmed, which could harm our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition. Further, although we reported positive topline data for the PK trial, FDA may still require the conduct of additional efficacy or safety trials.\nIf we are not able to obtain regulatory approval for Gimoti, we will not be able to commercialize this product candidate and our ability to generate revenue will be limited.\nWe have submitted an NDA for Gimoti, but have not received regulatory approval to market any product candidates in any jurisdiction. We are not permitted to market Gimoti in the United States until we receive approval of an NDA for Gimoti in a particular indication from FDA. To date, we have completed a Phase 1 bioavailability and pharmacokinetics trial, a comparative exposure PK trial, a Phase 3 clinical trial in female subjects, a companion Phase 3 clinical trial in male subjects, a Thorough ECG (QT/QTc) study, a Phase 2b clinical trial and we acquired the results from a separate Phase 2 clinical trial in diabetic subjects with gastroparesis. In the Phase 2b clinical trial that we performed ourselves, which concluded in 2011, Gimoti failed to meet the primary endpoint for the trial. Although an overall improvement in symptoms was observed in Gimoti-treated subjects with diabetic gastroparesis compared to placebo in this Phase 2b clinical trial, the difference was not statistically significant due to a high placebo response among male subjects. The earlier Phase 2 clinical trial performed by Questcor was a multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel design study. This head-to-head study compared the efficacy and safety of two doses of metoclopramide nasal spray, 10 mg and 20 mg, with FDA-approved 10 mg metoclopramide tablet. Although data from the earlier Phase 2 clinical trial was referenced in the Gimoti NDA, the open-label study design limits the importance of the efficacy results in the NDA.\nWe completed our Phase 3 clinical trial in female subjects with symptoms associated with acute and recurrent diabetic gastroparesis and announced in July 2016 that Gimoti did not achieve its primary endpoint of symptom improvement at Week 4. While we submitted the results from the comparative exposure PK trial as a portion of the 505(b)(2) NDA submission that included prior efficacy and safety data developed by us along with FDA\u2019s prior findings of safety and efficacy for the Listed Drug, Reglan Tablets 10 mg., there is no guarantee that regulators will agree with our assessment of the clinical trials for Gimoti conducted to date, including the comparative exposure PK trial. In addition, we have only limited experience in filing the applications necessary to gain regulatory approvals and expect to rely on consultants and third-party contract research organizations to assist us in this process. FDA and other regulators have substantial discretion in the approval process and may decide that our data are insufficient for approval and require additional clinical trials, or preclinical or other studies.\nVarying interpretation of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval of a product candidate. Furthermore, we have acquired our rights to Gimoti from Questcor, who acquired its rights from a previous sponsor of the IND. Thus, the preclinical and a portion of the clinical data relating to Gimoti that we submitted in the NDA for Gimoti was obtained from studies conducted before we owned the rights to the product candidate and, accordingly, that were prepared and managed by predecessors. These predecessors may not have applied the same resources and given the same attention to this development program as we would have if we had been in control from inception.\nGimoti and the activities associated with its development and potential commercialization, including its testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution, are subject to comprehensive regulation by FDA and other regulatory agencies in the United States and by comparable authorities in other countries. Failure to obtain regulatory marketing approval for Gimoti will prevent us from commercializing the product candidate, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\nFDA may impose requirements on our clinical trials that are difficult to comply with, which could harm our business.\nIn July 2015, and again in August 2019, FDA published draft guidance intended to assist sponsors in the clinical development of drugs for the treatment of diabetic and idiopathic gastroparesis clinical trials, Gastroparesis: Clinical Evaluation of Drugs for Treatment - Guidance for Industry. We believe that the FDA draft guidance is consistent with the advice FDA provided to us regarding trial design and study endpoints for our completed Phase 3 trials. In addition, the FDA draft guidance explicitly states that there is an urgent medical need for development of safe and effective drugs to treat patients with gastroparesis and acknowledges that \u201cpatients with diabetic gastroparesis may experience further derangement of glucose control because of unpredictable gastric emptying and altered absorption of orally administered hypoglycemic drugs.\u201d FDA draft guidance, however, does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and do not operate to bind FDA or the public, and FDA may ultimately disagree with our interpretation regarding the meaning or applicability of any published Guidance documents.\nWe conducted a Phase 3 trial in adult female subjects with diabetic gastroparesis, which failed to reach its primary endpoint. However, following our second pre-NDA meeting with FDA in December 2016, FDA agreed that a comparative exposure PK trial, along with prior efficacy and safety data from other completed Gimoti studies, would be appropriate for NDA submission seeking an indication of treatment of symptoms associated with diabetic gastroparesis in women. Although the results from the comparative exposure PK trial along with the prior data were sufficient to submit an NDA for Gimoti in June 2018, it is possible FDA will require additional clinical testing before approval of the NDA. In addition, based on discussions with FDA, we also conducted a similar study for safety and efficacy in adult male subjects with diabetic gastroparesis. A portion of the safety and efficacy data from this trial was submitted as a part of the NDA. If we are unable to comply with FDA\u2019s requirements, we will not be able to obtain approval for Gimoti and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\nAny termination or suspension of, or delays in the completion of, any future clinical trials could result in increased costs to us, delay or limit our ability to generate revenue and adversely affect our commercial prospects.\nDelays in the completion of any future clinical trials for Gimoti could significantly affect our product development costs. We do not know whether any trials will produce data on schedule, if at all. The commencement and completion of clinical trials can be delayed for a number of reasons, including delays related to:\n\u2022\nFDA placing a clinical trial on hold;\n\u2022\nsubjects failing to remain in our trial at the rate we expect (for example, due to variable patient frequency and severity of disease and variability in gastric emptying testing);\n\u2022\nsubjects choosing an alternative treatment for the indication for which we are developing Gimoti, or participating in competing clinical trials;\n\u2022\nsubjects experiencing severe or unexpected drug-related adverse effects;\n\u2022\na facility manufacturing Gimoti, or any of its components, being ordered by FDA or other government or regulatory authorities to temporarily or permanently shut down due to violations of FDA\u2019s cGMP or other applicable requirements, or infections or cross-contaminations of a product candidate in the manufacturing process;\n\u2022\nany changes to our manufacturing process that may be necessary or desired;\n\u2022\nthird-party clinical investigators losing their license or permits necessary to perform our clinical trials, not performing our clinical trials on our anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol, good clinical practice and regulatory requirements, or other third parties not performing data collection and analysis in a timely or accurate manner;\n\u2022\ninspections of clinical trial sites by FDA or the finding of regulatory violations by FDA or IRB that require us to undertake corrective action, result in suspension or termination of one or more sites or the imposition of a clinical hold on the entire trial, or that prohibit us from using some or all of the data in support of our marketing applications;\n\u2022\nthird-party contractors becoming debarred or suspended or otherwise penalized by FDA or other government or regulatory authorities for violations of regulatory requirements, in which case we may need to find a substitute contractor, and we may not be able to use some or any of the data produced by such contractors in support of our marketing applications; or\n\u2022\none or more IRBs refusing to approve, suspending or terminating the trial at an investigational site, precluding enrollment of additional subjects, or withdrawing its approval of the trial.\nProduct development costs will increase if we have delays in testing or approval of Gimoti, or if we need to perform more or larger clinical trials than planned. Additionally, changes in regulatory requirements and policies may occur and we may need to amend clinical trial protocols to reflect these changes. Amendments may require us to resubmit our clinical trial protocols to IRBs for reexamination, which may impact the costs, timing or successful completion of a clinical trial. If we experience delays in completion of or if we, FDA or other regulatory authorities, the IRB, or other reviewing entities, or any of our clinical trial sites suspend or terminate any of our clinical trials, the commercial prospects for our product candidate may be harmed and our ability to generate product revenues will be delayed. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, termination or suspension of, or a delay in the commencement or completion of, clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate. Also, if one or more clinical trials are delayed, our competitors may be able to bring products to market before we do, and the commercial viability of Gimoti could be significantly reduced.\nDelays in the completion of any clinical trials and studies we may conduct for Gimoti could be harmful to our business and cause us to require additional funding.\nFinal marketing approval for Gimoti by FDA or other regulatory authorities for commercial use may be delayed, limited, or denied, any of which would adversely affect our ability to generate operating revenues.\nWe submitted an NDA for Gimoti in June 2018. Under PDUFA, FDA is subject to a two-tiered system of review times - standard review and priority review. For drugs that are not new molecular entities that are subject to standard review, such as Gimoti, FDA has a goal to complete its review of the NDA and respond to the applicant within ten months from the date of receipt of an NDA. In its Day-74 filing communication letter, FDA assigned a target goal date for a decision under PDUFA of April 1, 2019 for the Gimoti NDA. On April 1, 2019, we received a CRL from FDA for our NDA. The CRL stated that FDA could not approve the NDA in its present form and provided recommendations to address the remaining approvability issues in an NDA resubmission.\nOn July 25, 2019, we completed a type A meeting with FDA to obtain FDA\u2019s feedback and agreement on our plan to address deficiencies cited in the CRL in support of a resubmission of the Gimoti NDA. The focus of the discussion was on topics noted in the CRL, including the root cause analysis of low drug exposure in the comparative bioavailability study and additional product quality/device quality control testing.\nOn December 19, 2019, based on FDA feedback received during the type A meeting, we resubmitted the Gimoti NDA to FDA. The resubmission provided the requested additional information intended to address the deficiencies cited in the CRL. To address the\nclinical pharmacology issues, the resubmission included an in-depth root cause analysis, as well as patient use and experience data from our clinical trials. To address product quality/device quality issues cited in the CRL, the resubmission included 3-month stability data from commercial scale registration batches that met all product specifications and support the proposed acceptance criteria for performance characteristics and device quality control. Additionally, as requested by FDA, the resubmission included data from an analysis of pump performance characteristics for the product used in the comparative bioavailability study and the product from commercial scale registration batches. The results of this testing showed all products performed within specifications. In addition, FDA may determine that our root cause analysis and additional patient data and/or the stability data do not adequately address the issues raised in the CRL, or support approval of the NDA, and may later require us to conduct additional human clinical trials prior to approval.\nOn January 17, 2020, we received a notice from FDA that it had accepted our NDA resubmission for review and set a target goal date for a decision under PDUFA of June 19, 2020.\nThe duration of FDA\u2019s review of any resubmitted NDA may depend on the number and type of other NDAs that are submitted with FDA around the same time period. In addition, FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.\nWe cannot provide any assurance as to whether or when we will obtain regulatory approval to commercialize Gimoti. We cannot, therefore, predict the timing of any future revenue. Because Gimoti is our only product candidate this risk is particularly significant for us. We cannot commercialize Gimoti until the appropriate regulatory authorities have reviewed and approved marketing applications for this product candidate. We cannot assure you that the regulatory agencies will complete their review processes in a timely manner or that we will obtain regulatory approval for Gimoti. In addition, we may experience delays or the application may be rejected based upon additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action or changes in FDA policy during the period of product development, clinical trials and FDA regulatory review. For example, in 2009 following an FDA review of metoclopramide spontaneous safety reports, FDA required a boxed warning be added to the metoclopramide product label concerning the chance of tardive dyskinesia, or TD, for patients taking these products. FDA requires a boxed warning (sometimes referred to as a \u201cBlack Box\u201d Warning) for products that have shown a significant risk of severe or life-threatening adverse events. Recently, the European Medicines Agency\u2019s Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, has reviewed and has proposed labeling changes for marketed metoclopramide products in the EU based on age, dosing guidelines or indications. Based on their assessment of the limited efficacy and safety data currently available to the CHMP, the CHMP recommended to the European Medicines Agency that indications with limited or inconclusive efficacy data, including GERD, dyspepsia and gastroparesis, be removed from the approved product label in the EU. There can be no assurance as to whether FDA will re-review approved metoclopramide product labels as a result of any such regulatory actions in the EU or otherwise. If marketing approval for Gimoti is delayed, limited or denied, our ability to market the product candidate, and our ability to generate product sales, would be adversely affected.\nIn addition, in a written communication, FDA responded to our request for proprietary name review by conditionally accepting our proposed proprietary brand name, Gimoti. However, FDA issued the CRL even though it had previously approved this proprietary name. FDA typically conducts a rigorous review of proposed product names, including an evaluation of potential for confusion with the names of other products, which could lead to identification of the wrong medication or other prescribing, ordering, dispensing, administration, or monitoring errors. FDA may also object to a product name if it believes the name functions to overstate the efficacy, minimize the risk, broaden the proposed indication, make unsubstantiated superiority claims, or is otherwise false or misleading. If FDA objects to the product name Gimoti as part of its NDA resubmission review process, we may be required to adopt an alternative name for our product candidate. If we adopt an alternative name, we would lose the benefit of our existing trademark applications for Gimoti and may be required to expend significant additional resources in an effort to identify a suitable product name that would qualify under applicable trademark laws, not infringe the existing rights of third parties and be acceptable to FDA. We may be unable to build a successful brand identity for a new trademark in a timely manner or at all, which would limit our ability to commercialize our product candidate.\nWe have no internal sales, marketing or distribution capabilities currently and will rely on Eversana and other third parties for the commercialization of Gimoti, and we and they may not be able to effectively market, sell and distribute Gimoti, if approved.\nCurrently, we have no internal sales, marketing or distribution capabilities. If Gimoti ultimately receives regulatory approval, we may not be able to effectively market and distribute the product candidate. We have engaged Eversana to manage substantially all activities related to marketing, market access, distribution, sales team, patient reimbursement, and provide related support services. Eversana may be unable to identify and retain suitable candidates to fill our direct sales force needs, on our expected launch timeframe or otherwise. To the extent we and Eversana are not successful in retaining qualified sales and marketing personnel, we may not be able to effectively market Gimoti. Further, there can be no assurance that the capabilities of the Eversana will be effective in marketing and selling Gimoti, or that their personnel will be more effective than an internally developed sales organization. In addition, Eversana may terminate our agreement, including the obligation to provide a line of credit, and can terminate the agreement under certain additional circumstances, including failure to make payments when due, if we are in material breach of the agreement and fail to remedy the breach following notice, if we enter into bankruptcy, or if we are excluded from participation in certain federal governmental programs or have similar actions taken against us. If we and Eversana fail to hire, train, retain and manage qualified\nsales personnel, market our product successfully or on a cost-effective basis or otherwise terminates our relationship, our ability to generate revenue will be limited and we will need to identify and retain an alternative organization, or develop our own sales and marketing capability. In such an event, we would have to invest significant amounts of financial and management resources to develop internal sales, distribution and marketing capabilities. This could involve significant delays and costs, including the diversion of our management\u2019s attention from other activities. We may also need to retain additional consultants or external service providers to assist us in sales, marketing and distribution functions, and may be unsuccessful in retaining such services on acceptable financial terms or at all.\nIf we do perform sales, marketing and distribution functions ourselves, we could face a number of additional related risks, including:\n\u2022\ninability to attract and build an effective marketing department or sales force;\n\u2022\nthe cost of establishing a marketing department or sales force may exceed our available financial resources and the revenues generated by Gimoti or any other product candidates that we may develop, in-license or acquire; and\n\u2022\nour direct sales and marketing efforts may not be successful.\nIf we are unsuccessful in building and managing a sales and marketing infrastructure internally or through a third-party partner for any approved product, we will have difficulty commercializing the product, which would adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe and our contract sales force provider, Eversana, will need to retain qualified sales and marketing personnel and collaborate in order to successfully commercialize Gimoti.\nIn January 2020, we entered into the Eversana Agreement, pursuant to which Eversana will provide a minimum number of sales representatives to promote Gimoti upon its commercial launch, if any. These representatives would be employees of Eversana and would be hired and be managed by Eversana. To the extent Eversana is not successful in retaining qualified sales and marketing personnel, we may not be able to effectively market Gimoti, if approved.\nWe and Eversana each have the right to terminate the Eversana Agreement subject to certain conditions, as described above under \u201cBusiness-Commercialization-Commercial Services and Loan Agreements with Eversana.\u201d While our agreement with Eversana would require sales representatives to undergo onboarding and training, we cannot be sure that Eversana\u2019s efforts will be successful or generate sufficient awareness or demand for Gimoti, if approved.\nAny revenues we receive from sales of Gimoti will largely depend upon the efforts of Eversana, which in many instances will not be within our control. If we are unable to maintain the Eversana Agreement or to effectively establish alternative arrangements to market our products, if any, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, despite our arrangement with Eversana, we still may not be able to cover all of the prescribing physicians for gastroparesis at the same level of reach and frequency as our competitors, and we ultimately may need to further expand our selling efforts in order to effectively compete.\nChanges in funding for FDA and other government agencies could hinder their ability to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel, or otherwise prevent new products and services from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner, which could negatively impact our business.\nThe ability of FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory, and policy changes. Average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of other government agencies that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable.\nDisruptions at FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new drugs to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. For example, over the last several years the U.S. government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as FDA, have had to furlough critical employees and stop critical activities. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, it could significantly impact the ability of FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf the requirements under Section 505(b)(2) are not as we expect, the approval pathway for our primary product candidate will likely take significantly longer, cost significantly more and entail significantly greater complications and risks than anticipated, and in either case may not be successful.\nWe are seeking FDA approval through the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for our primary product candidate, Gimoti. Gimoti is a drug/device combination product that will be regulated under the drug provisions of the FFDCA, which enabled us to submit an NDA seeking its approval. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, added Section 505(b)(2) to the FFDCA. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference.\nIf the requirements under Section 505(b)(2) are not as we expect, we may need to conduct additional clinical trials, provide additional data and information and meet additional standards for regulatory approval. If this were to occur, the time and financial resources required to obtain FDA approval for Gimoti, and the complications and risks associated with our lead product candidate, would likely substantially increase. We may need to obtain additional funding, which could result in significant dilution to the ownership interests of our then existing stockholders to the extent we issue equity securities or convertible debt. We cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain such additional financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Moreover, inability to meet the requirements of Section 505(b)(2) could result in competitive products reaching the market before Gimoti, which could impact our competitive position and prospects. Even if we meet the requirements of Section 505(b)(2), we cannot be assured that Gimoti or any future product candidates will receive the requisite approvals for commercialization.\nEven if we obtain marketing approval for Gimoti, it could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our product candidate, when and if Gimoti is approved.\nEven if U.S. regulatory approval is obtained, FDA may still impose significant restrictions on Gimoti\u2019s indicated uses or marketing or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly and time-consuming post-approval studies, post-market surveillance or clinical trials. For example, FDA requested we include a proposal for a post-marketing safety trial as part of the NDA submission. Gimoti will also be subject to ongoing FDA requirements governing the labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and reporting of safety and other post-market information. In addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP requirements relating to quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents. If we or a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product, the manufacturing facility or us, including requesting recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing.\nIf we or the manufacturing facilities for Gimoti fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may:\n\u2022\nissue warning letters or untitled letters;\n\u2022\nseek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines;\n\u2022\nsuspend or withdraw regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nsuspend any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u2022\nrefuse to approve pending applications or supplements or applications filed by us;\n\u2022\nsuspend or impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or\n\u2022\nseize or detain products, refuse to permit the import or export of product, or request us to initiate a product recall.\nThe occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our products and generate revenue.\nFDA has the authority to require a REMS as a condition of approval of an NDA or following approval, which may impose further requirements or restrictions on the distribution or use of an approved drug, such as limiting prescribing to certain physicians or medical centers that have undergone specialized training, limiting treatment to patients who meet certain safe-use criteria and requiring treated patients to enroll in a registry. In March 2009, FDA informed drug manufacturers that it will require a REMS for metoclopramide drug products, including a Medication Guide, elements to assure safe use (including an education program for prescribers and materials for prescribers to educate patients), and a timetable for submission of assessments of at least six months, 12 months, and annually after the REMS is approved. In addition, FDA requested we include a proposal for a risk mitigation strategy in the NDA submission. We proposed elements of a REMS and a post-approval safety trial within the NDA for Gimoti. At this time, the elements of the REMS that FDA will require for Gimoti are uncertain as there are varying levels of requirements that may include a Medication Guide, similar to the Listed Drug, Reglan Tablets 10 mg., and other elements, such as a communication plan and an implementation plan, designed to ensure safe use, as well as a timetable for submission of post-marketing assessments after the REMS is approved.\nIn addition, if Gimoti is approved, the product labeling, advertising and promotion would be subject to regulatory requirements and continuing regulatory review. FDA strictly regulates the promotional claims that may be made about prescription products. In particular, a product may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by FDA as reflected in the product\u2019s approved labeling. If we receive marketing approval for Gimoti, physicians may nevertheless prescribe it to their patients in a manner that is inconsistent with the approved label. If we are found to have promoted such off-label uses, we may become subject to significant liability. FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant sanctions. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has enjoined several companies from engaging in off-label promotion. FDA has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed.\nFDA\u2019s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained, which would adversely affect our business, prospects and ability to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe also cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action, either in the United States or abroad. For example, certain policies of the current administration may impact our business and industry. Namely, several recent executive actions, including the issuance of a number of Executive Orders, could impose significant burdens on, or otherwise materially delay, FDA\u2019s ability to engage in routine regulatory and oversight activities such as implementing statutes through rulemaking, issuance of guidance, and review and approval of marketing applications. It is difficult to predict how these executive actions, including the Executive Orders, will be implemented, and the extent to which they will impact FDA\u2019s ability to exercise its regulatory authority. If these executive actions impose constraints on FDA\u2019s ability to engage in oversight and implementation activities in the normal course, our business may be negatively impacted.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval for Gimoti, we still may not be able to successfully commercialize it and the revenue that we generate from its sales, if any, will be limited.\nGimoti\u2019s commercial success will depend upon the acceptance of the product candidate by the medical community, including physicians, patients and health care payors. The degree of market acceptance of our product candidate will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\ndemonstration of clinical efficacy and safety compared to other more-established products;\n\u2022\nthe limitation of our targeted patient population to women-only;\n\u2022\nlimitations or warnings contained in any FDA-approved labeling, including the potential boxed warning on all metoclopramide product labels concerning the chance of TD for patients taking these products, or any limitations with respect to metoclopramide product labels in the EU;\n\u2022\nacceptance of a new formulation by health care providers and their patients;\n\u2022\nthe prevalence and severity of any adverse effects;\n\u2022\nnew procedures or methods of treatment that may be more effective in treating or may reduce the incidences of diabetic gastroparesis;\n\u2022\npricing and cost-effectiveness;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our, Eversana\u2019s, or any future collaborators\u2019 sales and marketing strategies and execution;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain and maintain sufficient third-party coverage and reimbursement from government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and other third-party payors; and\n\u2022\nthe willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of third-party coverage.\nIf Gimoti is approved, but does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, health care payors and patients, we may not generate sufficient revenue, and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability. Our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of Gimoti may require significant resources and may never be successful. In addition, our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidate will depend on our ability to manufacture our products, differentiate our products from competing products and defend the intellectual property of our products.\nIt will be difficult for us to profitably sell Gimoti if coverage and reimbursement are limited.\nMarket acceptance and sales of our product candidate will depend on coverage and reimbursement policies and may be affected by healthcare reform measures. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities, pharmacy benefit managers and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly, third-party payors have been challenging the prices charged for products. They may also refuse to provide any coverage of uses of approved products for medical indications other than those for which FDA has granted marketing approval. This trend may impact the reimbursement for treatments for GI disorders especially, including Gimoti, as physicians typically focus on symptoms rather than underlying conditions when treating patients with these disorders and drugs are often prescribed for uses outside of their approved indications. In instances where alternative products are available, it may be required that those alternative treatment options are tried before coverage and reimbursement are available for Gimoti. Although Gimoti is a novel nasal spray formulation of metoclopramide, this is the same active ingredient that is already available in other formulations approved for the treatment of gastroparesis that are already widely available at generic prices. We cannot be sure that coverage will be available for Gimoti and, if coverage is available, the level of reimbursement. Reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, this product candidate. In addition, in certain foreign countries, particularly the countries of the EU, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control.\nIf reimbursement is not available or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our product candidate.\nWe rely and will continue to rely on outsourcing arrangements for many of our activities, including pre-commercialization activities, regulatory submissions and supply of Gimoti.\nAs of February 29, 2020, we had only five full-time employees and, as a result, we rely on outsourcing arrangements with third-party vendors for a significant portion of our activities, including pre-commercial sales and marketing, data analysis, assistance with ongoing regulatory discussions and submissions supporting the Gimoti NDA, manufacturing, and the functions required of being a public company. Any failure of our third-party vendors to continue their support could adversely affect our ability to respond to issues raised by FDA\u2019s review of the NDA and our ability to commercialize Gimoti, if approved.\nThe manufacture of pharmaceutical products requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of any component of Gimoti, including metoclopramide, the nasal spray device or associated bottle, nor do we have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. We currently depend on third-party contract manufacturers for all of our required raw materials, drug substance and drug product for our clinical trials and pre-commercialization activities, and will continue to rely on such third parties for commercial production if Gimoti is approved for marketing. We are currently using, and relying on, single suppliers and single manufacturers for starting materials, the final drug substance and nasal spray delivery device for Gimoti, including Cosma as the sole-source supplier of metoclopramide and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., as the sole manufacturer of Gimoti. Although potential alternative suppliers and manufacturers for some components have been identified, we have not qualified these vendors to date. If we were required to change vendors, it could result in a failure to meet regulatory requirements or projected timelines and necessary quality standards for successful manufacturing of the various required lots of material for our development and commercialization efforts.\nIf we change to other manufacturers in the future, FDA and comparable foreign regulators must approve these manufacturers\u2019 facilities and processes prior to use, which could require new clinical studies, testing and compliance inspections, and the new manufactures would have to be educated in, or demonstrate successful technology transfer of, the processes necessary for the production of Gimoti.\nIn addition, our reliance on third-party vendors and contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, entails further risks including:\n\u2022\nnon-compliance by third parties with regulatory and quality control standards;\n\u2022\nbreach by third parties of our agreements with them;\n\u2022\ntermination or non-renewal of an agreement with third parties; and\n\u2022\nsanctions imposed by regulatory authorities if compounds supplied or manufactured by a third-party supplier or manufacturer fail to comply with applicable regulatory standards.\nAny performance failure on the part of our third-party manufacturers could delay commercialization and we may be required to replace such manufacturers, and we may be unable to replace them on a timely basis or at all. Further, our third-party manufacturers may experience manufacturing difficulties due to resource constraints or as a result of natural disasters, labor disputes, unstable political environments, or public health emergencies such as the recent coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak. If our third-party manufacturers were to encounter any manufacturing difficulties or delays due to these factors, our ability to provide Gimoti for treatment of patients if approved by FDA, would be jeopardized.\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others selling their products more effectively than we do, and in others discovering, developing or commercializing product candidates before, or more successfully, than we do.\nOur future success depends on our ability to demonstrate and maintain a competitive advantage with respect to the design, development and commercialization of Gimoti. We anticipate that Gimoti, if approved, would compete directly with metoclopramide, erythromycin and domperidone, each of which is available under various trade names sold by several major pharmaceutical companies, including generic manufacturers. Metoclopramide is the only molecule currently approved in the United States to treat gastroparesis. Metoclopramide is generically-available and indicated for the relief of symptoms associated with acute and recurrent diabetic gastroparesis, without the limitation of use in women only.\nMany of our potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and personnel resources than we have. In addition, many of these competitors have significantly greater commercial infrastructures than we have. We will not be able to compete successfully unless we successfully:\n\u2022\nassure health care providers, patients and health care payors that Gimoti is beneficial compared to other products in the market;\n\u2022\nobtain patent and/or other proprietary protection for Gimoti;\n\u2022\nobtain and maintain required regulatory approvals for Gimoti; and\n\u2022\ncollaborate with others to effectively market, sell and distribute Gimoti.\nEstablished competitors may invest heavily to quickly discover and develop novel compounds that could make our product candidate obsolete. In addition to our Gimoti product candidate, we are aware of other development candidates in clinical development. Any of these product candidates could advance through clinical development faster than Gimoti and, if approved, could attain faster and greater market acceptance than our product candidate. If we are not able to compete effectively against our current and future competitors, our business will not grow and our financial condition and operations will suffer.\nIf we fail to attract and retain senior management and key commercial personnel, we may be unable to successfully complete the development of Gimoti and commercialize this product candidate.\nOur success depends in part on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified management, clinical and commercial personnel. We are highly dependent upon our senior management team composed of three individuals: David A. Gonyer, R.Ph., our President and Chief Executive Officer, Matthew J. D\u2019Onofrio, our Executive Vice President and Chief Business Officer, and Marilyn Carlson, D.M.D., M.D., our Chief Medical Officer. The loss of services of any of these individuals could delay or prevent the successful development of Gimoti or the commercialization of this product candidate, if approved.\nWe may need to hire and retain qualified personnel to pursue the potential commercialization of Gimoti. We could experience problems in the future attracting and retaining qualified employees. For example, competition for qualified personnel in the biotechnology and pharmaceuticals field is intense, particularly in the San Diego, California area where we are headquartered. We may not be able to attract and retain quality personnel on acceptable terms who have the expertise we need to sustain and grow our business.\nWe may encounter difficulties in managing our growth and expanding our operations successfully.\nBecause we only had five full-time employees as of February 29, 2020, we may need to grow our organization to pursue the potential commercialization of Gimoti and to potentially conduct additional unplanned development activities. As we seek to commercialize Gimoti, we will need to expand our regulatory, finance, manufacturing, marketing and sales capabilities or contract with third parties to provide these capabilities for us. As our operations expand, we expect that we will need to manage additional relationships with various strategic partners, suppliers and other third parties. Future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management and require us to retain additional internal capabilities. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize Gimoti and to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth effectively. To that end, we must be able to manage our development efforts and clinical trials effectively and hire, train and integrate additional management, clinical and regulatory, financial, administrative and sales and marketing personnel. We may not be able to accomplish these tasks, and our failure to accomplish any of them could prevent us from successfully growing our company.\nEnacted and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize Gimoti and affect the prices we may obtain.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval for Gimoti, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell our product candidate, assuming we obtain marketing approval.\nLegislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We are not sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of Gimoti, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of FDA\u2019s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.\nIn 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act, was signed into law. The Affordable Care Act was intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, increased the Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program for both branded and generic drugs and revised the definition of \u201caverage manufacturer price\u201d for reporting purposes, which could further increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates to states. Further, the law imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products, increased the number of entities eligible for discounts under the 340B program and included a discount on brand name drugs for Medicare Part D beneficiaries in the coverage gap, or \u201cdonut hole.\u201d Substantial provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may require us to modify our business practices with healthcare practitioners.\nSince its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or Tax Act, was enacted, which, among other things, removes penalties for not complying with Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate to carry health insurance. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the Affordable Care Act, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are invalid as well. On December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for\nthe 5th Circuit upheld the District Court\u2019s decision that the individual mandate was unconstitutional but remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are invalid as well. It is unclear how these decisions, subsequent appeals, if any, and other efforts to challenge, repeal or replace the Affordable Care Act will impact the law. We cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or the impact of potential legislation on us.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of two percent per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013, and due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2029, unless additional Congressional action is taken and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Recently there has also been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed to, among other things, reform government program reimbursement methodologies. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. These laws and the regulations and policies implementing them, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to successfully develop and commercialize our products, if approved.\nIf we or our commercialization partners market products in a manner that violates healthcare laws, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties.\nIn addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal healthcare fraud and abuse laws have been applied in recent years to restrict business activities in the pharmaceutical industry, including certain marketing practices. These laws include false claims, anti-kickback, data privacy and security and physician payment transparency laws and regulations. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the safe harbors, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of these laws.\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are several statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability. Further a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them in order to have committed a violation.\nFederal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the False Claims Act, prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid. Violations of the False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. Over the past few years, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for a variety of alleged promotional and marketing activities, such as: allegedly providing free trips, free goods, sham consulting fees and grants and other monetary benefits to prescribers; reporting to pricing services inflated average wholesale prices that were then used by federal programs to set reimbursement rates; engaging in off-label promotion that caused claims to be submitted to Medicaid for non-covered, off-label uses; and submitting inflated best price information to the Medicaid Rebate Program to reduce liability for Medicaid rebates. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act. Most states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.\nFederal civil monetary penalties laws impose civil fines for, among other things, the offering or transfer of remuneration to a Medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary\u2019s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state healthcare program, unless an exception applies.\nHIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.\nFederal price reporting laws require manufactures to calculate and report complex pricing metrics to government programs, where such reported prices may be used in the calculation of reimbursement and/or discounts on approved products.\nFederal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers.\nOnce our products are approved and we commence sales in the United States, we will also be required to comply with the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the government information related to payments or other \u201ctransfers of value\u201d made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain other health care professionals beginning in 2022, and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations to report annually to the government ownership and investment interests held by physicians (as defined above) and their immediate family members. Manufacturers are required to report such data to the government by the 90th calendar day of each year. There are also several states with similar laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and pricing information, and/or require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers.\nThe risk of our being found in violation of these laws and regulations is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from governmental health care programs, a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance, individual imprisonment, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.\nWe may be subject to foreign, federal, and state data privacy and security laws, and failure to protect our information systems against security breaches, service interruptions, or misappropriation of data could disrupt operations, compromise sensitive data, and expose us to liability, possibly causing our business and reputation to suffer.\nWe may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by HITECH and its implementing regulations, imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA\u2019s security standards directly applicable to business associates, independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys\u2019 fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. Even when HIPAA does not apply, according to the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers\u2019 personal information secure constitutes unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, or FTCA, 15 U.S.C \u00a7 45(a). The FTC expects a company\u2019s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Individually identifiable health information is considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards. The FTC\u2019s guidance for appropriately securing consumers\u2019 personal information is similar to what is required by the HIPAA Security Rule.\nCertain state laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. For example, California recently enacted legislation, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which went into effect January 1, 2020. The CCPA, among other things, creates new data privacy obligations for covered companies and provides new privacy rights to California residents, including the right to opt out of certain disclosures of their information. The CCPA also creates a private right of action with statutory damages for certain data breaches, thereby potentially increasing risks associated with a data breach. Although the law includes limited exceptions, including for \u201cprotected health information\u201d maintained by a covered entity or business associate, it may regulate or impact our processing of personal information depending on the context.\nSimilar healthcare laws and regulations exist in the EU and other jurisdictions, including reporting requirements detailing interactions with and payments to healthcare providers and requirements regarding the collection, distribution, use, security, and storage of personally identifiable information and other data relating to individuals, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679, or GDPR, which went into effect in May 2018. The GDPR applies to any company established in the EU as well as to those outside the EU if they collect and use personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to individuals in the EU or the monitoring of their behavior. Companies that must comply with the GDPR face increased compliance obligations and risk, including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance of up to \u20ac20 million or 4%\nof the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. The GDPR provides that EU member states may introduce further conditions, including limitations, to the processing of genetic, biometric or health data, which could limit our ability to collect, use and share personal data, or could cause our compliance costs to increase, ultimately having an adverse impact on our business. In addition, the United Kingdom leaving the EU could also lead to further legislative and regulatory changes. It remains unclear how the United Kingdom data protection laws or regulations will develop in the medium to longer term and how data transfer to the United Kingdom from the EU will be regulated, especially following the United Kingdom's departure from the EU on January 31, 2020 without a deal. However, the United Kingdom has transposed the GDPR into domestic law with the Data Protection Act 2018, which remains in force following the United Kingdom's departure from the EU.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of Gimoti.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability as a result of the clinical testing of Gimoti and will face an even greater risk if we commercialize the product candidate. For example, we may be sued if Gimoti allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product candidate, negligence, strict liability and a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts.\nIn particular, products containing metoclopramide have been reported to cause side effects, including TD. It is possible that a patient taking Gimoti will be found to experience a variety of side effects. In 2009, FDA required a boxed warning on all metoclopramide product labels concerning the chance of TD for patients taking these products. We expect that the label for Gimoti, if approved, will likely contain a similar warning regarding TD. Several manufactures of metoclopramide products have been sued by patients regarding TD.\nIf we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our product candidate. Even successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for Gimoti;\n\u2022\ninjury to our reputation;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022\ncosts to defend the related litigation;\n\u2022\na diversion of management\u2019s time and our resources;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u2022\nproduct recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u2022\nloss of revenue;\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize Gimoti; and\n\u2022\na decline in our stock price.\nWe may form strategic alliances in the future, and we may not realize the benefits of such alliances.\nWe may form strategic alliances, create joint ventures or collaborations or enter into licensing arrangements with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our existing business, including for the continued development or commercialization of Gimoti. These relationships or those like them may require us to incur non-recurring and other charges, increase our near- and long-term expenditures, issue securities that dilute our existing stockholders or disrupt our management and business. In addition, we face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners and the negotiation process is time-consuming and complex. Moreover, we may not be successful in our efforts to establish a strategic partnership or other alternative arrangements for Gimoti because third parties may view the development or commercialization risk of Gimoti as too significant or the commercial opportunity for our product candidate as too limited. We cannot be certain that, following a strategic transaction or license, we will achieve the revenues or specific net income that justifies such transaction.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures, including cyberattacks.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our current and any future CROs and other contractors and consultants and collaborators are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. While we have not experienced any such material system failure, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our development program for Gimoti and our business operations. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Likewise, we rely on third parties to manufacture Gimoti and conduct clinical trials, and similar events relating to their computer systems could also have a material adverse effect on our business. To the extent that any disruption or\nsecurity breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development and commercialization of our product candidate could be delayed, or otherwise adversely affected.\nBusiness disruptions could seriously harm our future revenues and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nOur operations could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, water shortages, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics and other natural or manmade disasters or business interruptions, for which we are predominantly self-insured. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm our operations and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. We rely on third-party manufacturers to produce our Gimoti. Our ability to obtain clinical supplies of Gimoti could be disrupted, if the operations of these suppliers are affected by a man-made or natural disaster or other business interruption. For example, in December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (Covid-19), has resulted in business closures and a limit on travel, as well as creating uncertainty in the broader economy and financial markets. At this point, the extent to which Covid-19, and any measures taken by governments of the countries affected, may impact our results is uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nOur operations are located in Solana Beach, California near major earthquake faults and fire zones. The ultimate impact on us, our significant suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and fire zones and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown, but our operations and financial condition could suffer in the event of a major earthquake, fire or other natural disaster, or public health emergency.\nIf we fail to develop and commercialize other product candidates, we may be unable to grow our business.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we plan to evaluate the development and/or commercialization of other therapies for GI motility disorders. Similar to our initial focus on gastroparesis, we will evaluate opportunities to in-license or acquire other product candidates as well as commercial products to treat patients suffering from predominantly GI disorders, seeking to identify areas of high unmet medical needs with limited treatment options. These other product candidates will require additional, time-consuming development efforts prior to commercial sale, including preclinical studies, extensive clinical trials and approval by FDA and applicable foreign regulatory authorities. All product candidates are prone to the risks of failure that are inherent in pharmaceutical product development, including the possibility that the drug candidate will not be shown to be sufficiently safe and/or effective for approval by regulatory authorities. In addition, we cannot assure you that any such products that are approved will be manufactured or produced economically, successfully commercialized or widely accepted in the marketplace or be more effective than other commercially available alternatives.\nIf we engage in an acquisition, reorganization or business combination, we will incur a variety of risks that could adversely affect our business operations or our stockholders.\nFrom time to time we have considered, and we will continue to consider in the future, strategic business initiatives intended to further the development of our business. These initiatives may include acquiring businesses, technologies or products or entering into a business combination with another company. If we do pursue such a strategy, we could, among other things:\n\u2022\nissue equity securities that would dilute our current stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership;\n\u2022\nincur substantial debt that may place strains on our operations;\n\u2022\nspend substantial operational, financial and management resources in integrating new businesses, technologies and products; and\n\u2022\nassume substantial actual or contingent liabilities.\nWe may be unable to maintain sufficient product liability insurance.\nOur inability to obtain and retain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of products we develop. We currently carry product liability insurance covering our clinical studies. Although we maintain such insurance, any claim that may be brought against us could result in a court judgment or settlement in an amount that is not covered, in whole or in part, by our insurance or that is in excess of the limits of our insurance coverage. If we determine that it is prudent to increase our product liability coverage due to the commercial launch of any product, we may be unable to obtain such increased coverage on acceptable terms or at all. Our insurance policies also have various exclusions, and we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no coverage. We will have to pay any amounts awarded by a court or negotiated in a settlement that exceed our coverage limitations or that are not covered by our insurance, and we may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient capital to pay such amounts.\nRisks Relating to Our Intellectual Property\nIt is difficult and costly to protect our intellectual property rights, and we cannot ensure the protection of these rights. Any impairment of our intellectual property rights may materially affect our business.\nWe place considerable importance on obtaining patent protection for new technologies, products and processes because our commercial success will depend, in large part, on obtaining patent protection for new technologies, products and processes,\nsuccessfully defending these patents against third-party challenges and successfully enforcing our patents against third-party competitors. To that end, we have acquired and will file applications for patents covering formulations containing or uses of Gimoti or our proprietary processes as well as other intellectual property important to our business. One of our patent families related to Gimoti was acquired from Questcor, which was acquired by Mallinckrodt in August 2014. The method of use patents in this patent family were not written by us or our attorneys, and we did not have control over the drafting and prosecution of these patents. Further, Questcor and other predecessors might not have given the same attention to the drafting and prosecution of these patents as we would have if we had been the owners of the patents and application and had control over the drafting and prosecution.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions for which legal principles remain unresolved. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. In recent years patent rights have been the subject of significant litigation, in particular due to inter partes review, introduced by the America Invents Act of 2012, which allows for quicker patent challenges decided by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office\u2019s, or USPTO, Patent Trial and Appeal Board rather than a lay jury. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. The laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we or our predecessors were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned and licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we or our predecessors were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions One or more of these factors could possibly result in findings of invalidity or unenforceability of one or more of the patents we own.\nWith respect to challenges to the validity of our patents, for example, there might be invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on a product candidate. Even if a defendant does not prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, our patent claims may be construed in a manner that would limit our ability to enforce such claims against the defendant and others. The cost of defending such a challenge, particularly in a foreign jurisdiction, and any resulting loss of patent protection could have a material adverse impact on one or more of our product candidates and our business.\nEnforcing our intellectual property rights against third parties may also cause such third parties to file other counterclaims against us, which could be costly to defend, particularly in a foreign jurisdiction, and could require us to pay substantial damages, cease the sale of certain products or enter into a license agreement and pay royalties (which may not be possible on commercially reasonable terms or at all). Any efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights are also likely to be costly and may divert the efforts of our scientific and management personnel.\nThe patent rights we own covering Gimoti are directed to specific methods of use and formulations of metoclopramide. As a result, our ability to prevent others from marketing products related to Gimoti may be limited by the lack of patent protection for the active ingredient itself and other metoclopramide formulations may be developed by competitors. The active ingredient in Gimoti is metoclopramide. No patent protection is available for metoclopramide itself. As a result, competitors who develop and receive required regulatory approval for competing products using the same active ingredient as Gimoti may market their competing products so long as they do not infringe any of the method or formulation patents owned by us.\nThird parties may seek approval to market their own products similar to or otherwise competitive with our product candidates. In these circumstances, we may need to defend or assert our patents, including by filing lawsuits alleging patent infringement. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. In any of these types of proceedings, a court or agency with jurisdiction may find our patents invalid or unenforceable. Even if we have valid and enforceable patents, these patents still may not provide protection against competing products or processes sufficient to achieve our business objectives. Even after they have issued, our patents and any patents that we license may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented. If our patents are invalidated or otherwise limited or will expire prior to the commercialization of our product candidates, other companies may be better able to develop products that compete with ours, which could adversely affect our competitive business position, business prospects and financial condition. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates. The following are examples of litigation and other adversarial proceedings or disputes that we could become a party to involving our patents or patents licensed to us:\n\u2022\nwe may initiate litigation or other proceedings against third parties to enforce our patent and trade secret rights;\n\u2022\nthird parties may initiate litigation or other proceedings seeking to invalidate patents owned by or licensed to us or to obtain a declaratory judgment that their product or technology does not infringe our patents or patents licensed to us;\n\u2022\nthird parties may initiate opposition or reexamination proceedings challenging the validity or scope of our patent rights, requiring us to participate in such proceedings to defend the validity and scope of our patents;\n\u2022\nthere may be a challenge or dispute regarding inventorship or ownership of patents or trade secrets currently identified as being owned by or licensed to us;\n\u2022\nthe USPTO may initiate an interference between patents or patent applications owned by or licensed to us and those of our competitors, requiring us to participate in an interference proceeding to determine the priority of invention, which could jeopardize our patent rights; or\n\u2022\nthird parties may seek approval to market similar versions of our future approved products prior to expiration of relevant patents owned by or licensed to us, requiring us to defend our patents, including by filing lawsuits alleging patent infringement.\nThese lawsuits and proceedings would be costly and could affect our results of operations and divert the attention of our managerial and scientific personnel. Adversaries in these proceedings may have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to prosecuting these legal actions than we or our licensors can. There is a risk that a court or administrative body would decide that our patents are invalid or not infringed or trade secrets not misappropriated by a third party\u2019s activities, or that the scope of certain issued claims must be further limited. An adverse outcome in a litigation or proceeding involving our own patents or trade secrets could limit our ability to assert our patents or trade secrets against these or other competitors, affect our ability to receive royalties or other licensing consideration from any licensees, and may curtail or preclude our ability to exclude third parties from making, using and selling similar or competitive products. Any of these occurrences could adversely affect our competitive business position, business prospects and financial condition. We may not be able to prevent, alone or with our licensors, infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States. Any litigation or other proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights may fail, and even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have an adverse effect on the price of our common shares. The degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage. For example:\n\u2022\nthird parties may seek approval to market similar versions of our future approved products prior to expiration of relevant patents owned by or licensed to us, requiring us to defend our patents, including by filing lawsuits alleging patent infringement.\n\u2022\nothers may be able to develop a platform that is similar to, or better than, ours in a way that is not covered by the claims of our patents;\n\u2022\nothers may be able to make products that are similar to our product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of our patents;\n\u2022\nwe might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by patents or pending patent applications or we might not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u2022\nany patents that we obtain may not provide us with any competitive advantages or may ultimately be found invalid or unenforceable; or\n\u2022\nwe may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable or that afford meaningful trade secret protection.\nOthers have filed, and in the future are likely to file, patent applications covering products and technologies that are similar, identical or competitive to ours, or important to our business. We cannot be certain that any patent application owned by a third party will not have priority over patent applications filed or in-licensed by us, or that we will not be involved in interference, opposition or invalidity proceedings before U.S. or foreign patent offices.\nWe have focused our intellectual property efforts on the United States. To the extent that our patent portfolio differs from country to country outside the United States, this may make protecting Gimoti as a product outside the United States even more difficult and unpredictable. Various countries maintain their own standards and interpretation of intellectual property law, potentially creating additional patent risk beyond even that experienced within the United States.\nWe also rely on trade secrets to protect technology in cases when we believe patent protection is not appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. While we require employees, consultants and other contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements, we may not be able to adequately protect our trade secrets or other proprietary information. Our research collaborators and scientific advisors may have rights to publish data and information in which we have rights. If we cannot maintain the confidentiality of our technology and other confidential information in connection with our collaborators and advisors, our ability to receive patent protection or protect our proprietary information may be imperiled.\nClaims by third parties that we infringe their proprietary rights may result in liability for damages or prevent or delay our developmental and commercialization efforts.\nThe biotechnology industry has been characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Because patent applications are maintained in secrecy until the application is published, we may be unaware of third-party patent applications which may issue as patents that may be infringed by commercialization of Gimoti. In addition, identification of third-party patent rights that may be relevant to our technology is difficult because patent searching is imperfect due to differences in terminology among patents, incomplete databases and the difficulty in assessing the meaning of patent claims. Any claims of patent infringement asserted by third parties would be time consuming and would likely:\n\u2022\nresult in costly litigation;\n\u2022\ndivert the time and attention of our technical personnel and management;\n\u2022\ncause development delays;\n\u2022\nprevent us from commercializing Gimoti until the asserted patent expires or is held finally invalid or not infringed in a court of law;\n\u2022\nrequire us to develop non-infringing technology; and/or\n\u2022\nrequire us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements.\nAlthough no third party has asserted a claim of infringement against us, others may hold proprietary rights that could prevent Gimoti from being marketed. Any patent-related legal action against us claiming damages or seeking to enjoin commercial activities relating to our product candidate or processes could subject us to potential liability for damages and could require us to obtain a license to continue to manufacture or market Gimoti, or, if no such license were available on commercially viable terms, could require us to cease manufacturing and marketing of Gimoti. We cannot predict whether we would prevail in any such actions or that any license required under any of these patents would be made available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, we cannot be sure that we could redesign our product candidate or processes to avoid infringement, if necessary. Accordingly, an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding, or the failure to obtain necessary licenses, could prevent us from developing and commercializing Gimoti, which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Whatever the outcome, any patent litigation would be costly and time consuming, could be distracting to our management, and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may be subject to claims that we have wrongfully hired an employee from a competitor or that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged confidential information or trade secrets of their former employers.\nAs is commonplace in our industry, we employ and consult with individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although no claims against us are currently pending, we may be subject in the future to claims that our employees or consultants are subject to a continuing obligation to their former employers or clients (such as non-competition or non-solicitation obligations) or claims that our employees, our consultants or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers or clients. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nChanges in patent laws or patent jurisprudence could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products.\nThe patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. Changes in either the patent laws or in the interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property. We cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or found to be enforceable in our patents, in our strategic partners\u2019 patents or in third-party patents. The United States has enacted and is currently implementing wide-ranging patent reform legislation. Further, recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have either narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the validity, scope and value of patents, once obtained.\nFor our U.S. patent applications containing a priority claim after March 16, 2013, there is a greater level of uncertainty in the patent law. In September 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, also known as the America Invents Act, or AIA, was signed into law. The AIA includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law, including provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation.\nThe AIA and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have an adverse effect on our business. An important change introduced by the AIA is that, as of March 16, 2013, the United States transitioned to a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system for deciding which party should be granted a patent when two or more patent applications are filed by different parties disclosing or claiming the same invention. A third party that has filed, or does file a patent application in the USPTO after March 16, 2013 but before us, could be\nawarded a patent covering a given invention, even if we had made the invention before it was made by the third party. This requires us to be cognizant going forward of the time from invention to filing of a patent application.\nAmong some of the other changes introduced by the AIA are changes that limit where a patentee may file a patent infringement suit and providing opportunities for third parties to challenge any issued patent in the USPTO. This applies to all of our U.S. patents, even those issued before March 16, 2013. Because of a lower evidentiary standard in USPTO proceedings compared to the evidentiary standard in United States federal court necessary to invalidate a patent claim, a third party could potentially provide evidence in a USPTO proceeding sufficient for the USPTO to hold a claim invalid even though the same evidence would be insufficient to invalidate the claim if first presented in a district court action. Accordingly, a third party may attempt to use the USPTO procedures to invalidate our patent claims that would not have been invalidated if first challenged by the third party as a defendant in a district court action.\nDepending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the U.S. federal courts, the USPTO or similar authorities in foreign jurisdictions, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that may weaken our and our licensors\u2019 ability to obtain new patents or to enforce existing patents we and our licensors or partners may obtain in the future.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our current or future products, if any, and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing. Recent United States Supreme Court cases have narrowed the scope of what is considered patentable subject matter, for example, in the areas of software and diagnostic methods involving the association between treatment outcome and biomarkers. This could impact our ability to patent certain aspects of our technology in the United States.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license. Additionally, the requirements for patentability may differ in certain countries, particularly developing countries. For example, unlike other countries, China has a heightened requirement for patentability, and specifically requires a detailed description of medical uses of a claimed drug. In India, unlike the United States, there is no link between regulatory approval of a drug and its patent status. In addition to India, certain countries in Europe and developing countries, including China, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In those countries, we and our licensors may have limited remedies if patents are infringed or if we or our licensors are compelled to grant a license to a third party, which could materially diminish the value of those patents. This could limit our potential revenue opportunities. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we own or license.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Capital\nOur recurring losses from operations have raised substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur recurring losses from operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, and as a result, management concluded that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our independent registered public accounting firm also included an explanatory paragraph in its report on our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 with respect to this uncertainty. This doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern could materially limit our ability to raise additional funds through the issuance of new debt or equity securities or otherwise. In addition, the perception that we may not be able to continue as a going concern may cause others to choose not to deal with us due to concerns about our ability to meet our contractual obligations. Future reports on our financial statements may also include an explanatory paragraph with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern. We have incurred significant losses since our inception and have never been profitable, and it is possible we will never achieve profitability. We have devoted our resources to developing Gimoti, but it cannot be marketed until regulatory approvals have been obtained.\nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception. On January 17, 2020, we received a notice from FDA that it had accepted our NDA resubmission for review and set a target goal date for a decision under PDUFA of June 19, 2020. We believe, based on our current operating plan, that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations through the PDUFA target goal date and into the third quarter of 2020. If Gimoti is approved by FDA, additional funds will become available from the Eversana Credit Facility which we believe, based on our current operating plan, will provide sufficient cash to fund our operations into 2021 excluding any potential future Gimoti product revenue. This period could be shortened if there are any significant increases in planned spending other than anticipated. Even with the Eversana Credit Facility, we will be required to raise additional funds in order to continue as a going concern. There is no assurance that other financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all, when needed to allow us to continue as a going concern. There can be no assurance that we will be able to further develop Gimoti, if required. Because our business is entirely dependent on the success of Gimoti, if we are unable to secure additional financing or identify and execute on other development or strategic alternatives for Gimoti or our company, we will be required to curtail all of our activities and may be required to liquidate, dissolve or otherwise wind down our operations. Any of these events could result in a complete loss of your investment in our securities.\nWe have incurred significant operating losses since inception, and we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future. We may never become profitable or, if achieved, be able to sustain profitability.\nWe have incurred significant operating losses since we were founded in 2007 and expect to incur significant losses for the next several years related to completing development for Gimoti, and seeking regulatory approval from FDA to manufacture and commercialize Gimoti. Our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2019, was approximately $7.1 million. As of December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $85.7 million. Losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in our clinical trials, research and development programs and from our general and administrative expenses, especially since we became a public company in September 2013. In the future, we intend to continue to conduct research and development, clinical testing, regulatory compliance activities as needed and, if Gimoti is approved, sales and marketing activities that, together with anticipated general and administrative expenses, will likely result in our incurring further significant losses for the next several years.\nWe currently generate no revenue from sales, and we may never be able to commercialize Gimoti or other marketable drugs. As a result, there can be no assurance that we will ever generate revenues or achieve profitability, which could impair our ability to sustain operations or obtain any required additional funding. If we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods.\nIf we fail to obtain the capital necessary to fund our operations, we will be unable to successfully develop and commercialize Gimoti.\nWe will require substantial additional future capital in order to finance any additional development activities for Gimoti, including any requirements requested by FDA, including our response to the approvability issues raised by FDA in the CRL, as well as for pre-commercial activities, including marketing and manufacturing of Gimoti. The amount and timing of any expenditure needed to implement our development and commercialization programs will depend on numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe need for, and the progress, costs and results of, any additional clinical trials of Gimoti required by FDA, including any additional trials FDA or other regulatory agencies may require evaluating the safety of Gimoti;\n\u2022\nthe outcome, costs and timing of seeking and obtaining regulatory approvals from FDA, and any similar regulatory agencies;\n\u2022\nthe timing and costs associated with manufacturing Gimoti for clinical trials and other studies and, if approved, for commercial sale;\n\u2022\nour need and ability to hire additional management, development and scientific personnel;\n\u2022\nthe cost to maintain, expand and defend the scope of our intellectual property portfolio, including the amount and timing of any payments we may be required to make, or that we may receive, in connection with licensing, filing, prosecution, defense and enforcement of any patents or other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nthe timing and costs associated with establishing sales and marketing capabilities;\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of Gimoti;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which we are required to pay milestone or other payments under our Mallinckrodt asset purchase agreement and the timing of such payments;\n\u2022\nthe costs of acquiring, licensing or investing in additional businesses, products, product candidates and technologies; and\n\u2022\nour need to implement additional internal systems and infrastructure, including financial and reporting systems.\nSome of these factors are outside of our control. We cannot provide any assurance that our existing capital will be sufficient to enable us to fund any additional clinical development required for Gimoti, and, in any event, we will need to raise additional capital to complete such clinical development, as well as to prepare to commercialize Gimoti should we receive product approval. We may need to raise additional funds in the near future for commercialization for Gimoti.\nWe may seek additional funding through collaboration agreements, public or private equity financings, debt financings or receivables financings. For example, we currently may sell from time to time, at our option, up to an aggregate of $16.0 million of shares of our common stock through B. Riley FBR, Inc., or FBR, as sales agent pursuant to a sales agreement, or FBR Sales Agreement. Sales pursuant to the FBR Sales Agreement are registered pursuant to a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 which was declared effective by the SEC on December 28, 2017. As of February 29, 2020, we had sold approximately $10.9 million of shares of our common stock pursuant to the FBR Sales Agreement. However, there can be no assurance that FBR will be successful in consummating future sales based on prevailing market conditions or in the quantities or at the prices that we deem appropriate.\nUnder current SEC regulations, at any time during which the aggregate market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates, or public float, is less than $75 million, the amount we can raise through primary public offerings of securities in any twelve-month period using shelf registration statements, including sales under the FBR Sales Agreement, is limited to an aggregate of one-third of our public float. As of February 29, 2020, our public float was approximately $34.2 million and we had the capacity to issue up to approximately $5.1 million of additional shares of common stock pursuant to the FBR Sales Agreement. If our public float decreases, the amount of securities we may sell under our Form S-3 shelf registration statement will also decrease. In addition, FBR is permitted to terminate the FBR Sales Agreement in its sole discretion upon ten days\u2019 notice, or at any time in certain circumstances, including the occurrence of an event that would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, operations, earnings, properties, condition (financial or otherwise), prospects, stockholders\u2019 equity or results of operations.\nAdditional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders. In addition, the issuance of additional shares by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our shares to decline and dilute the holdings of our existing stockholders. If we raise additional funds by incurring debt, the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations as well as covenants and specific financial ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business.\nIf we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis, if required, we will be unable to complete additional clinical development of Gimoti and may be required to significantly curtail all of our activities. We also could be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or otherwise that may require us to relinquish rights to our product candidate or some of our technologies or otherwise agree to terms unfavorable to us.\nOur ability to use net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain built-in losses to reduce future tax payments is limited by provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, and may be subject to further limitation as a result of the transactions completed in connection with our initial public offering.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d (generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period), the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. As a result of our most recent private placement and other transactions that have occurred over the past three years, we may have experienced an \u201cownership change.\u201d We may also experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. As of December 31, 2019, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $74.5 million and $47.7 million, respectively, and federal research and development credits of approximately $2.3 million which could be limited if we experience an \u201cownership change.\u201d Furthermore, under U.S. tax legislation enacted in December 2017, although the treatment of tax losses generated before December 31, 2017 has generally not changed, tax losses generated in calendar year 2018 and beyond do not expire, but may only offset 80% of our taxable income. This change may require us to pay federal income taxes in future years despite generating a loss for federal income tax purposes in prior years.\nU.S. tax legislation may materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nU.S. tax legislation enacted in December 2017 has significantly changed the U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. corporations, including by reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate, limiting interest deductions, adopting elements of a territorial tax system, imposing a one-time transition tax on all undistributed earnings and profits of certain U.S.-owned foreign corporations, revising the rules governing net operating losses and the rules governing foreign tax credits, and introducing new anti-base erosion provisions. Many of these changes are effective immediately, without any transition periods or grandfathering for existing transactions. The legislation is unclear in many respects and could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, as well as interpretations and implementing regulations by the Treasury and Internal Revenue Service, any of which could lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation. In addition, it is unclear how these U.S. federal income tax changes will affect state and local taxation, which often uses federal taxable income as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities.\nWhile some of the changes made by the tax legislation may adversely affect us in one or more reporting periods and prospectively, other changes may be beneficial on a going forward basis. We urge our investors to consult with their legal and tax advisors with respect to such legislation.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nAn active trading market for our common stock may not develop or be sustained.\nPrior to our initial public offering in September 2013, there was no public market for our common stock. An active trading market may never develop or be sustained. If an active trading market does not develop or is not sustained, it may be difficult to sell shares of our common stock at a price that is desirable or at all. In addition, an inactive market may impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares and may impair our ability to acquire other companies or technologies by using our shares as consideration, which, in turn, could materially adversely affect our business. Since the commencement of trading in connection with our initial public offering in September 2013 through February 29, 2020, the sale price per share of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market has ranged from a low of $0.50 to a high of $14.25.\nThe price of the shares of our common stock could be highly volatile, and purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nOur stock price is likely to be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. The stock market in general and the market for biotechnology companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, investors may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the price at which they purchased the shares. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u2022\nregulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries;\n\u2022\nthe timing, progress and results of any additional trials we may conduct, and the results of trials of our competitors or those of other companies in our market sector;\n\u2022\nannouncements of the failure to obtain regulatory approval or receipt of another CRL from FDA;\n\u2022\nvariations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022\nchanges in the structure of healthcare payment systems, especially in light of current reforms to the U.S. healthcare system;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nbusiness interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters, such as earthquakes, typhoons, floods and fires, or public health emergencies or pandemics, such as the recent coronavirus\n(Covid-19) outbreak;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors and issuance of securities analysts\u2019 reports or recommendations;\n\u2022\nsales of our stock by insiders and 5% stockholders;\n\u2022\ntrading volume of our common stock;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions other events or factors, many of which are beyond our control;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel; and\n\u2022\nintellectual property, product liability or other litigation against us.\nIn addition, in the past, stockholders have initiated class action lawsuits against biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies following periods of volatility in the market prices of these companies\u2019 stock. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly.\nWe expect our operating results to be subject to quarterly fluctuations. Our net loss and other operating results will be affected by numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nvariations in the level of expenses related to our Gimoti development program, including pre-commercialization costs;\n\u2022\naddition or termination of clinical trials;\n\u2022\nany intellectual property infringement lawsuit in which we may become involved;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments affecting Gimoti; and\n\u2022\nour execution of any collaborative, licensing or similar arrangements, and the timing of payments we may make or receive under these arrangements.\nIf our quarterly operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Furthermore, any quarterly fluctuations in our operating results may, in turn, cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us or a change in our management. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nauthorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nlimiting the removal of directors by the stockholders;\n\u2022\ncreating a staggered board of directors;\n\u2022\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\neliminating the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022\npermitting our board of directors to accelerate the vesting of outstanding option grants upon certain transactions that result in a change of control; and\n\u2022\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us. Although we believe these provisions collectively provide for an opportunity to obtain greater value for stockholders by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if an offer rejected by our board were considered beneficial by some stockholders. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, the ability of our stockholders to achieve a return on their investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common stock and do not currently intend to do so for the foreseeable future. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business. In addition, any future debt financing arrangement may contain terms prohibiting or limiting the amount of dividends that may be declared or paid on our common stock. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the appreciation of their stock. Therefore, the success of an investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in their value. There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders have purchased their shares.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by our existing stockholders in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.\nPersons who were our stockholders prior to the sale of shares in our initial public offering in September 2013 continue to hold a substantial number of shares of our common stock that they are able to sell in the public market, subject in some cases to certain legal restrictions. Significant portions of these shares are held by a small number of stockholders. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise adequate capital through the sale of additional equity securities.\nAs of February 29, 2020, we had 24,431,914 shares of common stock outstanding. All of these shares are freely tradable without restriction in the public market, except for 3,037,375 shares that are held by directors, executive officers and other affiliates that are subject to volume limitations under Rule 144 under the Securities Act. In addition, shares of common stock that are either subject to outstanding options or reserved for future issuance under our employee benefit plans will become eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by the provisions of various vesting schedules and Rule 144 and Rule 701 under the Securities Act. If these additional shares of common stock are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nAs of February 29, 2020, the holders of 1,509,789 shares of our common stock are entitled to reasonable best efforts registration rights with respect to the registration of their shares under the Securities Act. Registration of these shares under the Securities Act would result in the shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act, except for shares held by affiliates, as\ndefined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Any sales of securities by these stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nWe will continue to incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as rules adopted by the SEC and the Nasdaq Stock Market. These rules impose significant requirements on public companies, including requiring establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls, changes in corporate governance practices, proxy access and \u201csay on pay\u201d votes. Stockholder activism, the current political environment and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate.\nThe rules and regulations applicable to public companies have substantially increased our legal and financial compliance costs and made some activities more time-consuming and costly. If these requirements divert the attention of our management and personnel from other business concerns, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The increased costs will decrease our net income or increase our net loss, and may require us to reduce costs in other areas of our business or increase the prices of our products or services. For example, we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. We cannot predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs we may incur to respond to these requirements. The impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers.\nIf securities or industry analysts publish unfavorable research or reports about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. We currently have limited research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases to cover us or fails to regularly publish reports on us, interest in our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nWe could be subject to securities class action litigation.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities. This risk is especially relevant for us because pharmaceutical companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years. If we face such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could harm our business.\nIf we fail to meet all applicable Nasdaq Capital Market requirements and Nasdaq determines to delist our common stock, the delisting could adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock and the market price of our common stock could decrease.\nOur common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market. In order to maintain our listing, we must meet minimum financial and other requirements, including requirements for a minimum amount of capital, a minimum closing bid price per share of $1.00 and continued business operations so that we are not characterized as a \u201cpublic shell company.\u201d\nOn May 15, 2019, we received a letter from Nasdaq indicating that, for the last thirty consecutive business days, the bid price for our common stock had closed below the minimum $1.00 per share requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nIn accordance with Nasdaq listing rules, we were provided an initial period of 180 calendar days, or until November 11, 2019, to regain compliance. The Nasdaq letter had no immediate effect on the listing or trading of our common stock and the common stock continued to trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nWe did not regain compliance with Nasdaq listing rules by November 11, 2019, but Nasdaq provided an additional 180 calendar day compliance period. On November 29, 2019, we received notification from Nasdaq that we regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nIn the event that our common stock is delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market and is not eligible for quotation or listing on another market or exchange, trading of our common stock could be conducted only in the over-the-counter market or on an electronic bulletin board established for unlisted securities such as the Pink Sheets or the OTC Bulletin Board. In such event, it could become more difficult to dispose of, or obtain accurate price quotations for, our common stock, and there would likely also be a reduction in our coverage by securities analysts and the news media, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline further. Also, it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital if we are not listed on a major exchange.", "PERMNO": 14158, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "EVOK"}
