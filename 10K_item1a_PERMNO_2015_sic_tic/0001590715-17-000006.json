{"cik": "1590715", "company": "NGFC Equities, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-01-13", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAlthough we have not yet acquired any gasoline stations or otherwise commenced an active business in our energy and retail division, the following risk factors are expected to affect our business and the industry in which we intend to operate. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us. If any of the matters discussed in the following risk factors were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nAlthough our financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, we must raise additional capital to fund our operations in order to continue as a going concern.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, has included an explanatory paragraph in their opinion that accompanies our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended September 30, 2016, indicating that our current liquidity position raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to improve our liquidity position we may not be able to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result if we are unable to continue as a going concern and, therefore, be required to realize our assets and\ndischarge our liabilities other than in the normal course of business which could cause investors to suffer the loss of all or a substantial portion of their investment.\nWE HAVE ELECTED THE OPT-IN RIGHT FOR EMERGING GROWTH COMPANIES THAT ALLOWS FOR EXEMPTIONS FROM CERTAIN REPORTING STANDARDS AND AS A RESULT, OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE WITH OTHER COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY THAT COMPLY WITH SUCH STANDARDS.\nWe have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the Jobs Act, which allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that currently comply with the new standards.\nWE HAVE A LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY THAT YOU CAN USE TO EVALUATE US, AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF OUR SUCCESS MUST BE CONSIDERED IN LIGHT OF THE PROBLEMS, EXPENSES, DIFFICULTIES, COMPLICATIONS AND DELAYS FREQUENTLY ENCOUNTERED BY A SMALL DEVELOPING COMPANY.\nWe were incorporated in the State of Florida in October 2013. We currently have no significant assets or financial resources. The likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays frequently encountered by a small developing company starting a new business enterprise and the highly competitive environment in which we will operate. Since we have a limited operating history, we cannot assure you that our business will be profitable or that we will ever generate sufficient revenues to meet our expenses and support our anticipated activities.\nWE ARE A HOLDING COMPANY THAT OPERATES BUSINESSES THROUGH OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES. IF WE WERE DEEMED TO BE AN INVESTMENT COMPANY UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940, WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO RESTRUCTURE OUR OPERATIONS, OR TO REGISTER AS AN INVESTMENT COMPANY UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940 AND BECOME SUBJECT TO PROVISIONS OF THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940, WHICH LIKELY WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OF THE COMPANY.\nWe are a holding company planning to operate our business through various subsidiaries with our management actively managing the subsidiaries and thus not a passive investment company. Although we do not believe we will be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, it if is determined that we are an investment company then that would have a material adverse impact on the business activities of the Company. A company is required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, if, among other things, and subject to various exceptions:\n\u00b7\nit is or holds itself out to be engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities; or\n\u00b7\nit is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities, and owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40 per centum of the value of such issuer\u2019s total assets (exclusive of Government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis.\nTHE LIKELIHOOD OF OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE MUST BE CONSIDERED IN LIGHT OF THE PROBLEMS, EXPENSES, DIFFICULTIES, COMPLICATIONS AND DELAYS THAT WE ENCOUNTER, SUCH AS OUR LACK OF BUSINESS AND LACK OF CAPITAL.\nOur lack of business and lack of capital materially threaten our ability to operate. The likelihood of our ability to continue to operate must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays that we encounter, such as our lack of capital. Being a public company may provide us with the ability to raise money\nand finance our operations until and if our revenues increase. But that also brings with it the increase in expenses of maintaining the company. If we are not successful in maintaining our publicly reporting company status and raising the necessary capital to continue to operate, or cannot overcome certain difficulties, complications and delays, such as our lack of capital, we will no longer be able to operate.\nWE WILL NEED ADDITIONAL FINANCING WHICH WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS. ADDITIONAL CAPITAL RAISING EFFORTS IN FUTURE PERIODS MAY BE DILUTIVE TO OUR THEN CURRENT SHAREHOLDERS OR RESULT IN INCREASED INTEREST EXPENSE IN FUTURE PERIODS.\nWe will have to raise additional working capital in order to fully implement our business model. Our future capital requirements, however, depend on a number of factors, including our operations, our ability to grow revenues from other sources, our ability to manage the growth of our business and our ability to control our expenses. If we raise additional capital through the issuance of debt, this will result in increased interest expense. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our company held by existing shareholders will be reduced and those shareholders may experience significant dilution. In addition, new securities may contain certain rights, preferences or privileges that are senior to those of the shares of Common Stock. We cannot assure that we will be able to raise the working capital as needed in the future on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we do not raise funds as needed, we will be unable to fully implement our business model, fund our ongoing operations or grow our company.\nWE HAVE ISSUED A PROMISSORY NOTE TO SOUTHRIDGE PARTNERS II LP (\u201cSOUTHRIDGE\u201d) FOR $50,000 PLUS 7% INTEREST PER ANNUM WITH REFERENCE TO EQUITY LINE WE HAVE WITH THEM THAT HAS TO BE PAID BACK DECEMBER 30, 2016. WE PLAN TO PAY THIS NOTE WITH THE FUNDS WE HAVE CURRENTLY AND FROM THE FUTURE CASH FLOW FROM OUR VARIOUS DIVISIONS. HOWEVER IF WE DO NOT RAISE ADEQUATE CAPITAL FROM THIS OFFERING THAT PAYMENT PLUS OUR OVERHEAD EXPENSES COULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO CONTINUE OUR OPERATIONS AS WE CURRENTLY OPERATE.\nWith reference to a three million dollars ($3,000,000) Equity Line Offering that got effective as of August 9, 2016, we have issued to Southridge a $50,000 promissory note at 7% interest per annum to be paid back on December 30, 2016. We believe we can request an extension to pay back this note although we have no such agreement as of now. We plan to pay this note with our current funds and from our future cash flows. However, we have to depend on the proceeds from that offering or any alternative funding-for which we have no agreements as of now-to continue with our operations. In the event we do not get enough capital from that offering we may have to cease operations since we will not have enough capital to carry on our operations as we conduct them now.\nOUR ENERGY AND RETAIL DIVISION REQUIRE GOVERNMENT REGULATORY APPROVALS AND WILL HAVE TO ABIDE BY ENVIRONMENT REGULATIONS ENFORCED BY THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY IN OPERATING OUR VEHICLE CONVERSION DIVISION, AND WE MAY FIND IT TOO COSTLY OR UNABLE TO GET SUCH CLEARANCE TO SUCCESSFULLY CONDUCT BUSINESS.\nOur business plan anticipates that in the future, the Company will operate a division focused on converting vehicles that currently run on gasoline and diesel to run on NG. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) has complex regulations that we have to abide by in order to conduct the vehicle conversion business. We may find these regulations to be prohibitively costly, possibly requiring us to charge our potential customers higher fees in order to be competitive and profitable. In the event that the EPA regulations are too costly or we do not receive EPA clearance to operate our planned vehicle conversion business, we will not be able to effectively carry out our business plan and our results of operations will be adversely affected.\nOUR MANAGEMENT MAY BE UNABLE TO IDENTIFY LOCATIONS TO BUILD A FUELING AND SERVICE STATION AND/OR EFFECTIVELY INTEGRATE OUR MANAGEMENT STYLE TO OUR FRANCHISEES AND THUS WE MAY BE UNABLE TO FULLY REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF SETTING UP FRANCHISES WHICH MAY AFFECT OUR GROWTH.\nWe are subject to various risks associated with our growth strategy, including the risk that we will be unable to identify suitable locations and franchise partners. Any future expansion plans will be subject to a number of challenges, including:\n\u00b7\nthe diversion of management time and resources and the potential disruption of our ongoing business;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n\u00b7\nunexpected costs and time associated with upgrading both the internal accounting systems as well as educating each of their staffs as to the proper collection and recordation of financial data;\n\u00b7\npotential unknown liabilities associated with franchising operations and the difficulty of retaining key alliances on attractive terms with partners and suppliers; and\n\u00b7\nthe difficulty of retaining and recruiting key personnel and maintaining employee morale.\nWE MAY ACQUIRE BUSINESSES ALREADY IN OPERATION FOR ALL OUR DIVISIONS IN EXCHANGE FOR STOCK OF OUR COMPANY, AND SUCH ACQUISITION EFFORTS IN FUTURE PERIODS MAY BE DILUTIVE TO OUR THEN CURRENT SHAREHOLDERS.\nOur business model may result in the issuance of our securities to consummate certain acquisitions in the future. As a result, the percentage ownership of our company held by existing shareholders will be reduced and those shareholders may experience significant dilution. In addition, new securities may contain certain rights, preferences or privileges that are senior to those of our Common Stock. As our affiliates control a majority of the Company\u2019s voting securities, we will generally not need to solicit our shareholders\u2019 consent before entering into acquisition transactions. Our shareholders are dependent upon the judgment of our management in determining the number and characteristics of any securities issued as consideration in a potential acquisition.\nWE ARE DEPENDENT ON CERTAIN KEY PERSONNEL AND THE LOSS OF THESE KEY PERSONNEL COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nOur success is, to a certain extent, attributable to the management, sales and marketing and operational expertise of key personnel who will perform key functions in the operation of our business. The loss of one or more of these key employees could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and our results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nOUR HEALTH CARE SUBSIDIARY ECI-LATAM INC. HAS ONLY ONE MAJOR CLIENT AND HAS LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY WHICH MAKES IT HARDER TO PROJECT THE FUTURE\nWe acquired ECI-LATAM Inc. (ECIL) in February of 2015. ECIL has been in business only since March 2014 and has a limited operating history. Also so far ECIL has had only one major client and ECIL only maintain medical equipment machinery being manufactured by Getinge Group. These limitations make it difficult to project the future of our single operating subsidiary in our Healthcare Division.\nRISKS SPECIFIC TO OUR ENERGY AND RETAIL INDUSTRY\nWE WILL REQUIRE GOVERNMENT REGULATORY APPROVALS AND WILL HAVE TO ABIDE BY ENVIRONMENT REGULATIONS ENFORCED BY THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY IN OPERATING OUR VEHICLE CONVERSION DIVISION, AND WE MAY FIND IT TOO COSTLY OR UNABLE TO GET SUCH CLEARANCE TO SUCCESSFULLY CONDUCT BUSINESS.\nOur current business plan anticipates the Company operating a division focused on converting vehicles that currently run on gasoline and diesel to run on NG. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) has complex regulations that we have to abide by in order to conduct the vehicle conversion business. We\nmay find these regulations to be prohibitively costly, possibly requiring us to charge our potential customers higher fees in order to be competitive and profitable. In the event that the EPA regulations are too costly or we do not receive EPA clearance to operate our planned vehicle conversion business, we will not be able to effectively carry out our business plan and our results of operations will be adversely affected.\nTHE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS MODEL IS DEPENDENT UPON OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY LOCATIONS THAT WILL GENERATE SUBSTANTIAL NG VEHICLE TRAFFIC IN ORDER TO BUILD AND OPERATE NG SERVICE STATIONS PROFITABLY, EITHER DIRECTLY BY US OR THROUGH FRANCHISEES.\nThe first significant piece of the Company\u2019s business plan is to build and operate NG refueling and service stations to generate revenue. As vehicles in the United States that run on NG are limited, a significant market for our services may not develop as we anticipate. In the event that the NG automobile market does not develop in the United States or we are not able to identify suitable locations for our NG refueling and service stations, we will not be able to effectively carry out our business plan and our results of operations will be adversely affected.\nIF THE PRICES OF CNG AND LNG DO NOT REMAIN SUFFICIENTLY BELOW THE PRICES OF GASOLINE AND DIESEL, POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS WILL HAVE LESS INCENTIVE TO PURCHASE NG VEHICLES, WHICH WOULD DECREASE DEMAND FOR CNG AND LNG AND REDUCE OUR POTENTIAL GROWTH.\nNG vehicles cost more than comparable gasoline or diesel powered vehicles because of the components needed for a vehicle to use NG add to a vehicle\u2019s base cost. If the prices of CNG and LNG do not remain sufficiently below the prices of gasoline or diesel, operators may be unable to recover the additional costs of acquiring or converting to NG vehicles in a timely manner, and they may choose not to use NG vehicles. Our ability to offer CNG and LNG fuel to our customers at lower prices than gasoline and diesel depends in part on NG prices remaining lower, on an energy equivalent basis, than oil prices. If the price of oil, gasoline and diesel declines, it will make it more difficult for us to offer our customers discounted prices for CNG and LNG and maintain an acceptable margin on our sales. Recent and significant volatility in oil and gasoline prices demonstrate that it is difficult to predict future transportation fuel costs. In addition, any new regulations imposed on NG extraction, particularly on extraction of NG from shale formations, could increase the costs of gas production or make it more costly to produce NG, which could lead to substantial increases in the price of NG. Reduced prices for gasoline and diesel fuel may cause potential customers to delay or reject converting their fleets to run on NG. In that event, sales of NG fuel and vehicles would be slowed and our results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nTHE VOLATILITY OF NG PRICES COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE ADOPTION OF CNG AND LNG VEHICLE FUEL AND OUR BUSINESS.\nIn the recent past, the price of NG has been volatile, and this volatility may continue. Increased NG prices affect the cost to us of NG and will adversely impact our projected operating margins in cases where we have committed to sell NG at a fixed price without an effective futures contract in place that fully mitigates the price risk or where we otherwise cannot pass the increased costs on to our customers. In addition, higher NG prices may cause CNG and LNG to cost as much as or more than gasoline and diesel generally, which would adversely impact the adoption of CNG and LNG as a vehicle fuel and consequently our business.\nOUR GROWTH IS INFLUENCED BY GOVERNMENT INCENTIVES AND MANDATES FOR CLEAN BURNING FUELS AND ALTERNATIVE FUEL VEHICLES. THE FAILURE TO PASS NEW LEGISLATION WITH INCENTIVE PROGRAMS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.\nThe NG business is influenced by federal, state and local government tax credits, rebates, grants and similar incentives that promote the use of NG and renewable natural gas (RNG) as a vehicle fuel, as well as bylaws, rules and regulations that require reductions in carbon emissions. The absence of these programs and incentives could have a detrimental effect on the NG vehicle and fueling industry, and as a result our projected revenue and related financial performance may be adversely affected.\nOUR GROWTH DEPENDS IN PART ON ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS AND PROGRAMS MANDATING THE USE OF CLEANER BURNING FUELS, AND MODIFICATION OR REPEAL OF THESE REGULATIONS MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS.\nOur business depends in part on environmental regulations and programs that promote or mandate the use of cleaner burning fuels, including NG and RNG for vehicles. Industry participants with a vested interest in gasoline and diesel, many of which have substantially greater resources than we do, invest significant time and money in an effort to influence environmental regulations in ways that delay or repeal requirements for cleaner vehicle emissions. Further, economic difficulties may result in the delay, amendment or waiver of environmental regulations due to the perception that they impose increased costs on the transportation industry that cannot be absorbed in a challenging economy. The delay, repeal or modification of federal or state regulations or programs that encourage the use of cleaner vehicles could also have a detrimental effect on NG vehicle industry, which, in turn, could slow our growth and adversely affect our business.\nWE FACE INCREASING COMPETITION FROM OIL AND GAS COMPANIES, FUEL PROVIDERS, REFUSE COMPANIES, INDUSTRIAL GAS COMPANIES, NG UTILITIES AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE FAR GREATER RESOURCES AND BRAND AWARENESS THAN US.\nA significant number of established businesses, including oil and gas companies, refuse collectors, NG utilities and their affiliates, industrial gas companies, station owners, fuel providers and other organizations have entered or are planning to enter the NG fuels market. Many of these current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, research and other resources than we have. If we are not able to successfully compete with these entities our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nIF THERE ARE ADVANCES IN OTHER ALTERNATIVE VEHICLE FUELS OR TECHNOLOGIES, OR IF THERE ARE IMPROVEMENTS IN GASOLINE, DIESEL OR HYBRID ENGINES, DEMAND FOR NG VEHICLES MAY DECLINE AND OUR BUSINESS MAY SUFFER.\nTechnological advances in the production, delivery and use of alternative fuels that are, or are perceived to be, cleaner, more cost-effective or more readily available than CNG, LNG or RNG, have the potential to slow adoption of NG vehicles. Advances in gasoline and diesel engine technology, especially hybrids, may offer a cleaner, more cost-effective option and make fleet customers less likely to convert their fleets to NG. Technological advances related to ethanol or biodiesel, which are increasingly used as an additive to, or substitute for, gasoline and diesel fuel, may slow the need to diversify fuels and affect the growth of the NG vehicle market. Use of electric heavy duty trucks or the perception that electric heavy duty trucks may soon be widely available and provide satisfactory performance in heavy duty applications may reduce demand for heavy duty LNG trucks. In addition, hydrogen and other alternative fuels in experimental or developmental stages may eventually offer a cleaner, more cost-effective alternative to gasoline and diesel than NG. Advances in technology that slow the growth of or conversion to NG vehicles, or which otherwise reduce demand for NG as a vehicle fuel, will have an adverse effect on our business. Failure of NG vehicle technology to advance at a sufficient pace may also limit its adoption and our ability to compete with other businesses providing alternative fuels and alternative fuel vehicles.\nOUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN LNG IS CONSTRAINED BY FRAGMENTED AND LIMITED PRODUCTION AND INCREASING COMPETITION FOR LNG SUPPLY. IF WE ARE REQUIRED TO SUPPLY LNG FROM DISTANT LOCATIONS AND CANNOT PASS THESE COSTS THROUGH TO OUR CUSTOMERS, OUR PROJECTED OPERATING MARGINS WILL DECREASE ON THOSE SALES DUE TO OUR INCREASED TRANSPORTATION COSTS.\nProduction of LNG is fragmented and limited. It may be difficult for us to obtain LNG without interruption and near our projected markets at competitive prices or at all. If we are unable to purchase enough of LNG to meet customer demand, we may be liable to our potential customers for penalties and lose customers. Competition for LNG supply is escalating. If we experience a LNG supply interruption or LNG demand exceeds available supply, or if we have difficulty entering or maintaining relationships with contract carriers to deliver LNG on our behalf, our ability to expand future LNG sales to new customers will be limited, our relationships with potential customers may be disrupted and our results of operations may be adversely affected. Furthermore, because transportation of LNG is relatively expensive, if we are required to supply LNG from distant locations and cannot pass these costs through to\nour customers, our projected operating margins will decrease on those sales due to our increased transportation costs.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR SECURITIES\nTHERE MAY BE NOT ENOUGH LIQUIDITY TO SELL OUR SHARES IN THE PUBLIC MARKET.\nWe began trading our stock under the stock symbol NGFF on November 25, 2015 in OTCPINK market and currently we are listed on OTCQB. Since we began trading, to the date of this filing, we had a total volume of 2,750 shares which is not adequate to sell any significant number of shares if you wish to sell a significant number of your shares due to that lack of liquidity in our stock in the market. There is no assurance that a more liquid market for our shares would ever develop and if so you may stand to lose your total investment you make buying our stock.\nTHE PRICE OF THE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT WHICH WE MADE OUR EQUITY LINE OFFERING WAS DETERMINED BY THE LAST PRICE AT WHICH OUR STOCK WAS SOLD IN AN ILLIQUID MARKET, AND THEREFORE SHOULD NOT BE USED AS AN INDICATOR OF THE FUTURE MARKET PRICE OF THE COMMON STOCK. THEREFORE, THE CURRENT PRICE AT WHICH IT TRADES MAY NOT BEAR ANY RELATIONSHIP TO THE ACTUAL VALUE OF THE COMPANY, AND MAY MAKE OUR SHARES DIFFICULT TO SELL.\nAs stated elsewhere in this filing we have an equity line arrangement with Southridge to sell $3,000,000 worth of our stock. The price at which Southridge would buy our shares is established by the market price on the date the purchase price is calculated. Since our shares do not have liquidity the price at which we have established our offering cannot be depended on to be the price at which our stock will sell in the future and as such cannot be considered a good indicator as to the real value of our stock.\nOUR MAJORITY STOCKHOLDER OWNS 4,000,000 SHARES OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK AND 7,000,000 SHARES OF OUR CLASS B COMMON STOCK. BECAUSE OF THE VOTING PREFERENCE GRANTED TO HOLDERS OF SERIES B COMMON STOCK, THE MAJORITY SHAREHOLDER CURRENTLY HOLDS VOTING RIGHTS EQUAL TO HOLDING 74,000,000 SHARES OF CLASS A COMMON STOCK, WHICH REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY 83.75% OF THE CURRENT OUTSTANDING VOTING STOCK OF THE COMPANY. THE MAJORITY SHAREHOLDER\u2019S INTERESTS MAY DIFFER FROM YOURS AND HE WILL BE ABLE TO EXERT SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER OUR CORPORATE DECISIONS, INCLUDING A CHANGE OF CONTROL.\nAs of the reporting date, Mr. I. Andrew Weeraratne, our Chief Executive Officer, held 4,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 7,000,000 shares of Class B common stock, which gives him voting rights equal to 74,000,000 shares of Common Stock because of the 10:1 voting preference granted to the series of Class B common stock. That gives him 83.75% of the voting right in the Company. As a result, he will be able to influence or control matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers, acquisitions or other extraordinary transactions. Mr. Weeraratne may have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and that may be adverse to your interests. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control of our Company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their stock as part of a sale of our Company and may affect the potential market price of our stock. Conversely, this concentration may facilitate a change in control at a time when you and other investors may prefer not to sell.\nOUR ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION PROVIDE SUPER VOTING RIGHTS AND OTHER PRIVILEGES TO OUR CLASS B SHAREHOLDERS INCLUDING A STIPULATION THAT CERTAIN ACTIONS BY THE COMPANY WON\u2019T BE PERMITTED WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF THE HOLDERS OF AT LEAST A MAJORITY OF THE VOTING POWER OF THE THEN OUTSTANDING CLASS B COMMON STOCK, PROVIDING CLASS B COMMON STOCK SHAREHOLDERS WITH SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATIONS, WHICH MAY BE DETRIMENTAL TO THE OTHER SHAREHOLDERS AND POTENTIAL INVESTORS.\nThe Company\u2019s Articles of Incorporation provide that so long as any shares of Class B common stock are outstanding, the Company may not take any of the following actions without the prior written consent of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of Class B common stock:\n\u00b7\nsell, convey or otherwise dispose of or encumber all or substantially all of our assets, or merger with or consolidate with another corporation, other than our wholly-owned subsidiary, or effect any transaction or series of transactions in which more than 50% of the voting power of our Company is transferred or disposed of;\n\u00b7\nalter or change any of the rights of the Class B common stock or increase or decrease the number of shares authorized;\n\u00b7\nauthorize or obligate our company to authorize any other equity security or security which is convertible or exercisable into an equity security of our Company which has rights, preferences or privileges which are superior to, on a parity with or similar to the Class B common stock;\n\u00b7\nredeem or repurchase any of our securities;\n\u00b7\namend our articles of incorporation; or\n\u00b7\nchange the authorized number of our board of directors.\nThis stipulation may discourage certain major investors from investing in our Company and thus may have a negative effect on our results of operations.\nIF WE FAIL TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN AN EFFECTIVE SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROL, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REPORT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS ACCURATELY OR TO PREVENT FRAUD. ANY INABILITY TO REPORT AND FILE OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS ACCURATELY AND TIMELY COULD HARM OUR REPUTATION AND ADVERSELY IMPACT THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.\nEffective internal control is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, we may not be able to manage our business as effectively as we would if an effective control environment existed, and our business and reputation with investors may be harmed. As a result, our small size and any current internal control deficiencies may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operation and access to capital. We have not performed an in-depth analysis to determine if in the past un-discovered failures of internal controls exist, and may in the future discover areas of our internal control that need improvement.\nA DTC \u201cCHILL\u201d ON THE ELECTRONIC CLEARING OF TRADES IN OUR SECURITIES IN THE FUTURE MAY AFFECT THE LIQUIDITY OF OUR STOCK AND OUR ABILITY TO RAISE CAPITAL.\nBecause our common stock is considered a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d there is a risk that the Depository Trust Company (\u201cDTC\u201d) may place a \u201cchill\u201d on the electronic clearing of trades in our securities. This may lead some brokerage firms to be unwilling to accept certificates and/or electronic deposits of our stock and other securities and also some may not accept trades in our securities altogether. A future DTC chill would affect the liquidity of our securities and make it difficult to purchase or sell our securities in the open market. It may also have an adverse effect on our ability to raise capital because investors may be unable to easily resell our securities into the market. Our inability to raise capital on terms acceptable to us, if at all, could have a material and adverse effect on our business and operations.\nOUR COMMON STOCK IS A \u201cPENNY STOCK.\u201d TRADING OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY BE RESTRICTED BY THE SEC\u2019S PENNY STOCK REGULATIONS, WHICH MAY LIMIT A STOCKHOLDER\u2019S ABILITY TO BUY AND SELL OUR COMMON STOCK.\nOur stock is a penny stock. The \u201cSEC\u201d has adopted Rule 15g-9, which generally defines \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined in Rule 15g-9) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and \u201caccredited investors.\u201d The term \u201caccredited investor\u201d refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000(excluding the value of a primary residence) or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC, which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer\u2019s account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer\u2019s confirmation.\nIn addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules; the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our Common Stock.\nWE DO NOT EXPECT TO PAY DIVIDENDS FOR SOME TIME, WHICH COULD RESULT IN NO RETURN ON YOUR INVESTMENT.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain our earnings, if any, to provide funds for the operation and expansion of our business and, therefore, do not anticipate declaring or paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of the Company\u2019s board of directors and will depend upon, among other things, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, contractual restrictions with respect to the payment of dividends and other relevant factors of our operations.", "PERMNO": 18396, "SIC": 1220, "TIC": "AREC"}
