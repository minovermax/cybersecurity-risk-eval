{"cik": "878726", "company": "TUESDAY MORNING CORP/DE", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-09-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to significant risks, including the risks and uncertainties described below. These risks and uncertainties and the other information in this Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements, should be carefully considered. If any of the events described below actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected in a material way.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOutbreaks of communicable disease, or other public health emergencies, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, could substantially harm our business.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and could continue to have, an adverse effect on our business operations, store traffic, employee availability, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flow.\nAs of March 25, 2020, we had temporarily closed all of our stores nationwide, severely reducing revenues and resulting in significant operating losses and the elimination of substantially all operating cash flow. Stores gradually reopened as allowed by state and local jurisdictions, and all but two of our stores had reopened as of the end of June 2020. In the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we completed the permanent closure of 197 stores in connection with our Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. The pandemic also has significantly impacted the global supply chain, with restrictions and limitations on business activities causing disruption and delay. These disruptions and delays have strained certain domestic and international supply chains, which have affected and could continue to negatively affect the flow or availability of certain products.\nOur customers may also be negatively affected by the consequences of COVID-19, which could negatively impact demand for our products as customers delay, reduce or eliminate discretionary purchases at our stores. Any significant reduction in customer visits to, and spending at, our stores caused directly or indirectly by COVID-19 would result in a further loss of revenue and cash flows and negatively impact profitability and could result in other material adverse effects.\nThe extent to which the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity is uncertain considering the rapidly evolving environment and will depend on future developments, including the potential further geographic spread and duration of the ongoing pandemic, the timing and extent of recovery in traffic and consumer spending in our stores, the extent and duration of ongoing impacts to domestic and international supply chains and the related impacts on the flow, availability and cost of products, the production and administration of effective medical treatments and vaccines, and the actions that may be taken by various governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic.\nIncreases in fuel prices and changes in transportation industry regulations or conditions may increase our freight costs and thus our cost of sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nOur freight costs are impacted by changes in fuel prices through surcharges. Fuel prices and surcharges affect freight costs both on inbound shipments from vendors and outbound shipments to our stores. In addition, the U.S. government requires drivers of over-the-road trucks to take certain rest periods which reduces the available amount of time they can drive during a 24-hour period. Changes in trucking industry conditions, such as truck driver shortages and highway congestion, could increase freight costs. High fuel prices or surcharges, as well as stringent driver regulations and changes in transportation industry conditions, may increase freight costs and thereby increase our cost of sales.\nAn increase in the cost or a disruption in the flow of our imported products may significantly decrease our sales and profits.\nMerchandise manufactured and imported from overseas represents the majority of our total product purchases acquired both domestically and internationally. A disruption in the shipping of imported merchandise or an increase in the cost of those products may significantly decrease our sales and profits. In addition, if imported merchandise becomes more expensive or unavailable, the transition to alternative sources may not occur in time to meet our demands. Products from alternative sources may also be of lesser quality and more expensive than those we currently import.\nRisks associated with our reliance on imported products include disruptions in the shipping and importation or increases in the costs of imported products because of factors such as:\n\u2022\nindustry wide supply chain dislocation\n\u2022\nraw material shortages;\n\u2022\nwork stoppages;\n\u2022\nstrikes and political unrest;\n\u2022\nproblems with oceanic shipping, including shipping container shortages;\n\u2022\nincreased customs inspections of import shipments or other factors causing delays in shipments;\n\u2022\nmerchandise quality or safety issues;\n\u2022\neconomic crises;\n\u2022\ninternational disputes, wars, and terrorism;\n\u2022\nloss of \u201cmost favored nation\u201d trading status by the United States in relation to a particular foreign country;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters;\n\u2022\nimport duties and tariffs;\n\u2022\nforeign government regulations;\n\u2022\nimport quotas and other trade sanctions; and\n\u2022\nincreases in shipping rates.\nThe products we buy abroad are sometimes priced in foreign currencies and, therefore, we are affected by fluctuating exchange rates. We might not be able to successfully protect ourselves in the future against currency rate fluctuations, and our financial performance could suffer as a result.\nOur results of operations will be negatively affected if we are unsuccessful in effectively managing our supply chain operations.\nWith few exceptions, all inventory is shipped directly from suppliers to our distribution network, primarily through our Dallas distribution center, where the inventory is then processed, sorted and shipped to our stores. We also use bypass and pool point facilities to distribute inventory to our stores. We depend in large part on the orderly operation of this receiving and distribution process, which depends, in turn, on adherence to shipping schedules and effective management of our distribution centers. External factors, such significant supply chain dislocation caused by COVID-19 pandemic and excessive market demand, can negatively impact our supply chain operations resulting in increased costs and delay. We may not anticipate all of the changing demands which our operations will impose on our receiving and distribution system.\nThe loss of, disruption in operations of, or increased costs in the operation of our distribution center facilities would have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nEvents beyond our control, such as disruptions in operations due to fire or other catastrophic events, labor disagreements or shipping problems, may result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our stores. In the event our distribution center is shut down for any reason, we cannot assure that our insurance will be sufficient, or that insurance proceeds will be paid to us in a timely manner. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and impact to our business, we decided to close our Phoenix distribution center in fourth quarter fiscal 2020 with the closure completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. The level of costs of our distributions center operations, and our related profitability, will be negatively impacted by increased wages as a result of competition to attract qualified employees. In addition, any inefficiencies in the operation of our distribution center facilities as well as delays in the delivery of merchandise to our stores will also negatively impact our profitability.\nChanges in economic and political conditions may adversely affect consumer spending, which could significantly harm our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nThe success of our business depends, to a significant extent, upon the level of consumer spending. A number of factors beyond our control affect the level of consumer spending on merchandise that we offer, including, among other things:\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nunemployment;\n\u2022\nthe housing market;\n\u2022\ndeterioration in consumer confidence;\n\u2022\ncrude oil prices that affect gasoline and diesel fuel, as well as, increases in other fuels used to support utilities;\n\u2022\nefforts by our customers to reduce personal debt levels;\n\u2022\navailability of consumer credit;\n\u2022\ninterest rates;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the financial markets;\n\u2022\ntax rates, tariffs and policies;\n\u2022\nwar, terrorism and other hostilities; and\n\u2022\nconsumer confidence in future economic conditions.\nThe merchandise we sell generally consists of discretionary items. Reduced consumer confidence and spending cut backs may result in reduced demand for our merchandise, including discretionary items, and may force us to take significant inventory markdowns. Reduced demand also may require increased selling and promotional expenses. Adverse economic conditions and any related decrease in consumer demand for our merchandise could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nFailure to identify and respond to changes in consumer trends and preferences could significantly harm our business.\nThe retail home furnishings and housewares industry is subject to sudden shifts in consumer trends and consumer spending. Our sales and results of operations depend in part on our ability to predict or respond to changes in trends and consumer preferences in a timely manner. Although our business model allows us greater flexibility than many traditional retailers to meet consumer preferences and trends, we may not successfully do so. Any sustained failure to anticipate, identify and respond to emerging trends in consumer preferences could negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nOur sales depend on a volume of traffic to our stores, and a reduction in traffic to, or the closing of, anchor tenants and other destination retailers in the shopping centers in which our stores are located could significantly reduce our sales and leave us with excess inventory.\nMost of our stores are located in shopping centers that benefit from varied and complementary tenants, whether specialty or mass retailers, and other destination retailers and attractions to generate sufficient levels of consumer traffic near our stores. Any decline in the volume of consumer traffic at shopping centers, whether because of consumer preferences to shop on the internet or at large warehouse stores, an economic slowdown, a decline in the popularity of shopping centers, the closing of anchor stores or other destination retailers or otherwise, could result in reduced sales at our stores and leave us with excess inventory, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results or business.\nWe must continuously attract buying opportunities for off-price merchandise and anticipate consumer demand as off-price merchandise becomes available, and our failure to do so could adversely affect our performance.\nBy their nature, specific off-price merchandise items are available from manufacturers or vendors generally on a non-recurring basis. As a result, we do not have long-term contracts with our vendors for supply, pricing or access to products, but make individual purchase decisions, which may be for large quantities. Due to economic uncertainties, some of our manufacturers and suppliers may cease operations or may otherwise become unable to continue supplying off-price merchandise on terms acceptable to us. We cannot assure that manufacturers or vendors will continue to make off-price merchandise available to us in quantities acceptable to us, which is especially true at present with the inherent supply chain issues caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, or that our buyers will continue to identify and take advantage of appropriate buying opportunities. In addition, if we misjudge consumer demand for products, we may\nsignificantly overstock unpopular products and be forced to take significant markdowns and miss opportunities to sell more popular products. An inability to acquire suitable off-price merchandise in the future or to accurately anticipate consumer demand for such merchandise would have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur results of operations will be negatively affected if we are not successful in managing our inventory profitably.\nInventory is one of the largest assets on our balance sheet and represented approximately 35% of our total assets at June 30, 2021 and 23% at June 30, 2020. Our inventory balance at June 30, 2021 is higher than during fiscal 2020 due to the COVID-19 disruption to our sales and store closures during the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Efficient inventory management is a key component of our business success and profitability. To be successful, we must maintain sufficient inventory levels to meet our customers\u2019 demands without allowing those levels to increase to such an extent that the costs to store and hold the goods unduly impact our financial results. If our buying decisions do not accurately predict customer trends or purchasing actions, we may have to take unanticipated markdowns to dispose of the excess inventory, which also can adversely impact our financial results. We continue to focus on ways to reduce these risks, but we cannot assure that we will be successful in our inventory management. If we are not successful in managing our inventory balances, our results of operations may be negatively affected. We have recorded significant inventory write-downs from time to time in the past and there can be no assurances that we will not record additional inventory charges in the future.\nThe unplanned loss or departure of one or more members of our senior management or other key management could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur future performance will depend in large part upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management and other key employees. The loss of service of these persons could have a material adverse effect on our business and future prospects. We do not maintain key person life insurance for our senior management. We cannot provide any assurance that we will not experience future turnover related to our senior management team.\nOur business is intensely competitive, and a number of different competitive factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nThe retail home furnishings and housewares industry is intensely competitive. As an off-price retailer of home furnishings and housewares, we currently compete against a diverse group of retailers, including department stores and discount stores, specialty, on-line, and catalog retailers and mass merchants, which sell, among other products, home furnishing, houseware and related products similar and often identical to those we sell. We also compete in particular markets with a substantial number of retailers that specialize in one or more types of home furnishing and houseware products that we sell. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial resources that may, among other things, increase their ability to purchase inventory at lower costs or to initiate and sustain aggressive price competition.\nA number of different competitive factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, including:\n\u2022\nincreased operational efficiencies of competitors;\n\u2022\ncompetitive pricing strategies, including deep discount pricing by a broad range of retailers during periods of poor consumer confidence or economic uncertainty;\n\u2022\ncontinued and prolonged promotional activity by competitors;\n\u2022\nliquidation sales by a number of our competitors who have filed or may file in the future for bankruptcy;\n\u2022\nexpansion by existing competitors;\n\u2022\nentry of new competitors into markets in which we currently operate; and\n\u2022\nadoption by existing competitors of innovative store formats or retail sales methods.\nWe cannot assure that we will be able to continue to compete successfully with our existing or new competitors, or that prolonged periods of deep discount pricing by our competitors will not materially harm our business. We compete for customers, employees, locations, merchandise, services and other important aspects of our business with many other local, regional, national and international retailers. We also face competition from alternative retail distribution channels such as catalogs and, increasingly, e-commerce websites and mobile device applications. Changes in the merchandising, pricing and promotional activities of those competitors, and in the retail industry, in general, may adversely affect our performance.\nIf we are unable to maintain and protect our information technology systems and technologies, we could suffer disruptions in our business, damage to our reputation, increased costs and liability, and obstacles to our growth.\nThe operation of our business is heavily dependent upon the implementation, integrity, security, and successful functioning of our computer networks and information systems, including the point-of-sale systems in our stores, data centers that process transactions, and various software applications used in our operations. Our systems are subject to damage or interruption from weather events, power outages, telecommunications or computer failures, computer viruses, security breaches, employee errors and similar occurrences. A failure of our systems to operate effectively as a result of damage to, interruption, or failure of any of these systems could result in data loss, a failure to meet our reporting obligations, or material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements, or cause losses due to disruption of our business operations and loss of customer confidence. These adverse situations could also lead to loss of sales or profits or cause us to incur additional repair, replacement and development costs. Our inability to improve our information technology systems and technologies may continue to result in inefficiencies, fail to support growth and limit opportunities.\nChanges to federal tax policy may adversely impact our operations and financial performance.\nChanges in U.S. tax or trade policy regarding merchandise produced in other countries could adversely affect our business. Changes in U.S. tariffs, quotas, trade relationships or tax provisions that reduce the supply or increase the relative cost of goods produced in other countries could increase our cost of goods and/or increase our effective tax rate. Although such changes would have implications across the entire industry, we may fail to effectively adapt and to manage the adjustments in strategy that would be necessary in response to those changes. In addition to the general uncertainty and overall risk from potential changes in U.S. laws and policies, as we make business decisions in the face of uncertainty as to potential changes, we may incorrectly anticipate the outcomes, miss out on business opportunities, or fail to effectively adapt our business strategies and manage the adjustments that are necessary in response to those changes. These risks could adversely affect our revenues, increase our effective tax rates, and reduce our profitability.\nOur success depends partly upon our marketing, advertising and promotional efforts. If our marketing spend is inadequate, if we fail to implement programs successfully, or if our competitors are more effective than we are, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nHistorically, we have used marketing and promotional programs to attract customers to our stores and to encourage purchases by our customers. We use various media for our marketing efforts, including email, direct mail, digital video, digital display, search and social networks. If we fail to choose the appropriate medium for our efforts, or fail to implement and execute new marketing opportunities, our competitors may be able to attract some of our customers and cause them to decrease purchases from us and increase purchases elsewhere, which would negatively impact our net sales. Changes in the amount and degree of promotional intensity or merchandising strategy by our competitors could cause us to have some difficulties in retaining existing customers and attracting new customers.\nIf we do not attract, train and retain quality employees in appropriate numbers, including key employees and management, our performance could be adversely affected.\nOur performance is dependent on recruiting, developing, training and retaining quality sales, distribution center and other employees in large numbers, as well as, experienced buying and management personnel. Many of our store employees are in entry level or part-time positions with historically high rates of turnover. Our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling costs is subject to external factors, such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation, and changes in rules governing eligibility for overtime and changing demographics. In the event of increasing wage rates, if we do not increase our wages competitively, our staffing levels and customer service could suffer because of a declining quality of our workforce, or our earnings would decrease if we increase our wage rates, whether in response to market demands or new minimum wage legislation. In addition, our recent emergence from bankruptcy may negatively impact our ability to attract and retain employees. Changes that adversely impact our ability to attract and retain quality employees and management personnel could adversely affect our performance.\nOur results of operations are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or the market price of our common stock.\nOur business is subject to seasonality with a higher level of net sales and operating income generated during the quarter ended December 31, which includes the holiday shopping season. Net sales in the quarters ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 accounted for approximately 29%, 37% and 34% of our annual net sales for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For more information about our seasonality, please read Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Quarterly Results and Seasonality.\u201d\nBecause a significant percentage of our net sales and operating income are generated in the quarter ending December 31, we have limited ability to compensate for shortfalls in December quarter sales or earnings by changes in our operations or strategies in other quarters. A significant shortfall in results for the quarter ending December 31 of any year could have a material adverse effect on our annual results\nof operations and on the market price of our common stock. In addition, in anticipation of higher sales during this period, we purchase substantial amounts of seasonal inventory and hire many temporary employees. An excess of seasonal merchandise inventory could result if our net sales during this principal selling season were to fall below either seasonal norms or expectations. If our December quarter sales results are substantially below expectations, our financial performance and operating results could be adversely affected by unanticipated markdowns, particularly in seasonal merchandise. Lower than anticipated sales in the principal selling season would also negatively affect our ability to absorb the increased seasonal labor costs.\nOur quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly based on additional factors, such as:\n\u2022\nthe amount of net sales contributed by new and existing stores;\n\u2022\nthe timing of certain holidays and advertised events;\n\u2022\nchanges in our merchandise mix and inventory levels;\n\u2022\nthe timing of new store openings;\n\u2022\nthe success of our store relocation program;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, industry and weather conditions that affect consumer spending; and\n\u2022\nactions of competitors, including promotional activity.\nThese factors could also have a material adverse effect on our annual results of operations and on the market price of our common stock.\nIf we fail to protect the security of information about our business and our customers, suppliers, business partners and employees, we could damage our reputation and our business, incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation and government investigations and enforcement actions.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, on our computer networks and information systems. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure and that of our service providers may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Any such attack or breach could compromise our security and remain undetected for a period of time, and confidential information could be misappropriated, resulting in a loss of customers\u2019, suppliers\u2019, business partners\u2019 or employees\u2019 personal information, negative publicity, harm to our business and reputation, and potentially causing us to incur costs to reimburse third parties for damages and potentially subjecting us to government investigations and enforcement actions. In addition, the regulatory environment surrounding data and information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, as new and revised requirements are frequently imposed across our business. Compliance with more demanding privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes, and implementing new initiatives could result in system disruptions. We maintain cyber risk insurance, but this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses from any future breaches of our systems.\nWe are subject to various government regulations, changes in the existing laws and regulations and new laws and regulations which may adversely affect our operations and financial performance.\nThe development and operation of our stores are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations in many areas of our business, including, but not limited to, those that impose restrictions, levy a fee or tax, or require a permit or license, or other regulatory approval, and building and zoning requirements. Difficulties or failures in obtaining required permits, licenses or other regulatory approvals could delay or prevent the opening of a new store, and the suspension of, or inability to renew, a license or permit could interrupt operations at an existing store. We are also subject to laws governing our relationship with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, and other state and federal wage and hour regulations, regulations governing leaves of absence, health insurance mandates, working and safety conditions, and immigration status requirements. Additionally, changes in federal labor laws could result in portions of our workforce being subjected to greater organized labor influence. This could result in an increase to our labor costs. A significant portion of our store personnel are paid at rates related to the minimum wage established by federal, state and municipal law. Additionally, we are subject to certain laws and regulations that govern our handling of customers\u2019 personal information. A failure to protect the integrity and security of our customers\u2019 personal information could expose us to private litigation and government investigations and enforcement actions, as well as materially damage our reputation with our customers. While we endeavor to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, governmental and regulatory bodies may change such laws and regulations in the future which may require us to incur substantial cost increases. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we may be subject to various sanctions, penalties or fines and may be required to cease operations until we achieve compliance which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results and operations.\nWe face risks to our corporate reputation from our customers, employees and other third parties.\nDamage to our corporate reputation could adversely affect our sales results and profitability. Our reputation is partially based on perception. Any incident that erodes the trust or confidence of our customers or the general public could adversely affect our reputation and operating performance, particularly if the incident results in significant adverse publicity or governmental inquiry. An incident could include alleged acts, or omissions by, or situations involving our vendors, our landlords, or our employees outside of work, and may pertain to social or political issues or protests largely unrelated to our business. The use of social media platforms, including blogs, social media websites, and other forms of internet-based communications, which allow individuals access to a broad audience, continues to increase. The opportunity for dissemination of information, including inaccurate information, is seemingly limitless and readily available. Information concerning our Company may be posted on such platforms at any time. Information posted may be adverse to our interests or may be inaccurate, which could negatively affect our sales and profitability, diminish customer trust, reduce employee morale and productivity, and lead to difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified employees. The harm may be immediate, without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction.\nWe face litigation risks from customers, employees, and other third parties in the ordinary course of business.\nOur business is subject to the risk of litigation by customers, current and former employees, suppliers, stockholders and others through private actions, class actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions, or other litigation. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. The cost to defend future litigation may be significant. There may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could decrease customer acceptance of merchandise offerings, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable.\nWe face risks with respect to product liability claims and product recalls, which could adversely affect our reputation, our business, and our consolidated results of operations.\nWe purchase merchandise from third parties and directly import a limited amount of product as importer of record and offer this merchandise to customers for sale. Merchandise could be subject to recalls and other actions by regulatory authorities. Changes in laws and regulations could also impact the type of merchandise we offer to customers. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, issues that result in recalls of merchandise. In addition, in the past, individuals have asserted claims, and may in the future assert claims, that they have sustained injuries from third-party merchandise offered by us, and we may be subject to future lawsuits relating to these claims. There is a risk that these claims or liabilities may exceed, or fall outside the scope of, our insurance coverage. Any of the issues mentioned above could result in damage to our reputation, diversion of development and management resources, or reduced sales and increased costs, any of which could harm our business.\nOur stores may be adversely affected by local conditions, natural disasters, and other events.\nCertain regions in which our stores are located may be subject to adverse local conditions, natural disasters, and other events. If severe weather, such as heavy snowfall or extreme temperatures, discourages or restricts customers in a particular region from traveling to our stores, our sales could be adversely affected. If severe weather conditions occur during the second quarter of our fiscal year, the adverse impact to our sales and profitability could be even greater than at other times during the year because we generate a significant portion of our sales and profits during this period. Natural disasters including tornados, hurricanes, floods, and earthquakes may damage our stores, corporate office, and distribution facilities or other operations, which may adversely affect our financial results. Additionally, demographic shifts in the areas where our stores are located could adversely impact our financial results and operations.\nOur results of operations may be negatively affected by inventory shrinkage.\nWe are subject to the risk of inventory loss and theft. Although our inventory shrinkage rates have not fluctuated significantly in recent years, we cannot assure that actual rates of inventory loss and theft in the future will be within our estimates or that the measures we are taking will effectively reduce the problem of inventory shrinkage. Although some level of inventory shrinkage is an unavoidable cost of doing business, if we were to experience higher rates of inventory shrinkage or incur increased security costs to combat inventory theft, our results of operations could be affected adversely.\nOur results of operations may be negatively impacted by exposure to unexpected costs related to our insurance programs.\nOur insurance coverage is subject to deductibles, self-insured retentions, limits of liability and similar provisions that we believe are prudent based on our overall operations. We may incur certain types of losses that we cannot insure or which we believe are not economically reasonable to insure, such as losses due to acts of war and terrorism, employee and certain other crime, and some natural\ndisasters. If we incur these losses and they are material, our business could suffer. Certain material events may result in sizable losses for the insurance industry and adversely impact the availability of adequate insurance coverage or result in excessive premium increases. To offset negative cost trends in the insurance market, we may elect to self-insure, accept higher deductibles or reduce the amount of coverage in response to these market changes. In addition, we self-insure a significant portion of expected losses under our workers\u2019 compensation, general liability, and group health insurance programs. Unanticipated changes in any applicable actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our recorded liabilities for these self-insured losses, including potential increases in medical and indemnity costs, could result in significantly different expenses than expected under these programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Although we continue to maintain property insurance for catastrophic events, we are self-insured for losses up to the amount of our deductibles. If we experience a greater number of self-insured losses than we anticipate, our financial performance could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to customer payment-related risks that could increase operating costs or exposure to fraud or theft, subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business.\nWe accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, credit and debit cards, gift cards, gift certificates, store credits, and digital wallets. Acceptance of these payment options subjects us to rules, regulations, contractual obligations and compliance requirements, including payment network rules and operating guidelines, data security standards and certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers. In October 2015, the payment card industry shifted liability for certain debit and credit card transactions to retailers who are not able to accept EMV chip technology transactions. Any disruption to our ability to accept EMV chip technology transactions may subject us to increased risk of liability for fraudulent transactions and may adversely affect our business and operating results.\nFor certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs. We rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, and other forms of electronic payment. If these companies become unable to provide these services to us, or if their systems are compromised, it could potentially disrupt our business. The payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by criminals, who are becoming increasingly more sophisticated, seeking to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems. If we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements for the payment methods we accept, or if payment-related data is compromised due to a breach or misuse of data, we may be liable for costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees, or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments may be impaired. In addition, our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types, which may result in a shift to other payment types or potential changes to our payment systems that may result in higher costs. As a result, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Trading Restrictions in our Common Stock\nOur common stock is subject to ownership and transfer restrictions intended to preserve our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes.\nWe have incurred significant net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes, the amount and availability of which are subject to certain qualifications, limitations and uncertainties. Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation imposes certain restrictions on the transferability and ownership of our common stock in order to reduce the possibility of an equity ownership shift that could result in limitations on our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes from prior years for federal income tax purposes. Any acquisition or sale of our common stock that results in a stockholder being in violation of these restrictions may not be valid.\nSubject to certain exceptions, these ownership restrictions restrict (i) any transfer that would result in any person acquiring 4.5% or more of our common stock, (ii) any transfer that would result in an increase of the ownership percentage of any person already owning 4.5% or more of our common stock, or (iii) any transfer during the five-year period following December 31, 2020 that would result in a decrease of the ownership percentage of any person already owning 4.5% or more of our common stock. These restrictions will remain in effect until the earliest of (i) the repeal of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code or any successor statute if the board of directors determines these restrictions are no longer necessary for preservation of the Company\u2019s tax benefits, (ii) the beginning of a taxable year in which the board of directors determines no tax benefits may be carried forward, or (iii) such other date as shall be established by the board of directors.", "PERMNO": 86866, "SIC": 5331, "TIC": "TUESQ"}
