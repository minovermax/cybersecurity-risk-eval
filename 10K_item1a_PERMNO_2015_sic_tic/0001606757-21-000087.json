{"cik": "1606757", "company": "Kimball Electronics, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-08-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A - Risk Factors\nThe following important risk factors, among others, could affect future results and events, causing results and events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements made in this report and presented elsewhere by management from time to time. Such factors, among others, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and should be carefully considered. Many of the risk factors could be exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and any worsening of the global business and economic environment as a result. Additional risks and uncertainties that we do not currently know about, we currently believe are immaterial, or we have not predicted may also affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Because of these and other factors, past performance should not be considered an indication of future performance.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nReduction of purchases by, or the loss of, one or more key customers could reduce revenues and profitability.\nLosses of key customers within specific industries or significant volume reductions from key customers are both risks. If one of our current customers merges with or is acquired by a party that currently is aligned with a competitor, or the combination creates excess capacity, we could lose future revenues. Our continuing success is dependent upon replacing expiring contract customers/programs with new customers/programs. See \u201cCustomers\u201d in Item 1 - Business for disclosure of the net sales as a percentage of consolidated net sales for each of our significant customers during fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019. Regardless of whether our agreements with our customers, including our significant customers, have a definite term, our customers typically do not have an obligation to purchase a minimum quantity of products or services as individual purchase orders or other product or project specific documentation are typically entered into from time to time. Our customers generally have the right to cancel a particular product, subject to contractual provisions governing the final product runs, excess or obsolete inventory, recovery of dedicated investments, and end-of-life pricing. As such, our ability to continue the relationships with such customers is uncertain.\nSignificant declines in the level of purchases by key customers or the loss of a significant number of customers could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, the nature of the contract manufacturing industry is such that the start-up of new customers and new programs to replace expiring programs occurs frequently, and new customers and program start-ups generally cause margin dilution early in the life of a program. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to fully replace any lost sales, which could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe may be unable to purchase a sufficient amount of materials, parts, and components for use in our products at competitive prices, in a timely manner, or at all.\nWe depend on suppliers globally to provide timely delivery of materials, parts, and components for use in our products. The financial stability of suppliers is monitored by us when feasible as the loss of a significant supplier could have an adverse impact on our operations. Suppliers adjust their capacity as demand fluctuates, and component shortages and/or component allocations could occur in addition to longer lead times. Certain components purchased by us are primarily manufactured in select regions of the world and issues in those regions could cause manufacturing delays. Maintaining strong relationships with key suppliers of components critical to the manufacturing process is essential. Price increases of commodity components, including increased tariffs, could have an adverse impact on our profitability if we cannot offset such increases with other cost reductions or by price increases to customers. Materials utilized in our manufacturing process are generally available, but future availability is unknown and could impact our ability to meet customer order requirements. The EMS industry is currently experiencing component shortages, component allocations, and shipping delays, particularly with semiconductors, driven by the strong demand in consumer electronics and the beginning of a global recovery, and complicated by the continued impact of COVID-19. Component shortages or allocations could increase component costs and potentially interrupt our operations and negatively impact our ability to meet commitments to customers. If suppliers fail to meet commitments to us in terms of price, delivery, or quality, or if the supply chain is unable to react timely to increases in demand, it could interrupt our operations and negatively impact our ability to meet commitments to customers.\nWe are subject to manufacturing inefficiencies or underutilization due to start-up or expansion of facilities, programs, transfers of production, personnel turnover and shortages, and other related factors.\nWe are currently expanding our global operations by increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure at certain facilities to support our business. This expansion increases the complexity of our business and places significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions. We may not be able to manage these expansions effectively, which could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.\nThe start-up of new programs requires the coordination of the design and manufacturing processes. The design and engineering required for certain new programs can take an extended period of time, and further time may be required to achieve customer acceptance. Accordingly, the launch of any particular program may be delayed, less successful than we originally anticipated, or not successful at all. Additionally, most of our customers do not commit to long-term production schedules, and we are unable to forecast the level of customer orders with certainty over a given period of time. As a result, at times it can be difficult for us to schedule production and maximize utilization of our manufacturing capacity. Fluctuations and deferrals of customer orders may have a material adverse effect on our ability to utilize our fixed capacity. All of these types of manufacturing inefficiencies could have an adverse impact on our financial position, operating margins, results of operations, or cash flows.\nThe high demand for manufacturing labor in certain geographic areas in which we operate makes recruiting new production employees and retaining experienced production employees difficult. Shortages of production workers could adversely impact our ability to complete our customers\u2019 orders on a timely basis, which could adversely affect our relations with customers, potentially resulting in reduction in orders from customers or loss of customers. Turnover in personnel could result in additional training and inefficiencies that could adversely impact our operating results.\nOur international operations make us vulnerable to financial and operational risks associated with doing business in foreign countries.\nWe have operations outside the United States, primarily in China, India, Mexico, Poland, Romania, Thailand, and Vietnam. Our international operations are subject to a number of risks, which may include the following:\n\u2022economic and political instability, including the uncertainties caused by the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union;\n\u2022foreign governments\u2019 measures taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022warfare, riots, terrorism, and other forms of violence or geopolitical disruption;\n\u2022compliance with laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, applicable to U.S. companies doing business outside the United States;\n\u2022changes in U.S. or foreign policies, regulatory requirements, and laws;\n\u2022tariffs and other trade barriers, including tariffs imposed by the United States as well as responsive tariffs imposed by China, the European Union, or Mexico;\n\u2022potentially adverse tax consequences, including changes in tax rates and the manner in which multinational companies are taxed in the United States and other countries; and\n\u2022foreign labor practices.\nThese risks could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In addition, fluctuations in exchange rates could impact our operating results. Our risk management strategy includes the use of derivative financial instruments to hedge certain foreign currency exposures. Any hedging techniques we implement contain risks and may not be entirely effective. Exchange rate fluctuations could also make our products more expensive than competitors\u2019 products not subject to these fluctuations, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability in international markets.\nCertain foreign jurisdictions restrict the amount of cash that can be transferred to the United States or impose taxes and penalties on such transfers of cash. To the extent we have excess cash in foreign locations that could be used in, or is needed by, our operations in the United States, we may incur significant penalties and/or taxes to repatriate these funds.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and may not be able to compete successfully.\nNumerous manufacturers within the contract manufacturing industry compete globally for business from existing and potential customers. Some of our competitors have greater resources and more geographically diversified international operations than we do. We also face competition from the manufacturing operations of our customers, who are continually evaluating the merits of manufacturing products internally against the advantages of outsourcing to contract manufacturing service providers. In the past, some of our customers have decided to in-source a portion of their manufacturing from us in order to utilize their excess internal manufacturing capacity. The competition may further intensify as more companies enter the markets in which we operate, as existing competitors expand capacity, and as the industry consolidates.\nIn relation to customer pricing pressures, if we cannot achieve the proportionate reductions in costs, profit margins may suffer. The high level of competition in the industry impacts our ability to implement price increases or, in some cases, even maintain prices, which also could lower profit margins. In addition, as end markets dictate, we are continually assessing excess capacity and developing plans to better utilize manufacturing operations, including consolidating and shifting manufacturing capacity to lower cost venues as necessary.\nIf our engineering and manufacturing services do not meet our customers\u2019 quality standards, our sales, operating results, and reputation could suffer.\nWe make substantial investments of capital and operating expenses to implement comprehensive, company-wide quality systems, certifications, and controls in our operations in an effort to ensure sustained compliance with various product and quality system regulations and requirements, and to meet the needs of our customers. However, in the event we fail to adhere to these requirements, we become subject to costs associated with product defects, interruptions in production, and reputational harm. Our failure to comply with applicable quality system standards could, in turn, adversely affect our customers through failures to supply product to them. Quality or noncompliance failures could have an adverse effect on our reputation in addition to an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. While we maintain product liability and other insurance coverage that we believe to be generally in accordance with industry practices, our insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us fully against substantial claims and costs that may arise from liabilities related to product defects.\nOur business may be harmed due to failure to successfully implement information technology solutions or a lack of reasonable safeguards to maintain data security, including adherence to data privacy laws and physical security measures.\nThe operation of our business depends on effective information technology systems, which are subject to the risk of security breach or cybersecurity threat, including misappropriation of assets or other sensitive information, such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees, customers, and other business partners, or data corruption which could cause operational disruption. As we could be the target of cyber and other security threats, which are becoming increasingly sophisticated, we must continuously monitor and develop our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent, detect, address, and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, and other events that could have a security impact. Information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to research new technologies and processes, maintain and enhance existing systems, and develop new systems in order to keep pace with changes in information processing technology and evolving industry standards as well as to protect against cyber risks and security breaches. While we provide employee awareness training around phishing, malware, and other cyber threats to help protect against these cyber and security risks, we cannot ensure the measures we take to protect our information technology systems will be sufficient.\nImplementation delays, poor execution, or a breach of information technology systems could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, or increase costs related to the mitigation of, response to, or litigation arising from any such issue. Similar risks exist with our third-party vendors. Any problems caused by these third parties, including those resulting from disruption in communications services, cyber attacks, or security breaches, have the potential to hinder our ability to conduct business. In addition, data privacy laws and regulations, such as the European Union General Data Protection Regulation and similar legislation in jurisdictions in which we operate, pose increasingly complex compliance challenges and potentially elevate costs, and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in significant penalties.\nThe cost of providing employee healthcare benefits could increase and reduce our profitability.\nWe are self-insured up to certain limits for certain domestic employee health benefits. For these self-insured health plans, we incur the cost of claims, which may include catastrophic claims, with the employees bearing a limited portion of the cost through insurance premiums and deductibles. Accordingly, increases in employee healthcare benefit costs, including as a result of the high costs associated with treatments and prescriptions for rare diseases could have an adverse effect on our profitability.\nRegulatory and Litigation Risks\nLitigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and have a negative impact on our reputation.\nWe are or may become party to various claims and legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our business. These claims and legal proceedings may include lawsuits or claims relating to contracts, intellectual property, product recalls, product liability, employment matters, environmental matters, regulatory compliance, or other aspects of our business. Even when not merited, the defense of these claims and legal proceedings may divert our management\u2019s attention, and we may incur significant expenses in defending these claims and proceedings. In addition, we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. The outcome of litigation is often difficult to predict, and the outcome of pending or future claims and legal proceedings may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. We evaluate these claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. Based on these assessments and estimates, we establish reserves or disclose the relevant litigation claims or legal proceedings, as appropriate. These assessments and estimates are based on the information available to management at the time and involve a significant amount of management judgment. Actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from our current assessments and estimates. If actual outcomes or losses differ materially from our current assessments and estimates or additional claims or legal proceedings are initiated, we could be exposed to significant liabilities.\nFailure to protect our intellectual property could undermine our competitive position.\nCompeting effectively depends, to a significant extent, on maintaining the proprietary nature of our intellectual property. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights worldwide through a combination of keeping our proprietary information secret and utilizing trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws, as well as licensing agreements and third-party non-disclosure and assignment agreements. Because of the differences in foreign laws concerning proprietary rights, our intellectual property rights do not generally receive the same degree of protection in foreign countries as they do in the United States, and therefore, in some parts of the world, we have limited protections, if any, for our intellectual property. If we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property embodied in our solutions, designs, processes, and products, the competitive advantages of our proprietary technology could be reduced or eliminated, which would harm our business and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Indiana law could delay or prevent a change in control.\nWe have adopted Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws. Certain provisions of the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and the Amended and Restated Bylaws may delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a Share Owner may consider favorable. For example, the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock, prevents Share Owners from acting by written consent without unanimous consent, and requires a supermajority Share Owner approval for certain business combinations with related persons. These provisions may discourage acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control, which could harm our stock price. Indiana law also imposes some restrictions on potential acquirers.\nOur failure to maintain applicable registrations for our manufacturing facilities could negatively impact our ability to produce products for our customers.\nWe make substantial investments of capital and operating expenses to implement comprehensive, company-wide quality systems, certifications, and controls in our operations in an effort to ensure sustained compliance with various product and quality system regulations and requirements, and to meet the needs of our customers. However, in the event we fail to adhere to these requirements, we become subject to potential investigations and fines and penalties. Our failure to comply with applicable regulations and quality system standards could, in turn, adversely affect our customers through failures to supply product to them or delays in their ability to obtain and maintain product approvals. As a medical device manufacturer, we also have additional compliance requirements. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) extensively regulates all aspects of product and manufacturing quality for medical products under its current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) regulations. Outside the U.S., our operations and our customers\u2019 products are subject to similar regulatory requirements, notably by the European Medicines Agency and the Safe Food and Drug Administration in China. For instance, we are required to register with the FDA and are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation (\u201cQSR\u201d) requirements, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including testing, quality control and documentation procedures. Any determination by the FDA or other regulatory authorities of manufacturing or other deficiencies could adversely affect our business. Failure or noncompliance could have an adverse effect on our reputation in addition to an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe are subject to extensive environmental regulation and significant potential environmental liabilities.\nThe past and present operation and ownership by Kimball Electronics of manufacturing plants and real property are subject to extensive and changing federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to discharges in air, water, and land, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, the use of certain hazardous materials in the production of select products, and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances. In addition, the increased prevalence of global climate change concerns may result in new regulations that may negatively impact us. We cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future, how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted, or what environmental conditions may be found to exist. Compliance with more stringent laws or regulations, or stricter interpretation of existing laws, may require additional expenditures, some of which could be material. In addition, any investigations or remedial efforts relating to environmental matters could involve material costs or otherwise result in material liabilities.\nThe long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and our industry in particular are unclear. Changes in climate where we, our customers, and our supply chain operate could have a long-term adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, we have committed to cut our greenhouse gas emissions, water usage, electrical usage, and air emissions significantly by 2025 as part of our long-term sustainability strategy, and we may take additional voluntary steps to mitigate our impact on the environment. Environmental regulations or changes in the supply, demand, or available sources of energy or other resources may affect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural resources, necessary to run our business. The cost of energy is a critical component of freight expense and the cost of\noperating manufacturing facilities. Increases in the cost of energy could reduce our profitability. Given the political significance and uncertainty around these issues, we cannot predict how legislation, regulation, and increased awareness of these issues will affect our operations and financial condition.\nCompliance with government legislation and regulations may significantly increase our operating costs in the United States and abroad.\nLegislation and regulations promulgated by the U.S. federal and foreign governments could significantly impact our profitability by burdening us with forced cost choices that either cannot be recovered by increased pricing or, if we increase our pricing, could negatively impact demand for our products. For example:\n\u2022Changes in policies by the U.S. or other governments could negatively affect our operating results due to changes in duties, tariffs or taxes, or limitations on currency or fund transfers, as well as government-imposed restrictions on producing certain products in, or shipping them to, specific countries. For example, our facility in Mexico operates under the Mexican Maquiladora (\u201cIMMEX\u201d) program. This program provides for reduced tariffs and eased import regulations. We could be adversely affected by changes in the IMMEX program or our failure to comply with its requirements. As another example, the U.S. government has imposed tariffs on certain products imported from China. China has imposed tariffs on certain U.S. products in retaliation. These tariffs could force our customers or us to consider various strategic options including, but not limited to, looking for different suppliers, shifting production to facilities in different geographic regions, absorbing the additional costs, or passing the cost on to customers. Ultimately, these tariffs could adversely affect the competitiveness of our domestic operations, which could lead to the reduction or exit of certain U.S. manufacturing capacity. Depending on the types of changes made, demand for our foreign manufacturing facilities could be reduced, or operating costs in our manufacturing facilities could be increased, which could negatively impact our financial performance. Moreover, any retaliatory actions by other countries where we operate could also negatively impact our financial performance.\n\u2022The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals, known as \u201cconflict minerals,\u201d originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo (\u201cDRC\u201d) and adjoining countries. These rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply, and pricing of materials used in our products, as the number of suppliers who provide conflict-free minerals may be limited. We may also suffer reputational harm if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict-free or if we are unable to modify our products to avoid the use of such materials. We may also face challenges in satisfying customers who may require that our products be certified as containing conflict-free minerals or that we adopt more stringent guidelines like those fostered by the Responsible Materials Initiative (\u201cRMI\u201d).\n\u2022We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety, product stewardship and producer responsibility laws and regulations, including those arising from global pandemics or relating to the use, generation, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our manufacturing process, those governing worker health and safety, those requiring design changes, supply chain investigation or conformity assessments, and those relating to the recycling or reuse of products we manufacture. These include EU regulations and directives, such as the Restrictions on Hazardous Substances (RoHS), the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (\u201cWEEE\u201d) directives, and the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals (\u201cREACH\u201d) regulation, and similar regulations in China (the Management Methods for Controlling Pollution for Electronic Information Products or \u201cChina RoHS\u201d). In addition, new technical classifications of e-Waste being discussed in the Basel Convention technical working group could affect both our customers\u2019 abilities and obligations in electronics repair and refurbishment. If we fail to comply with any present or future regulations or timely obtain any needed permits, we could become subject to liabilities, and we could face fines or penalties, the suspension of production, or prohibitions on sales of products we manufacture. In addition, such regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment, or to incur other significant expenses, including expenses associated with the recall of any non-compliant product or with changes in our operational, procurement and inventory management activities.\nIn addition, there is an increasing governmental focus around the world on global warming and environmental impact issues, which may result in new environmental, health and safety regulations that may affect us, our suppliers and our customers. This could cause us to incur additional direct costs for compliance, as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers, suppliers or both incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. These costs may adversely impact our operations and financial condition.\nSocial and environmental responsibility policies and guidelines may increase our costs and impose difficult and expensive compliance requirements.\nAlong with our stakeholders and our broader industry, we have increased our focus on sustainability and measurement of our progress against Environmental, Social, and Governance (\u201cESG\u201d) criteria. Our customers have adopted, and may continue to adopt, procurement policies that require us to comply with social, and environmental responsibility provisions. In addition, an increasing number of investors have adopted, and may continue to adopt, ESG policies for their portfolio companies, and various voluntarily sustainability initiatives and organizations have promulgated different social and environmental responsibility and sustainability guidelines. These practices, policies, provisions, and initiatives are under active development, subject to change, can be unpredictable and conflicting, and may prove difficult and expensive for us to comply with. These costs may adversely impact our operations and financial condition.\nFinancial Risks\nWe are exposed to the credit risk of our customers.\nThe instability of market conditions drives an elevated risk of potential bankruptcy of customers resulting in a greater risk of uncollectible outstanding accounts receivable. Accordingly, we intensely monitor our receivables and related credit risks. The realization of these risks could have a negative impact on our profitability.\nFailure to effectively manage working capital may adversely affect our cash flow from operations.\nWe closely monitor inventory and receivable efficiencies and continuously strive to improve these measures of working capital, but customer financial difficulties, cancellation or delay of customer orders, shifts in customer payment practices, transfers of production among our manufacturing facilities, additional inventory purchases to mitigate potential impact from component shortages, or manufacturing delays could adversely affect our cash flow from operations.\nWe could incur losses due to asset impairment.\nAs business conditions change, we must continually evaluate and work toward the optimum asset base. It is possible that certain assets such as, but not limited to, facilities, equipment, intangible assets, or goodwill could be impaired at some point in the future depending on changing business conditions. Such impairment could have an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nFor example, in fiscal year 2020, we recorded a $7.9 million impairment charge associated with the goodwill of our GES reporting unit. See Note 6 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the charge.\nFluctuations in our effective tax rate could have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic mix of earnings across the jurisdictions where we operate. Changes in tax laws or tax rates in those jurisdictions could have a material impact on our operating results. Judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes, other tax liabilities, interest, and penalties. We base our tax position upon the anticipated nature and conduct of our business and upon our understanding of the tax laws of the various countries in which we have assets or conduct activities. Our tax position, however, is subject to review and possible challenge by taxing authorities and to possible changes in law (including adverse changes to the manner in which the United States and other countries tax multinational companies or interpret their tax laws). We cannot determine in advance the extent to which some jurisdictions may assess additional tax or interest and penalties on such additional taxes. In addition, our effective tax rate may be increased by changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in our cash management strategies, changes in local tax rates, or countries adopting more aggressive interpretations of tax laws.\nSeveral countries where we operate provide tax incentives to attract and retain business. We have obtained incentives where available and practicable. Our taxes could increase if: certain incentives were retracted, they were not renewed upon expiration, we no longer qualify for such programs, or tax rates applicable to us in such jurisdictions were otherwise increased. In addition, further acquisitions may cause our effective tax rate to increase. Given the scope of our international operations and our international tax arrangements, changes in tax rates and the manner in which multinational companies are taxed in the United States and other countries could have a material impact on our financial results and competitiveness.\nCertain of our subsidiaries provide financing, products, and services to, and may undertake certain significant transactions with, other subsidiaries in different jurisdictions. Moreover, several jurisdictions in which we operate have tax laws with detailed transfer pricing rules which require that all transactions with non-resident related parties be priced using arm\u2019s length pricing\nprinciples and that contemporaneous documentation must exist to support such pricing. Due to inconsistencies among jurisdictions in the application of the arm\u2019s length standard, our transfer pricing methods may be challenged and, if not upheld, could increase our income tax expense. Risks associated with transfer pricing adjustments are further highlighted by the global initiative from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d) known as the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (\u201cBEPS\u201d) project. The BEPS project is challenging longstanding international tax norms regarding the taxation of profits from cross-border business. Given the scope of our international operations and the fluid and uncertain nature of how the BEPS project might ultimately lead to future legislation, it is difficult to assess how any changes in tax laws would impact our income tax expense.\nA failure to comply with the financial covenants under our credit facilities could adversely impact us.\nOur primary credit facility requires us to comply with certain financial covenants. We believe the most significant covenants under our credit facilities are the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness minus unencumbered U.S. cash on hand in the United States in excess of $15 million to adjusted consolidated EBITDA, as defined in our primary credit facility, and the fixed charge coverage ratio. More detail on these financial covenants is discussed in Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. As of June 30, 2021, we had $66.2 million in borrowings under our credit facilities and had total cash and cash equivalents of $106.4 million. In the future, a default on the financial covenants under our credit facilities could cause an increase in the borrowing rates or make it more difficult for us to secure future financing, which could adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk on our borrowings.\nWe have exposure to interest rate risk on our borrowings under our credit facilities. The interest rates of these borrowings are based on a spread plus applicable base rate, including the London interbank offered rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), the prime rate of a reference bank, or the federal funds rate. An adverse change in the base rates upon which our interest rates are determined could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIn addition, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority has announced that after 2021 it would no longer persuade or compel panel banks to submit the rates required to calculate LIBOR. In March 2021, the administrator of LIBOR, the ICE Benchmark Administration, publicly announced that it will cease publication of LIBOR settings, either on December 31, 2021 or June 30, 2023, subject to the LIBOR settings. As LIBOR is discontinued and we transition to a new rate, interest rates on our current or future indebtedness may be adversely affected.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe will face risks commonly encountered with growth through acquisitions.\nOur sales growth plans may occur through both organic growth and acquisitions. Acquisitions involve many risks, including:\n\u2022difficulties in identifying suitable acquisition candidates and in negotiating and consummating acquisitions on terms attractive to us;\n\u2022difficulties in the assimilation of the personnel, processes, and operations of the acquired company;\n\u2022difficulties in bringing internal control over financial reporting into compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in a timely manner;\n\u2022the diversion of resources, including diverting management\u2019s attention from our current operations;\n\u2022risks of entering new geographic or product markets in which we have limited or no direct prior experience;\n\u2022the potential loss of key customers of the acquired company;\n\u2022the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company;\n\u2022the potential incurrence of indebtedness to fund the acquisition;\n\u2022the potential issuance of common stock for some or all of the purchase price, which could dilute ownership interests of our current Share Owners;\n\u2022the acquired business not achieving anticipated revenues, earnings, cash flow, or market share;\n\u2022excess capacity;\n\u2022the assumption of undisclosed liabilities;\n\u2022potential adverse tax effects; and\n\u2022dilution of earnings.\nWe may implement future restructuring efforts and those efforts may not be successful.\nWe continually evaluate our manufacturing capabilities and capacities in relation to current and anticipated market conditions. We may implement restructuring plans in the future, and the successful execution of those restructuring initiatives will be dependent on various factors and may not be accomplished as quickly or effectively as anticipated.\nChanges in financial accounting standards or policies have affected, and in the future may affect, our reported financial condition or results of operations.\nWe prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. These principles are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d), the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the SEC, and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies. A change in these policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions that are completed before a change is announced. Changes to those rules or questions as to how we interpret or implement them may have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results or on the way we conduct business. See Note 1 - Business Description and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the adoption of the new accounting guidance.\nOur failure to retain the existing management team, maintain our engineering, technical, and manufacturing process expertise, or continue to attract qualified personnel could adversely affect our business.\nWe depend significantly on our executive officers and other key personnel. The unexpected loss of the services of any one of these executive officers or other key personnel may have an adverse effect on us.\nOur success also depends on keeping pace with technological advancements, including Industry 4.0, and adapting services to provide manufacturing capabilities which meet customers\u2019 changing needs. Therefore, we must retain our qualified engineering and technical personnel and successfully anticipate and respond to technological changes in a cost effective and timely manner. Our culture and guiding principles focus on continuous training, motivating, and development of employees, and we strive to attract, motivate, and retain qualified personnel. Failure to retain and attract qualified personnel could adversely affect our business.\nA change in our sales mix among various products could have a negative impact on our gross profit margin.\nChanges in product sales mix could negatively impact our gross margin as margins of different products vary. We strive to improve the margins of all products, but certain products have lower margins in order to price the product competitively or in connection with the start-up of a new program. An increase in the proportion of sales of products with lower margins could have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nNatural disasters or other catastrophic events such as the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our production schedules and, in turn, negatively impact profitability.\nNatural disasters or other catastrophic events, including severe weather, terrorist attacks, power interruptions, fires, and pandemics, could disrupt operations and likewise our ability to produce or deliver products. Our manufacturing operations require significant amounts of energy, including natural gas and oil, and governmental regulations may control the allocation of such fuels to Kimball Electronics. Employees are an integral part of our business, and events such as a pandemic could reduce the availability of employees reporting for work. In the event we experience a temporary or permanent interruption in our ability to produce or deliver product, revenues could be reduced, and business could be materially adversely affected. In addition, catastrophic events, or the threat thereof, can adversely affect U.S. and world economies, and could result in reduced demand for our customers\u2019 products and delayed or lost revenue for our services. Further, any continuing disruption in our computer systems could adversely affect the ability to receive and process customer orders, manufacture products, and ship products on a timely basis, and could adversely affect relations with customers, potentially resulting in reduction in orders from customers or loss of customers. We maintain insurance to help protect us from costs relating to some of these matters, but such may not be sufficient or paid in a timely manner to us in the event of such an interruption.\nFor example, the COVID-19 pandemic poses the risk that we or our employees, suppliers, customers, and others may be restricted or prevented from conducting business activities as normal for indefinite or intermittent periods of time, which has impacted and will continue to impact our global operations. Several of our facilities have experienced temporary suspensions of operations due to the COVID-19 outbreak. While all facilities have since resumed normal operations, further temporary suspensions could occur. All of our operations have been, and will continue to be, impacted to varying degrees by government measures worldwide to contain or mitigate the spread of the virus, including travel restrictions, restrictions on operation of businesses, shelter in place orders, and mandatory closures of schools and child-care facilities, which in turn can have adverse\nimpacts on the availability of critical components, our supply chain, capacity utilization at our facilities, and the ability of certain employees to return to work. We have modified our business practices for the continued health and safety of our employees and may take further actions, or be required to take further actions, that are in the best interests of our employees. Our suppliers and customers have also implemented, or may implement, similar practices in response to the pandemic. The implementation of health and safety practices by us or our suppliers or customers could adversely impact deliveries and productivity and increase costs. In addition, responding to the continuing pandemic could divert management\u2019s attention from our key strategic priorities or cause us to divert or delay the application of our resources toward initiatives that may otherwise increase our long-term value. We cannot reasonably predict the full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows, which will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and continuously evolving, including, the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its severity, new medical and other information that may emerge concerning COVID-19, further actions by governmental entities or others in response to the pandemic, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume.", "PERMNO": 14942, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "KE"}
