Risk Factors\nBecause the Bank intends to emphasize commercial real estate and commercial business loan originations, the Company\u2019s credit risk could increase and continued weakness in the local real estate market or economy could adversely affect its earnings.\nThe Bank intends to emphasize originating commercial real estate and commercial business loans. Because the repayment of commercial real estate and commercial business loans depends on the successful management and operation of the borrower\u2019s properties or related businesses, repayment of such loans can be affected by adverse conditions in the local real estate market or economy. Commercial real estate and commercial business loans generally have more risk than one- to four-family residential real estate loans. Commercial real estate and commercial business loans may also involve relatively large loan balances to individual borrowers or groups of related borrowers. Any continued weakness or downturn in the real estate market or the local economy could adversely affect the value of properties securing the loan or the revenues from the borrower\u2019s business, thereby increasing the risk of nonperforming loans. As the Bank\u2019s commercial real estate portfolio increases, the corresponding risks and potential for losses from these loans may also increase.\nIf the Bank\u2019s allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, the Company\u2019s earnings will decrease.\nThe Bank makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of the loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as\ncollateral for the repayment of many of the loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, management reviews the Bank\u2019s loans and the loss and delinquency experience and evaluates economic conditions. If management\u2019s assumptions are incorrect, the Bank\u2019s allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio, resulting in additions to the Bank\u2019s allowance. Material additions to the Bank\u2019s allowance could materially decrease the Company\u2019s net income.\nIn addition, bank regulators periodically review the Bank\u2019s allowance for loan losses and may require the Bank to increase the allowance for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. Any increase in the Bank\u2019s allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities might have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) has adopted Accounting Standard Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2016-13. This standard, often referred to as \u201cCECL\u201d (reflecting a current expected credit loss model), will require companies to recognize an allowance for credit losses based on estimates of losses expected to be realized over the contractual lives of the loans. Under current U.S. GAAP, companies generally recognize credit losses only when it is probable that a loss has been incurred as of the balance sheet date. This new standard will require the Bank to collect and review increased types and amounts of data for management to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses, and may require the Bank to increase the allowance for loan losses. Any increase in the Bank\u2019s allowance for loan losses or expenses may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10 which defers the effective date of ASU 2016-13 for SEC filers that are eligible to be smaller reporting companies, non-SEC filers, and all other companies to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Bank\u2019s management will continue to work through the provisions of the ASU to determine what impact it will have on the consolidated financial statements.\nFuture changes in interest rates could reduce the Company\u2019s profits.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to make a profit largely depends on the Company\u2019s net interest income, which could be negatively affected by changes in interest rates. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income the Company earns on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and the interest expense the Company pays on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings.\nThe majority of the Bank\u2019s portfolio loans have fixed interest rates. Additionally, many of the Company\u2019s investment securities have fixed interest rates. Like many financial institutions, the Bank\u2019s focus on deposit accounts as a source of funds, which have no stated maturity date or short contractual maturities, results in the Company\u2019s liabilities having a shorter duration than its assets. This imbalance can create significant earnings volatility, because market interest rates change over time. In a period of rising interest rates, the interest income earned on assets, such as loans and investments, may not increase as rapidly as the interest paid on liabilities, such as deposits. In a period of declining interest rates, the interest income earned on assets may decrease more rapidly than the interest paid on liabilities, as borrowers prepay mortgage loans, and mortgage-backed securities and callable investment securities are called or prepaid, thereby requiring the Company to reinvest the cash flows at lower interest rates.\nChanges in interest rates creates reinvestment risk, which is the risk that the Company may not be able to reinvest prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates earned on the prepaid loans or investment securities in a declining interest rate environment. Additionally, increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand and/or make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable-rate loans. Changes in interest rates also affect the current fair value of the Company\u2019s interest-earning securities portfolio. Generally, the value of securities moves inversely with changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2019, a \u201crate shock\u201d analysis indicated that the Company\u2019s net portfolio value (the difference between the present value of assets and the present value of liabilities) would decrease by approximately $3.8 million, or 2.42%, if there was an instantaneous 200 basis point increase in market interest rates.\nDownturns in the local real estate market or economy could adversely affect the Company\u2019s earnings.\nA downturn in the real estate market or the local economy could adversely affect the value of properties securing the loan or the revenues from the borrower\u2019s business, thereby increasing the risk of nonperforming\nloans. If the Company is required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values, the earnings and shareholders\u2019 equity could be adversely affected. The declines in real estate prices in the Company\u2019s markets also may result in increases in delinquencies and losses in the loan portfolios. Unexpected decreases in real estate prices coupled with a prolonged economic recovery and elevated levels of unemployment could drive losses beyond that which is provided for in the Company\u2019s allowance for loan losses. In that event, the Company\u2019s earnings could be adversely affected.\nA worsening of economic conditions could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nDuring the financial crisis, there were dramatic declines in the housing market, where falling real estate values and increasing foreclosures, unemployment, and under-employment negatively impacted the credit performance of mortgage loans and resulted in significant write-downs of asset values by financial institutions. The Bank\u2019s lending business is tied, in large part, to the housing market and real estate markets in general. A return to these conditions or a general decline in economic conditions could result in more limited demand for the construction of new housing, and weakness in home pricing, and could ultimately result in increased delinquencies on the Bank\u2019s residential real estate loans, commercial real estate loans, commercial business loans, home equity loans and lines of credit and consumer loans. These conditions may also cause a further reduction in loan demand, and increases in the Bank\u2019s non-performing assets, net charge-offs and provisions for loan losses, as well as adversely affect the Company\u2019s liquidity and the willingness of certain counterparties and customers to do business with the Company. Negative developments in the financial services industry and the domestic and international credit markets may significantly affect the markets in which the Company does business, the market for and value of the loans and investments, and ongoing operations, costs and profitability. Moreover, declines in the stock market in general, or stock values of financial institutions and their holding companies specifically, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s stock performance.\nActs of terrorism, severe weather, natural disasters, pandemics, public health issues and other external events could impact the Company\u2019s ability to conduct business.\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to risk from external events that could affect the stability of the Bank\u2019s deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue, and/or cause the Company to incur additional expenses. For example, financial institutions have been, and continue to be, targets of terrorist threats aimed at compromising their operating and communication systems. Additionally, there could be sudden increases in electrical, telecommunications or other major physical infrastructure outages, natural disasters, the emergence of widespread health emergencies or pandemics, events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts, and cyber-attacks. Events such as these may become more common in the future and could cause significant damage, such as disrupt power and communication services, impact the stability of the Company\u2019s facilities and result in additional expenses, impair the ability of the Bank\u2019s borrowers to repay their loans and reduce the value of collateral securing the repayment of the Bank\u2019s loans, which could result in the loss of revenue. While the Company has established and regularly test disaster recovery procedures, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, operations and financial condition.\nChanges in the valuation of the Company\u2019s securities portfolio could adversely affect the Company.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company\u2019s investment securities portfolio, which includes government agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, municipal obligations, corporate bonds and marketable equity securities totaled $164.3 million, or 16.7% of the Company\u2019s total assets. The Company\u2019s securities portfolio may be impacted by fluctuations in market value, potentially reducing earnings. Fluctuations in market value may be caused by changes in market interest rates, lower market prices for securities and limited investor demand. Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis, with more frequent evaluation for selected issues. In analyzing a debt issuer\u2019s financial condition, management considers whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies, whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, industry analysts\u2019 reports and, to a lesser extent given the relatively insignificant levels of depreciation in the Company\u2019s debt portfolio, spread differentials between the effective\nrates on instruments in the portfolio compared to risk-free rates. Changes in interest rates can also have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, as the Company\u2019s available-for-sale securities are reported at their estimated fair value, and therefore are impacted by fluctuations in interest rates. The declines in fair value could result in charges to earnings that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s net income and capital levels.\nFinancial reform legislation has increased the Company\u2019s costs of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act has significantly changed the regulation of banks and savings institutions and affects the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act required various federal agencies and regulators to adopt a broad range of new rules and regulations intended to place significant restrictions and requirements on financial institutions and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. Almost immediately following the 2016 election, the Administration indicated they would support plans for Dodd-Frank reform. In 2018 the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (\u201cS. 2155\u201d) was passed by Congress and signed by the President. While S. 2155 provided some regulatory relief for mortgage lending, regulatory reporting and length of examination cycles, capital requirements and appraisals, among others, it did not impact most of the restrictions and requirements in the Dodd-Frank Act. While there are efforts for more reform of Dodd-Frank, the Company cannot predict whether those efforts will be successful and the extent to how those changes will impact business, operations or financial condition. However, compliance with the remaining provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations and policies continue to have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s business and operations, as well as additional costs, and have diverted management's time from other business activities, which adversely affects the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe short-term and long-term impact of the changing regulatory capital requirements and new capital rules may adversely affect the Company\u2019s returns on equity and ability to pay dividends or repurchase stock.\nIn July 2013, the FDIC and the other federal bank regulatory agencies revised their leverage and risk-based capital requirements and the method for calculating risk-weighted assets to make them consistent with agreements that were reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Among other things, the rule established a new common equity Tier 1 minimum capital requirement (4.5% of risk-weighted assets), set the leverage ratio at a uniform 4% of total assets, increased the minimum Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets requirement (from 4% to 6% of risk-weighted assets) and assigned a higher risk weight (150%) to certain exposures that are more than 90 days past due or are on nonaccrual status and to certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property. The rule limits a banking organization\u2019s capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers if the banking organization does not hold a \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d consisting of 2.50% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets in addition to the amount necessary to meet minimum risk-based capital requirements. The final rule became effective January 1, 2015. The \u201ccapital conservation buffer was fully phased in at 2.50% on January 1, 2019.\nThe application of these more stringent capital requirements could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, and result in regulatory actions if the Company was to be unable to comply with such requirements. Furthermore, the imposition of liquidity requirements in connection with the implementation of Basel III could result in the Company having to lengthen the term of funding, restructure business models, and/or increase holdings of liquid assets.\nGovernment responses to economic conditions may adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations, financial condition and earnings.\nThe Company is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve Board. Such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which an institution and its holding company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and the depositors and borrowers of the Bank rather than for holders of the Company\u2019s common stock. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on the Company\u2019s operations,\nthe classification of assets and determination of the level of allowance for loan losses. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material impact on the Company\u2019s operations.\nFinancial reform legislation has changed the bank regulatory framework, created an independent consumer protection bureau that has assumed the consumer protection responsibilities of the various federal banking agencies, and established more stringent capital standards for banks and bank holding companies. The legislation has also resulted in new regulations affecting the lending, funding, trading and investment activities of banks and bank holding companies. Bank regulatory agencies also have been responding aggressively to concerns and adverse trends identified in examinations. Ongoing uncertainty regarding the effect of new legislation and regulatory actions may adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations by restricting business activities, including the ability to originate or sell loans, modify loan terms, or foreclose on property securing loans. These measures are likely to increase the Company\u2019s costs of doing business and may have a significant adverse effect on lending activities, financial performance and operating flexibility. In addition, these risks could affect the performance and value of the Company\u2019s loan and investment securities portfolios, which also would negatively affect the Company\u2019s financial performance.\nIn addition, there have been proposals made by members of Congress and others that would reduce the amount distressed borrowers are otherwise contractually obligated to pay under their mortgage loans and limit an institution\u2019s ability to foreclose on mortgage collateral. Were proposals such as these, or other proposals limiting the Company\u2019s rights as a creditor, to be implemented, the Company could experience increased credit losses or increased expense in pursuing remedies as a creditor.\nA New Accounting Standard May Require the Bank to Increase the Allowance For Loan Losses and May Have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company\u2019s Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board has adopted a new accounting standard that will be effective for the Company for the 2023 fiscal year. This standard, referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL, will require financial institutions to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans, and recognize the expected credit losses as allowances for loan losses. This will change the current method of providing allowances for loan losses that are probable, which may require the Bank to increase the allowance for loan losses, and to greatly increase the types of data it would need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses. Any increase in the Bank\u2019s allowance for loan losses or expenses incurred to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s Business Is Reliant on Outside Vendors.\nThe Company\u2019s business is highly dependent on the use of certain outside vendors for day-to-day operations. The Company\u2019s operations are exposed to risk that a vendor may not perform in accordance with established performance standards required in the agreements for any number of reasons including a change in their senior management, their financial condition, their product line or mix and how they support existing customers, or a simple change in their strategic focus. While the Company has comprehensive policies and procedures in place to mitigate risk at all phases of vendor management from selection, to performance monitoring and renewals, the failure of a vendor to perform in accordance with contractual agreements could be disruptive to business, which could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations.\nDevelopment of New Products and Services May Impose Additional Costs on the Company and May Expose It to Increased Operational Risk.\nThe Company\u2019s financial performance depends, in part, on the ability to develop and market new and innovative services and to adopt or develop new technologies that differentiate products or provide cost efficiencies, while avoiding increased related expenses. This dependency is exacerbated in the current \u201cFinTech\u201d environment, where financial institutions are investing significantly in evaluating new technologies, such as artificial intelligence and digital delivery channels, and developing potentially industry-changing new products, services and industry standards. The introduction of new products and services can entail significant time and resources, including regulatory approvals. Substantial risks and uncertainties are associated with the\nintroduction of new products and services, including technical and control requirements that may need to be developed and implemented, rapid technological change in the industry. The Company\u2019s ability to access technical and other information from clients, the significant and ongoing investments required to bring new products and services to market in a timely manner at competitive prices and the preparation of marketing, sales and other materials that fully and accurately describe the product or service and underlying risks. The Company\u2019s failure to manage these risks and uncertainties also exposes it to enhanced risk of operational lapses which may result in the recognition of financial statement liabilities. Regulatory and internal control requirements, capital requirements, competitive alternatives, vendor relationships and shifting market preferences may also determine if such initiatives can be brought to market in a manner that is timely and attractive to the Company\u2019s clients. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new products or services could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and reputation, as well as on consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\nThe flattening or inversion of the yield curve may adversely affect the Company\u2019s net interest income and profitability.\nIn 2017 and 2018 the Federal Reserve Board increased the federal funds target rate by 200 basis points, which resulted in increased in short-term rates, such as the cost of deposits the cost of overnight borrowings, while long-term rates on loans and securities did not rise as much, resulting in a flattening of the yield curve. In 2019, the Federal Reserve decreased the federal funds target rate by 75 basis points. Nevertheless, the yield curve continued to remain flat. A flat yield curve combined with low interest rates generally leads to lower revenue and reduced margins because it tends to limit the Company\u2019s ability to increase the spread between asset yields and funding costs. Sustained periods of time with a flat yield curve coupled with low interest rates, or an inversion of the yield curve, could have a material effect on the Company\u2019s net interest margin and earnings.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends is subject to limitations.\nThe merger agreement between the Standard and Allegheny Valley contemplated that, unless 75% of the Board of Directors determines otherwise for the two years following the closing of the merger and 662\u22153% of the Board of Directors for the three years thereafter, the combined company will pay a quarterly cash dividend in an amount no less than $0.221 per share for five years after the effective time of the merger, provided that sufficient funds are legally available, and that the Company and the Bank remain \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d in accordance with applicable regulatory guidelines.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends depends on the receipt of dividends from direct and indirect subsidiaries. The Bank is the Company\u2019s primary source of dividends. As a state-chartered bank, the Bank is subject to regulatory restrictions on the payment and amounts of dividends under the Pennsylvania Banking Code.\nFurther, the ability of banking subsidiaries to pay dividends is also subject to their profitability, financial condition, capital expenditures and other cash flow requirements. There is no assurance that the Company\u2019s subsidiaries will be able to pay the dividends contemplated by the merger agreement or other dividends in the future or that the Company will generate adequate cash flow to pay dividends in the future. The Company\u2019s failure to pay dividends on common stock could have a material adverse effect on the market price of the common stock.\nThe Company will continue to incur significant costs to ensure compliance with corporate governance and accounting requirements.\nThe Company expects to continue to incur significant costs associated with public company reporting requirements, costs associated with applicable corporate governance requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other rules implemented by the SEC. The Company expects all of these applicable rules and regulations will continue to increase legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly.\nThe Company\u2019s success will depend upon the ability of management to attract and retain talent.\nThe business success of the Company and the Bank depends to a great extent upon the services of their directors and executive officers. Management\u2019s ability to operate the Company profitably will require the acquisition of new knowledge and skills. In particular, if the Company expands geographically or expands to provide non-banking services through the acquisition or formation of additional subsidiaries, current management may not have the necessary experience for successful operation in these new areas. There is no guarantee that management would be able to meet these new challenges or that the Company would be able to retain new directors or personnel with the appropriate background and expertise.\nStrong competition within the Company\u2019s market areas may limit growth and profitability.\nCompetition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. In the Company\u2019s market areas it competes with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere. Some of the Company\u2019s competitors have greater name recognition and market presence that benefits them in attracting business, and offer certain services that the Company does not or cannot provide. In addition, larger competitors may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively than the Company does, which could affect the ability to grow and remain profitable on a long-term basis. The Company\u2019s profitability depends upon its continued ability to successfully compete in its market areas. This could become increasingly difficult if some competitors in the Bank\u2019s market areas price loans and deposits irrationally. If the Company must raise interest rates paid on deposits or lower interest rates charged on loans, the net interest margin and profitability could be adversely affected. For additional information see \u201cItem 1\u2009-\u2009Business\u2009-\u2009Standard Bank\u2009-\u2009Competition.\u201d\nThe Company may be adversely affected by recent changes in U.S. tax laws.\nChanges in tax laws contained in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was enacted in December 2017, include a number of provisions that will have an impact on the banking industry, borrowers and the market for single-family residential real estate. Changes include (i) a lower limit on the deductibility of mortgage interest on single-family residential mortgage loans, (ii) the elimination of interest deductions for certain home equity loans, (iii) a limitation on the deductibility of business interest expense and (iv) a limitation on the deductibility of property taxes and state and local income taxes.\nThe recent changes in the tax laws may have an adverse effect on the market for, and valuation of, residential properties, and on the demand for such loans in the future, and could make it harder for borrowers to make their loan payments. In addition, these recent changes may also have a disproportionate effect on taxpayers in states with high residential home prices and high state and local taxes. If home ownership becomes less attractive, demand for mortgage loans could decrease. The value of the properties securing loans in the Bank\u2019s loan portfolio may be adversely impacted as a result of the changing economics of home ownership, which could require an increase in the Bank\u2019s provision for loan losses, which would reduce the Company\u2019s profitability and could materially adversely affect business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA failure in or breach of the Company\u2019s operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could disrupt the Company\u2019s businesses, and adversely impact the results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, as well as cause reputational harm.\nThe Company collects, processes and stores sensitive consumer data by utilizing computer systems and telecommunications networks operated by both the Bank and third-party service providers. The Company\u2019s operational and security systems, infrastructure, including computer systems, data management, and internal processes, as well as those of third parties, are integral to the Company\u2019s business. The Company relies on employees and third parties in day-to-day and ongoing operations, who may, as a result of human error, misconduct or malfeasance, or failure or breach of third- party systems or infrastructure, expose the Company to risk. The Company has taken measures to implement backup systems and other safeguards to support operations, but the ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant\ndisruptions to the Company or to third parties with whom it interacts. In addition, the Company\u2019s ability to implement backup systems and other safeguards with respect to third-party systems is more limited than with its own systems.\nThe Company handles a substantial volume of customer and other financial transactions every day. The Company\u2019s financial, accounting, data processing, check processing, electronic funds transfer, loan processing, online and mobile banking, automated teller machines, or ATMs, backup or other operating or security systems and infrastructure may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond its control. This could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to process these transactions or provide these services. There could be sudden increases in customer transaction volume, electrical, telecommunications or other major physical infrastructure outages, natural disasters, events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts, and cyber attacks. The Company continuously updates these systems to support operations and growth. This updating entails significant costs and creates risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones. Operational risk exposures could adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, and cause reputational harm.\nA cyber attack, information or security breach, or a technology failure of the Company\u2019s or of a third-party could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to conduct business or manage exposure to risk, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, increase the Company\u2019s costs to maintain and update operational and security systems and infrastructure, and adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, as well as cause reputational harm.\nThe Company\u2019s business is highly dependent on the security and efficacy of its infrastructure, computer and data management systems, as well as those of third parties with whom it interacts. Cyber security risks for financial institutions have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists and other external parties, including foreign state actors. The Company\u2019s operations rely on the secure processing, transmission, storage and retrieval of confidential, proprietary and other information in computer and data management systems and networks, and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third parties. The Company relies on digital technologies, computer, database and email systems, software, and networks to conduct operations. In addition, to access the Company\u2019s network, products and services, customers and third parties may use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of the Company\u2019s network environment.\nFinancial services institutions have been subject to, and are likely to continue to be the target of, cyber attacks, including computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, phishing attacks, denial of service or other security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary and other information of the institution, employees or customers of third parties, or otherwise materially disrupt network access or business operations. For example, denial of service attacks have been launched against a number of large financial institutions and several large retailers have disclosed substantial cyber security breaches affecting debit and credit card accounts of their customers. The Company has experienced cyber security incidents in the past, although not material, and it anticipates that, as a larger bank, it could experience further incidents. There can be no assurance that the Company will not suffer material losses or other material consequences relating to technology failure, cyber attacks or other information or security breaches.\nMisconduct by employees could also result in fraudulent, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of clients or improper use of confidential information. The Company may not be able to prevent employee errors or misconduct, and the precautions the Company takes to detect this type of activity might not be effective in all cases. Employee errors or misconduct could subject the Company to civil claims for negligence or regulatory enforcement actions, including fines and restrictions on business.\nIn addition, there have been instances where financial institutions have been victims of fraudulent activity in which criminals pose as customers to initiate wire and automated clearinghouse transactions out of customer accounts. The recent massive breach of the systems of a credit bureau presents additional threats as criminals now have more information about a larger portion of the population of the United States\nthan past breaches have involved, which could be used by criminals to pose as customers initiating transfers of money from customer accounts. Although the Company has policies and procedures in place to verify the authenticity of customers, the Company cannot assure that such policies and procedures will prevent all fraudulent transfers. Such activity can result in financial liability and harm to its reputation.\nAs cyber threats and other fraudulent activity continues to evolve, the Company may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify and enhance protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents. Any of these matters could result in the Company\u2019s loss of customers and business opportunities, significant disruption to operations and business, misappropriation or destruction of confidential information and/or that of its customers, or damage to customers\u2019 and/or third parties\u2019 computers or systems, and could result in a violation of applicable privacy laws and other laws, litigation exposure, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, loss of confidence in security measures, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, and additional compliance costs. In addition, any of the matters described above could adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s stock price may be volatile due to limited trading volume.\nThe Company\u2019s common stock is quoted on the NASDAQ market place. However, the average daily trading volume in the Company\u2019s common stock has been relatively small. As a result, trades involving a relatively small number of shares may have a significant effect on the market price of the common stock, and it may be difficult for investors to acquire or dispose of large blocks of stock without significantly affecting the market price.", "PERMNO": 12362, "SIC": 6036, "TIC": "STND"}
