RISK FACTORS\nWe are subject to various risks that may materially harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. This discussion highlights some of the risks that may affect future operating results. These are the risks and uncertainties we believe are most important for you to consider. We cannot be certain that we will successfully address these risks. If we are unable to address these risks, our business may not grow, our stock price may suffer, and we may be unable to stay in business. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, which we currently deem immaterial or which are similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or business in general, may also impair our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. The risks discussed below include forward-looking statements, and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements.\nReduction in present levels of cash flow could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s primary source of liquidity historically has been operating cash flows. The Company\u2019s future cash flows from operations (on both a short-term and long-term basis) are dependent upon the following factors, among others:\n\u25cf\nthe Company\u2019s ability to attract new customers that will sell the Company\u2019s products and pay for them;\n\u25cf\nthe Company\u2019s ability to retain its existing customers at the level of sales previously produced;\n\u25cf\nthe volume of sales for these customers;\n\u25cf\nmaintaining business from one or more primary customers;\nSimilarly, the Company\u2019s future cash flows from operations are subject to the following risks and, among others:\n\u25cf\nchanges in types of products that customers purchase in their sales mix;\n\u25cf\npoor or deteriorating economic conditions which would directly impact the ability of the Company\u2019s customers to remain in business and pay for their products on a timely basis;\n\u25cf\nmanagement\u2019s ability to minimize the impact of requests for increases in material or labor cost; and\n\u25cf\nthe ability to collect in full and in a timely manner amounts due to the Company.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s cash flow is also dependent, to some extent, upon the ability to maintain operating margins. The continuing general downturn in economic conditions or other events that may have caused or cause the Company\u2019s customers to turn to lower-priced, lower-margin products could cause the Company\u2019s cash flow and profitability to be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are dependent on the proper functioning of our critical facilities, our contract manufacturers in China, our supply chain and distribution networks and the financial stability of our customers, all of which have been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in a manner that may have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur ability to produce products may be materially adversely impacted by COVID-19.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is impacting worldwide economic activity, which has had a corresponding effect on our sales activity. The virus continues to spread globally, has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and has spread to over 100 countries, including the United States. The impact of this pandemic has been and will likely continue to be extensive in many aspects of society, and has resulted in and will likely continue to result in significant disruptions to the global economy, as well as businesses and capital markets around the world. With the ongoing effect of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States and other countries, it is unclear how economic activity and workflows will continue to be impacted and for how long. Many employers are requiring their employees to work from home or not come into their offices or facilities. We produce certain stereo headphones out of one facility in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In order to mitigate the risk posed by COVID-19, we have implemented social distancing measures, mask policies, including when warranted by state and local guidelines, and the implementation of new staffing plans in our facilities whereby certain employees work remotely. Our actions continue to evolve in response to new government measures and scientific knowledge regarding COVID-19. To date, these protocols have not resulted in a decrease in the production capabilities of our facility. However, if the manufacturing capabilities of this facility are adversely impacted as a result of COVID-19, whether by a decrease in productivity caused by precautionary measures or by one or more employees becoming ill, it may not be possible for us to timely produce relevant products at required levels or at all. A reduction or interruption in any of our manufacturing processes could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe also might be unable to obtain certain supplies, product components, or equipment from our suppliers and vendors due to constraints created by COVID-19. For instance, we have observed delays in certain suppliers\u2019 deliveries of materials necessary for our contract manufacturers to manufacture our products. Additionally, travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders or similar mandates of foreign and domestic governments have prevented US based employees from visiting suppliers\u2019 facilities as part of our quality control processes. These impacts may delay our launch of new products, adversely affect our ability to deliver customers\u2019 orders timely or in the requested quantities and inhibit our ability to ensure the quality of supplies used in our products.\nOur sales may be materially adversely impacted by COVID-19.\nOur sales efforts include in-person meetings with customers and potential customers to discuss our products. Additionally, much of our customers\u2019 sales are conducted in-person by consumers purchasing our products in brick-and-mortar stores. The method and timing of these meetings and the ability of our customers to make in-person sales have been altered due to stay-at-home orders and travel restrictions relating to COVID-19. This limitation on the ability of our sales personnel and our customers to maintain their customary interaction with customers and consumers may negatively affect demand for our products and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nFailure to attract and retain customers to sell the Company\u2019s products could adversely affect sales volume and future profitability.\nThe Company markets a line of products used by consumers to listen to music. The Company distributes these products through retail channels in the U.S. and independent distributors throughout the rest of the world. The Company is dependent upon its ability to attract and retain a base of customers to sell the Company\u2019s line of products. The Company has broad distribution across many channels including specialty stores, mass merchants, electronics stores and computer retailers. The Company may not be able to maintain customers or model selections and therefore may experience a reduction in its sales revenue until a model is restored to the mix or a lost customer is replaced by a new customer. The loss of business of one or more principal customers or a change in the sales volume from a particular customer could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s sales volume and profitability.\nA shift in customer specifications to lower priced items can reduce profit margins, negatively impacting profitability.\nThe Company sells a line of products with a suggested retail prices ranging from less than $10 up to $1,000. The gross margin for each of these models varies in terms of percentages. The Company finds the low-priced portion of the market most competitive and therefore most subject to pressure on gross margin percentages, which tends to lower profit contributions. Therefore, a shift in retail customer specifications and preferences toward lower priced items could lead to lower gross margins and lower profit contributions per unit of sale. Due to the range of products that the Company sells, the product sales mix can produce a variation in profit margins. Some distributors sell a limited range of products that yield lower profit margins than others. Most notably, the budget-priced stereo headphone segment of the market (below $10 retail), which is distributed through mass market retailers, computer stores, and office supply stores tends to yield the lowest gross margins. An increase in business with these types of accounts, if coupled with a simultaneous reduction in sales to customers with higher gross margins, would reduce profit margins and profitability.\nIf we are unable to continue to develop innovative and popular products, our brand image may be harmed and demand for our products may decrease.\nConsumer electronics are subject to constantly and rapidly changing consumer preferences based on industry trends and performance features, including technological advancement. Our success depends largely on our ability to lead, anticipate, gauge and respond to these changing consumer preferences and trends in a timely manner, while preserving and strengthening the perception and authenticity of our brand. We must continue to develop high performance products that provide better design and performance attributes than the products of our competitors at similar price points. Market acceptance of new designs and products is subject to uncertainty and we cannot assure you that our efforts will be successful. The inability of new product designs or new product lines to gain market acceptance, or our current products losing traction in the market, could adversely affect our brand image, our business and financial condition. Achieving market acceptance for new products may also require substantial marketing efforts and expenditures to increase consumer demand, which could constrain our management, financial and operational resources. If new products we introduce do not experience broad market acceptance or demand for our existing products wanes, our net sales and market share could decline.\nWe may not be able to compete effectively, which could cause our net sales and market share to decline.\nThe consumer electronics industry is highly competitive, and characterized by frequent introduction of new competitors, as well as increased competition from established companies expanding their product portfolio, aggressive price cutting and resulting downward pressure on gross margins and rapid consolidation of the market resulting in larger competitors. We face competition from consumer electronics brands that have historically dominated the stereo headphone market, in addition to sport brand and lifestyle companies that also produce headphone products. These companies include, among others, Apple, Sony, Bose, LG and Samsung. These competitors may have significant competitive advantages, including greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources, longer operating histories, better brand recognition among certain groups of consumers, and greater economies of scale. In addition, these competitors have long-term relationships with many of our larger retailers that are potentially more important to those retailers. As a result, these competitors may be better equipped to influence consumer preferences or otherwise increase their market share by:\n\u25cf\nquickly adapting to changes in consumer preferences;\n\u25cf\nreadily taking advantage of acquisition and other opportunities;\n\u25cf\ndiscounting excess inventory;\n\u25cf\ndevoting greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products, including significant advertising, media placement and product endorsement;\n\u25cf\nadopting aggressive pricing policies; and\n\u25cf\nengaging in lengthy and costly intellectual property and other legal disputes.\nAdditionally, the industry in which we compete generally has low barriers to entry that allow the introduction of new products or new competitors at a fast pace. Some retailers have begun to introduce their own private label headphones, which could reduce the volume of product they buy from us, as well as decrease the shelf space they allocate to our products. If we are unable to protect our brand image and authenticity, while carefully balancing our growth, we may be unable to effectively compete with these new market entrants or new products. The inability to compete effectively against new and existing competitors could have an adverse effect on our net sales and results of operations, preventing us from achieving future growth.\nIf we are unable to obtain intellectual property rights and/or enforce those rights against third parties who are violating those rights, including by obtaining a favorable outcome in litigation in which we are currently engaged, our business could suffer.\nWe rely on various intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks, trade secrets and trade dress to protect our brand name, reputation, product appearance and technology. If we fail to obtain, maintain, or in some cases enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitors may be able to copy our designs, or use our brand name, trademarks or technology. As a result, if we are unable to successfully protect our intellectual property rights, or resolve any conflicts effectively, our results of operations may be harmed. In order to enforce our intellectual property rights, we recently filed complaints against certain parties alleging infringement on patents relating to our wireless audio technology. All litigation is uncertain, and there can be no assurance that any of this litigation will be decided in our favor. Regardless of the merits of the claims, litigation may be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to our operations and distracting to management. If resolved against us, such legal proceedings could result in excessive verdicts, injunctive relief or other equitable relief that may affect how we operate our business. Similarly, if we settle such legal proceedings, it may negatively affect how we operate our business.\nWe may be adversely affected by the financial condition of our retailers and distributors.\nSome of our retailers and distributors are experiencing financial difficulties as a result of current adverse economic conditions. A retailer or distributor experiencing such difficulties generally will not purchase and sell as many of our products as it would under normal circumstances and may cancel orders. In addition, a retailer or distributor experiencing financial difficulties generally increases our exposure to uncollectible receivables. We extend credit to our retailers and distributors based on our assessment of their financial condition, generally without requiring collateral, and sometimes are not able to obtain information regarding their current financial status. Failure of these retailers or distributors to remain current on their obligations to us could result in losses that exceed the reserves we set aside in anticipation of this risk. We are also exposed to the risk of our customers declaring bankruptcy, exposing us to claims of preferential payment claims. Financial difficulties on the part of our retailers or distributors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOne of our customer\u2019s accounts for a significant amount of our net sales, and the loss of, or reduced purchases from, this or other customers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur largest customer, Wal-Mart, accounted for more than 18% and 18% of our net sales in fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. We do not have long-term contracts with any of our customers and all of our customers generally purchase from us on a purchase order basis. As a result, this customer generally may, with no notice or penalty, cease ordering and selling our products, or materially reduce its orders. If certain customers, individually or in the aggregate, choose to no longer sell our products, to slow their rate of purchase of our products or to decrease the number of products they purchase, our results of operations would be adversely affected.\nCompany profits can suffer from interruption in its supply chain.\nThe Company uses contract manufacturing facilities in the People\u2019s Republic of China, Taiwan and South Korea. The Company is at risk of business interruptions due to natural disaster, war, disease and government intervention through tariffs or trade restrictions, which lately have become of increased concern in these areas. Therefore, any interruptions in the supply chain for any of these reasons could directly impact the Company\u2019s profits in a material, negative way. The Company is also at risk if trade restrictions are imposed on the Company\u2019s products based upon country of origin. In addition, the Company may not be able to pass along most increases in tariffs and freight charges to the Company\u2019s customers, which would directly affect profits.\nEconomic regulation, trade restrictions, and increasing manufacturing costs in China could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nThe Company uses contract manufacturing facilities in the People\u2019s Republic of China. For many years, the Chinese economy has experienced periods of rapid growth. An increase in the cost of labor or taxes on wages in China may lead to an increase in the cost of goods manufactured in China. Significant increases in wages or wage taxes paid by contract manufacturing facilities may increase the cost of goods manufactured in China which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s profit margins and profitability. Additionally, government trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs, export restrictions, sanctions or other retaliatory measures could limit our ability to source materials and products from China at acceptable prices or at all. We do not currently have arrangements with contract manufacturers in other countries that may be acceptable substitutes. We cannot predict what actions may ultimately be taken with respect to tariffs, export controls, countermeasures, or other trade measures between the U.S. and China or other countries and what products may be subject to such actions. To the extent such actions inhibit our transactions with contract manufacturing facilities and suppliers in China, our business may be materially adversely affected.\nWe may be subject to risks related to doing business in, and having counterparties based in, foreign countries.\nWe engage in operations, and enter into agreements with counterparties, located outside the U.S., which exposes us to political, governmental and economic instability and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Any disruption caused by these factors could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and prospects. Risks associated with potential operations, commitments and investments outside of the U.S. include but are not limited to risks of:\n\u25cf\nglobal and local economic, social and political conditions and uncertainty;\n\u25cf\ncurrency exchange restrictions and currency fluctuations;\n\u25cf\nwar or terrorist attack;\n\u25cf\nlocal outbreak of disease, such as COVID-19;\n\u25cf\nrenegotiation or nullification of existing contracts or international trade arrangements;\n\u25cf\nlabor market conditions and workers\u2019 rights affecting our manufacturing operations or those of our customers;\n\u25cf\nmacro-economic conditions impacting key markets and sources of supply;\n\u25cf\nchanging laws and policies affecting trade, taxation, financial regulation, immigration, and investment;\n\u25cf\ncompliance with laws and regulations that differ among jurisdictions, including those covering taxes, intellectual property ownership and infringement, imports and exports, anti-corruption and anti-bribery, antitrust and competition, data privacy, and environment, health, and safety; and\n\u25cf\ngeneral hazards associated with the assertion of sovereignty over areas in which operations are conducted, transactions occur, or counterparties are located.\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates could affect the Company\u2019s financial results and operations, including with respect to pricing of products and overall demand for the Company\u2019s products.\nThe Company receives a material portion of its sales and profits from business in Europe. To the extent that the value of the U.S. dollar increases relative to currencies in those jurisdictions, it increases the cost of the Company\u2019s products in those jurisdictions, which could create negative pressure on the foreign demand for the Company\u2019s products. The Company is paid by its international customers in U.S. dollars. To the extent that increased prices arising from currency fluctuations decrease the overall demand for the Company\u2019s products or motivate customers to purchase lower-priced, lower profit products, the Company\u2019s sales, profits and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nOur products may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and operating margin and harm to our reputation.\nFrom time to time, our products may contain design and manufacturing defects. There can be no assurance we will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware we sell. Failure to do so could result in lost revenue, significant warranty and other expenses, and harm to our reputation.\nAn information systems interruption or breach in security could adversely affect us.\nPrivacy, security, and compliance concerns have continued to increase as technology has evolved. We rely on accounting, financial and operational management information systems to conduct our operations. Any disruption in these systems could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. Furthermore, as part of our normal business activities, we collect and store common confidential information about customers, employees, vendors, and suppliers. This information is entitled to protection under a number of regulatory regimes. Any failure to maintain the security of the data, including the penetration of our network security and the misappropriation of confidential and personal information, could result in business disruption, damage to our reputation, financial obligations to third parties, fines, penalties, regulatory proceedings and private litigation with potentially large costs, and also result in deterioration in customers confidence in us and other competitive disadvantages, and thus could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur stock price is subject to volatility.\nOur stock is subject to substantial price volatility. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry, and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to companies' operating performance. Factors such as the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock, investor perceptions of us and our business, actions by institutional shareholders, strategic actions by us, litigation, changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations and principles, additions or departures of key personnel and our results of operations, financial performance and future prospects may cause the market price and demand for our common stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent investors from realizing the liquidity of their shares.\nChanges in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States. Our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors, including: changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws. We regularly assess all of these matters to determine the adequacy of our tax provision.", "PERMNO": 48072, "SIC": 3651, "TIC": "KOSS"}
