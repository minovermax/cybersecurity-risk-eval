{"cik": "1409375", "company": "ORION ENERGY SYSTEMS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-06-12", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below and in other reports that we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The matters discussed in the following risk factors, and additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and future growth prospects and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nThe success of our business depends upon our adaptation to the changing market conditions in the lighting industry and on market acceptance of our lighting retrofit solutions using new LED technologies.\nSince we believe that the market for lighting products is currently experiencing a significant technology shift to LED lighting systems, we are increasingly focusing our business on providing lighting retrofit solutions using new LED technologies in lieu of traditional HIF lighting upon which our business has historically relied.\nAs a result, our future success depends significantly upon the adoption rate of LED products within our primary markets and our ability to participate in this anticipated market trend. To be an effective participant in this expected growing LED market opportunity, we must keep up with the evolution of LED technology, which has been moving at a fast pace. We may be unable to successfully develop and market new LED products or services that keep pace with technological or industry changes, satisfy changes in customer demands or comply with present or emerging government and industry regulations and technology standards. The development and introduction of new LED products may result in increased warranty expenses and other new product introduction expenses. In addition, we will incur substantial costs to research and develop new LED products, which will increase our expenses, without guarantee that our products and services will be commercially viable. We may also spend time and resources to develop and release new LED products only to discover that a competitor has also introduced similar new products with superior performance. Moreover, if the market shift to LED lighting does not occur or new sources of lighting are developed, our current products and technologies could become less competitive or obsolete, which could result in reduced revenue, reduced earnings or increased losses and/or inventory and other impairment charges. Additionally, as the lighting retrofit market continues to shift to LED lighting products from HIF and other traditional lighting products, customer purchasing decisions have been delayed as they evaluate the relative advantages and disadvantages of the lighting retrofit product alternatives and wait for further decreases in the price of LED lighting products. These circumstances have led, and may continue to lead, to reduced revenue for us in the periods affected. Our primary focus on selling our generally lower margin LED products to our retrofit customers in the future in\nlieu of our traditional HIF lighting products will likely also lead to reduced revenues for our generally higher margin HIF products, thus increasing our reliance on our new LED products and potentially resulting in inventory or other impairment charges.\nAs we attempt to adapt our business organization to this quickly evolving market, we are considering implementing significant changes to our manufacturing operations to increase our flexibility, remain competitive and lower our cost structure, including the sale and leaseback of our manufacturing and corporate facilities. Implementing these initiatives will result in our incurring additional cost and expenses, including asset impairment or write-down charges and other repositioning expenses and charges, which would likely materially adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, we have been managing through significant change in our vendor supply chain as LED product portfolio and our product revenue continue to increase and we place more focus on this product line. We currently believe that our recent efforts to negotiate further lower material input costs will improve our LED product gross margins beginning during our fiscal 2016. However, we may not be able to realize the gross margin benefits in the amounts or on the timetable anticipated and we may experience higher warranty expenses in the future as we implement our manufacturing and assembly process changes. It is also possible that, as we continue to focus our sales efforts on our LED product lines, we may increase our risk of inventory obsolescence for our legacy lighting product lines or even for outmoded LED products.\nFinally, in connection with our primary focus on selling our LED products in the future, we expect our results of operations to fluctuate from quarter to quarter as customers may continue to delay purchasing decisions as they evaluate their return on investment from purchasing new LED products compared to alternative lighting solutions, the pricing of LED products continues to fall and LED products continue to gain more widespread customer acceptance. Similarly, these circumstances have impacted, and may continue to, adversely impact, our product gross margins and our profitability from quarter to quarter.\nIf we are unable to achieve market acceptance of our lighting retrofit solutions using new LED technologies or realize the expected benefits from our conversion to LED technologies, our results of operations and financial condition will likely be materially adversely affected.\nThe success of our LED lighting retrofit solutions depend in part on our ability to claim market share ahead of our competitors.\nParticipants in the LED market who are able to quickly establish customer relationships and achieve market penetration are likely to gain a competitive advantage as the lighting retrofit solutions offered by us and our competitors generally have a product life of several years following installation. If we are unable to establish customer relationships and achieve market penetration in the LED market in a timely manner, we may lose the opportunity to market our LED products and services to significant portions of the lighting systems retrofit market for several years and may be at a disadvantage in securing future business opportunities from customers that have previously established relationships with one or more of our competitors. These disadvantages could reduce our revenue and profitability, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAdverse conditions in the global economy have negatively impacted, and could continue to negatively impact, our customers, suppliers and business.\nContinued weak economic conditions have adversely affected our customers\u2019 capital budgets, purchasing decisions and facilities managers and, therefore, have adversely affected our results of operations. The return to a recessionary state of the global economy could potentially have negative effects on our near-term liquidity and capital resources, including slower collections of receivables, delays of existing order deliveries and postponements of incoming orders.Our business and results of operations will continue to be adversely affected to the extent these adverse economic conditions continue to adversely affect our customers\u2019 purchasing decisions.\nAdverse market conditions have led to increasing duration of customer sales cycles, limitations on customer capital budgets, project delays, closure of facilities and the loss of key contacts due to workforce reductions at existing and prospective customers.\nThe volatility and uncertainty in the financial and credit markets has led many customers to adopt strategies for conserving cash, including limits on capital spending. Our lighting systems are often purchased as capital assets and therefore are subject to capital availability. Uncertainty around such availability has led customers to delay purchase decisions, which has elongated the duration of our sales cycles. Along with limiting capital spending, some customers have reduced expenses by closing facilities and reducing workforces. As a result, facilities that were or may be considering installing our lighting systems have closed or may close. Due to downsizings, key contacts and decision-makers at some of our customers have lost or may lose their jobs, which requires us to re-initiate the sales cycle with other personnel, further elongating the sales cycle. Additionally, the federal government shutdown during our fiscal 2014 resulted in project delays for certain government projects. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, variability in our operating results, on both an annual and a quarterly basis, as a result of these factors.\nOur financial performance is dependent on our ability to execute on our strategy and increase our profitability.\nOur ability to achieve our desired growth and profitability depends on our ability to expand our reseller network, and improve our marketing, new product development, project management, margin enhancement and operating expense management,\nas well as other factors. If we are unable to successfully execute in any of these areas or on our growth and profitability strategy as a whole, our business and financial performance will likely be adversely affected.\nWe have had a history of losses and we may be unable to achieve and sustain profitability.\nWe have experienced net losses of approximately $32.1 million, $6.2 million and $10.4 million during the years ended March 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. While we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, our anticipated cash flows from operating activities and our borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months, generating net income in the future will depend on our ability to successfully complete and execute our strategy. There is no guarantee that we will be able to achieve or sustain profitability in the future. An inability to successfully achieve profitability may decrease our long-term viability.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and if we are unable to compete successfully our revenue and profitability will be adversely affected.\nWe face strong competition primarily from manufacturers and distributors of energy management products and services, as well as from electrical contractors. We compete primarily on the basis of customer relationships, price, quality, energy efficiency, customer service and marketing support. Our products are in direct competition with HID technology, as well as other HIF and LED products and older fluorescent technology in the lighting systems retrofit market.\nMany of our competitors are better capitalized than we are, have strong customer relationships, greater name recognition, and more extensive engineering, manufacturing, sales and marketing capabilities. Competitors could focus their substantial resources on developing a competing business model or energy management products or services that may be potentially more attractive to customers than our products or services. In addition, we may face competition from other products or technologies that reduce demand for electricity. Our competitors may also offer energy management products and services at reduced prices in order to improve their competitive positions. Any of these competitive factors could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain customers, require us to lower our prices in order to remain competitive, and reduce our revenue and profitability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to litigation and other legal matters that could result in charges against our income, strain our resources and distract our management, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or reputation.\nWe are involved in a variety of claims, lawsuits and other disputes. These suits concern a variety of issues, including employee-related matters and contract disputes. In March 2014, we were named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit filed by Neal R. Verfuerth, our former chief executive officer who was terminated for cause in November 2012. The plaintiff alleges, among other things, that we breached certain agreements entered into with the plaintiff, including the plaintiff\u2019s employment agreement, and violated certain laws. The complaint seeks, among other relief, unspecified pecuniary and compensatory damages, fees and such other relief as the court may deem just and proper. It is not feasible to predict the outcome of all pending suits and other matters, and the ultimate resolution of these matters, as well as future potential lawsuits, could result in liabilities, fines, significant expenses, distraction of management and other issues that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or reputation.\nOur inability to attract and retain key employees or our reseller network could adversely affect our operations and our ability to execute on our operating plan and growth strategy.\nWe rely upon the knowledge, experience and skills of key employees throughout our organization, particularly our senior management team and our sales group that require technical knowledge or contacts in, and knowledge of, the industry. In addition, our ability to attract talented new employees, particularly in our sales group, is also critical to our success. We also depend on our value-added reseller channels which has increased from 30 to 102 active key resellers during fiscal 2015. If we are unable to attract and retain key employees or our reseller network because of competition or, in the case of employees, inadequate compensation or other factors, our operations and our ability to execute our operating plan could be adversely affected.\nReductions in our workforce and employee turnover could negatively impact our business.\nWe are currently experiencing reductions in our workforce due to budget spending reductions and increased employee turnover. The reductions resulted in the loss of numerous long-term employees, along with their institutional knowledge and expertise, and the reallocation of certain employment responsibilities, all of which could adversely affect operational efficiencies, employee performance and retention. Such workforce reductions have also placed a significant burden on our current employees. In addition, the increase employee turnover has resulted in higher recruiting expenses as we seek to recruit and train employees, in addition to increased instability in our operations as responsibilities are reallocated to new or different employees. To the extent that we are unable to effectively reallocate employee responsibilities, retain key employees and reduce employee turnover, our operations and our ability to execute our operating plan could be adversely affected.\nOur products use components and raw materials that may be subject to price fluctuations, shortages or interruptions of supply.\nWe may be vulnerable to price increases for components or raw materials that we require for our products, including aluminum, copper, certain rare earth minerals, electronic drivers, chips, ballasts, power supplies and lamps. In particular, our cost of aluminum can be subject to commodity price fluctuation. Further, suppliers' inventories of certain components that our products require may be limited and are subject to acquisition by others. In the past, we have had to purchase quantities of certain components that are critical to our product manufacturing and were in excess of our estimated near-term requirements as a result of supplier delivery constraints and concerns over component availability, and we may need to do so in the future. As a result, we have had, and may need to continue, to devote additional working capital to support a large amount of component and raw material inventory that may not be used over a reasonable period to produce saleable products, and we may be required to increase our excess and obsolete inventory reserves to provide for these excess quantities, particularly if demand for our products does not meet our expectations. Also, any shortages or interruptions in supply of our components or raw materials could disrupt our operations. If any of these events occurs, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may pursue additional acquisitions and investments in new product lines, businesses or technologies that involve numerous risks, which could disrupt our business or adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may pursue additional acquisitions of, or investments in, new product lines, businesses or technologies to expand our current capabilities. We have limited experience in making such acquisitions or investments. Acquisitions present a number of potential risks and challenges that could disrupt our business operations, increase our operating costs or capital expenditure requirements and reduce the value of the acquired product line, business or technology. For example, if we identify an acquisition candidate, we may not be able to successfully negotiate or finance the acquisition on favorable terms. The process of negotiating acquisitions and integrating acquired products, services, technologies, personnel, or businesses might result in significant transaction costs, operating difficulties or unexpected expenditures, and might require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business. If we are successful in completing an acquisition, we may not be able to integrate the acquired product line, business or technology into our existing business and products, and we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of any acquisition. Furthermore, potential acquisitions and investments may divert our management's attention, require considerable cash outlays and require substantial additional expenses that could harm our existing operations and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. To complete future acquisitions, we may issue equity securities, incur debt, assume contingent liabilities or incur amortization expenses and write-downs of acquired assets, which could dilute the interests of our shareholders or adversely affect our profitability.\nWe may not be able to obtain equity capital or debt financing necessary to effectively pursue strategic acquisition opportunities or otherwise pursue our growth initiatives.\nOur existing capital resources may not be sufficient to effectively pursue strategic acquisition opportunities or to pursue other growth initiatives. We may not be able to obtain sufficient equity capital and/or debt financing required to do so or we may not be able to obtain such equity capital or debt financing on acceptable terms or conditions. Factors affecting the availability to us of equity capital or debt financing on acceptable terms and conditions include:\n\u2022\nThe price, volatility and trading volume and history of our common stock.\n\u2022\nOur current and future financial results and position.\n\u2022\nThe market\u2019s view of our industry and products.\n\u2022\nThe perception in the equity and debt markets of our ability to execute our business plan or achieve our operating results expectations.\nOur inability to obtain the capital necessary to pursue strategic acquisition opportunities or to otherwise pursue our growth opportunities could have an adverse effect on our growth strategy and business operations.\nWe depend upon a limited number of customers in any given period to generate a substantial portion of our revenue and the loss of significant customers could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nWe do not have long-term contracts with our customers, and our dependence on individual key customers can vary from period to period as a result of the significant size of some of our retrofit and multi-facility roll-out projects. Our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 45% and 36%, respectively, of our total revenue for fiscal 2014 and 2015. In fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015, our top customer accounted for 23% and 12% of our total revenues, respectively. We expect large retrofit and roll-out projects to continue to be a significant component of our total revenue. Additionally, commercial office lighting retrofits provide for single large project opportunities. As a result, we may experience more customer concentration in any given future period. The loss of, or substantial reduction in sales to, any of our significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any given future period.\nThe success of our business depends on the market acceptance of our energy management products and services.\nOur future success depends on continued commercial acceptance of our energy management products and services. If we are unable to convince current and potential customers of the advantages of our lighting systems and energy management products and services, then our ability to sell our lighting systems and energy management products and services will be limited. In addition, because the market for energy management products and services is rapidly evolving, we may not be able to accurately assess the size of the market, and we may have limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business. If the market for our lighting systems and energy management products and services does not continue to develop, or if the market does not accept our products, then our ability to grow our business could be limited and we may not be able to increase our revenue or achieve profitability.\nWe depend on our ability to develop new products and services.\nThe market for our products and services is characterized by rapid market and technological changes, uncertain product life cycles, changes in customer demands and evolving government, industry and utility standards and regulations. As a result, our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to design and manufacture new products and services. We may be unable to successfully develop and market new products or services that keep pace with technological or industry changes, satisfy changes in customer demands or comply with present or emerging government and industry regulations and technology standards.\nProduct liability claims could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face exposure to product liability claims in the event that our energy management products fail to perform as expected or cause bodily injury or property damage. Since virtually all of our products use electricity, it is possible that our products could result in injury, whether by product malfunctions, defects, improper installation or other causes. Particularly because our products often incorporate new technologies or designs, we cannot predict whether or not product liability claims will be brought against us in the future or result in negative publicity about our business or adversely affect our customer relations. Moreover, we may not have adequate resources in the event of a successful claim against us. A successful product liability claim against us that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of our available insurance limits could require us to make significant payments of damages and could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur inability to protect our intellectual property, or our involvement in damaging and disruptive intellectual property litigation, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition or result in the loss of use of the product or service.\nWe attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as employee and third-party nondisclosure and assignment agreements. Our failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe own United States patents and patent applications for some of our products, systems, business methods and technologies. We offer no assurance about the degree of protection which existing or future patents may afford us. Likewise, we offer no assurance that our patent applications will result in issued patents, that our patents will be upheld if challenged, that competitors will not develop similar or superior business methods or products outside the protection of our patents, that competitors will not infringe upon our patents, or that we will have adequate resources to enforce our patents. Effective protection of our United States patents may be unavailable or limited in jurisdictions outside the United States, as the intellectual property laws of foreign countries sometimes offer less protection or have onerous filing requirements. In addition, because some patent applications are maintained in secrecy for a period of time, we could adopt a technology without knowledge of a pending patent application, and such technology could infringe a third party\u2019s patent.\nWe also rely on unpatented proprietary technology. It is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise learn of our unpatented technology. To protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information, we generally require employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements. We cannot assure you that these agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use, misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information. If we are unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nWe rely on our trademarks, trade names, and brand names to distinguish our company and our products and services from our competitors. Some of our trademarks may conflict with trademarks of other companies. Failure to obtain trademark registrations could limit our ability to protect our trademarks and impede our sales and marketing efforts. Further, we cannot assure you that competitors will not infringe our trademarks, or that we will have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks.\nIn addition, third parties may bring infringement and other claims that could be time-consuming and expensive to defend. Also, parties making infringement and other claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to provide our products, services or business methods and could cause us to pay substantial damages. In the event\nof a successful claim of infringement, we may need to obtain one or more licenses from third parties, which may not be available at a reasonable cost, or at all. It is possible that our intellectual property rights may not be valid or that we may infringe upon existing or future proprietary rights of others. Any successful infringement claims could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to seek licenses on unfavorable terms, prevent us from manufacturing or selling products, services and business methods and require us to redesign or, in the case of trademark claims, re-brand our company or products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe are subject to financial and operating covenants in our new credit agreement and any failure to comply with such covenants, or obtain waivers in the event of non-compliance, could result in our being unable to borrow under our new credit agreement and other negative consequences.\nOur new credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association may from time to time require us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. The credit agreement also contains other customary covenants, including certain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, consolidate or merge, enter into acquisitions, guarantee obligations of third parties, make loans or advances, declare or pay any dividend or distribution on our stock, redeem or repurchase shares of our stock, or pledge or dispose of assets.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the financial and other covenants in our new credit agreement. Our failure to comply with these covenants could cause us to be unable to borrow under the credit agreement and may constitute an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of the maturity of any indebtedness then outstanding under the credit agreement, which would require us to pay all amounts then outstanding. Such an event could materially adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity. Additionally, such events of non-compliance could impact the terms of any additional borrowings and/or any credit renewal terms. Any failure to comply with such covenants would be a disclosable event and may be perceived negatively. Such perception could adversely affect the market price for our common stock and our ability to obtain financing in the future.\nIf our information technology systems fail, or if we experience an interruption in their operation, then our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nThe efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information technology systems. We rely on those systems generally to manage the day-to-day operation of our business, manage relationships with our customers, maintain our research and development data and maintain our financial and accounting records. The failure of our information technology systems, our inability to successfully maintain, enhance and/or replace our information technology systems, or any compromise of the integrity or security of the data we generate from our information technology systems, could adversely affect our results of operations, disrupt our business and product development and make us unable, or severely limit our ability, to respond to customer demands. In addition, our information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from:\n\u2022earthquake, fire, flood and other natural disasters;\n\u2022employee or other theft;\n\u2022attacks by computer viruses or hackers;\n\u2022power outages; and\n\u2022computer systems, internet, telecommunications or data network failure.\nAny interruption of our information technology systems could result in decreased revenue, increased expenses, increased capital expenditures, customer dissatisfaction and potential lawsuits, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur retrofitting process frequently involves responsibility for the removal and disposal of components containing hazardous materials.\nWhen we retrofit a customer\u2019s facility, we typically assume responsibility for removing and disposing of its existing lighting fixtures. Certain components of these fixtures typically contain trace amounts of mercury and other hazardous materials. Older components may also contain trace amounts of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs. We currently rely on contractors to remove the components containing such hazardous materials at the customer job site. The contractors then arrange for the disposal of such components at a licensed disposal facility. Failure by such contractors to remove or dispose of the components containing these hazardous materials in a safe, effective and lawful manner could give rise to liability for us, or could expose our workers or other persons to these hazardous materials, which could result in claims against us.\nThe cost of compliance with environmental laws and regulations and any related environmental liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing, among other things, emissions to air, discharge to water, the remediation of contaminated properties and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of, and exposure to, waste and other materials, as well as laws and regulations relating to occupational health and safety. These laws and regulations frequently change, and the violation of these laws or regulations can lead to substantial fines, penalties and other liabilities. The operation of our manufacturing facility entails risks in these areas and there can be no assurance that we will not incur material costs or liabilities in the future which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe expect our quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate. If we fail to meet the expectations of market analysts or investors, the market price of our common stock could decline substantially, and we could become subject to securities litigation.\nOur quarterly revenue and operating results have fluctuated in the past and will likely vary from quarter to quarter in the future. For example, our first fiscal quarter typically reflects operating results that do not compare favorably with our other fiscal quarters. You should not rely upon the results of one quarter as an indication of our future performance. Our revenue and operating results may fall below the expectations of market analysts or investors in some future quarter or quarters. Our failure to meet these expectations could cause the market price of our common stock to decline substantially. If the price of our common stock is volatile or falls significantly below our current price, we may be the target of securities litigation. If we become involved in this type of litigation, regardless of the outcome, we could incur substantial legal costs, management\u2019s attention could be diverted from the operation of our business, and our reputation could be damaged, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur net operating loss carryforwards provide a future benefit only if we are profitable and may be subject to limitation based upon ownership changes.\nAs of March 31, 2015, we had aggregate federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $38.6 million and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $28.9 million. While our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards are fully reserved for, if we are unable to return to and maintain profitability, we may not be able to fully utilize these tax benefits. Furthermore, generally a change of more than 50% in the ownership of a company\u2019s stock, by value, over a three-year period constitutes an ownership change for federal income tax purposes. An ownership change may limit a company\u2019s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards attributable to the period prior to such change. We believe that past issuances and transfers of our stock caused an ownership change in fiscal 2007 that may affect the timing of the use of our net operating loss carryforwards, but we do not believe the ownership change affects the use of the full amount of our net operating loss carryforwards. As a result, our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards attributable to the period prior to such ownership change to offset taxable income will be subject to limitations in a particular year, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability for us. In fiscal 2008, utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards was limited to $3.0 million. For fiscal 2013, 2014, and 2015, utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards was not limited.\nThe failure to establish and maintain internal controls over financial reporting could harm our business and financial results.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that we would prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial statements or fraud. In fiscal 2012, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our internal controls were not effective due to certain identified material weaknesses, which were remediated during fiscal 2013. As of March 31, 2014 and 2015, our internal controls were determined to be effective . However, the failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and in a timely manner or to detect and prevent fraud and could also cause a loss of investor confidence and decline in the market price of our common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not continue to publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will continue to depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If these analysts do not continue to provide adequate research coverage or if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nThe market price of our common stock could be adversely affected by future sales of our common stock in the public market by us or our executive officers and directors.\nWe and executive officers and directors may from time to time sell shares of our common stock in the public market or otherwise. We cannot predict the size or the effect, if any, that future sales of shares of our common stock by us or our executive officers and directors, or the perception of such sales, would have on the market price of our common stock.\nWe are not currently paying dividends and will likely continue not paying dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. In addition, the terms of our existing revolving credit agreement restrict the payment of cash dividends on our common stock. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant.\nAnti-takeover provisions included in the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law, provisions in our amended and restated articles of incorporation or bylaws and the common share purchase rights that accompany shares of our common stock could delay or prevent a change of control of our company, which could adversely impact the value of our common stock and may prevent or frustrate attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current board of directors or management.\nA change of control of our company may be discouraged, delayed or prevented by certain provisions of the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law. These provisions generally restrict a broad range of business combinations between a Wisconsin corporation and a shareholder owning 15% or more of our outstanding common stock. These and other provisions in our amended and restated articles of incorporation, including our staggered board of directors and our ability to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, as well as the provisions of our amended and restated bylaws and Wisconsin law, could make it more difficult for shareholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by the then-current board of directors, including to delay or impede a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving our company.\nEach currently outstanding share of our common stock includes, and each newly issued share of our common stock will include, a common share purchase right. The rights are attached to, and trade with, the shares of common stock and generally are not exercisable. The rights will become exercisable if a person or group acquires, or announces an intention to acquire, 20% or more of our outstanding common stock. The rights have some anti-takeover effects and generally will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire control of us without conditioning the offer on either redemption of the rights or amendment of the rights to prevent this dilution. The rights could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control.\nIn addition, our employment arrangements with senior management provide for severance payments and accelerated vesting of benefits, including accelerated vesting of stock options, upon a change of control. These provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby adversely affecting the market price of our common stock. These provisions may also discourage or prevent a change of control or result in a lower price per share paid to our shareholders.", "PERMNO": 92466, "SIC": 3640, "TIC": "OESX"}
