{"cik": "718877", "company": "Activision Blizzard, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe wish to caution the reader that the following important risk factors, and those risk factors described elsewhere in this report or in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated in forward-looking statements contained in this document and elsewhere. These risks are not presented in order of importance or probability of occurrence. Further, the risks described below are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. Any of these risks may have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows, liquidity or stock price.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits from the King Acquisition.\nOn February 23, 2016, we completed the King Acquisition. The acquisition and integration of the King business exposes us to a number of legal, financial, accounting, tax, managerial, operational and other risks and challenges. Any of these risks or challenges could adversely affect our financial position, profitability and stock price. Such risks and challenges include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022 King could underperform relative to our expectations and the price that we paid for it.\n\u2022 King could cause our financial results to differ from our own or the investment community's expectations in any given period, or over the longer-term.\n\u2022 The tax consequences of the King Acquisition, or the tax treatment of King's operations going forward, could give rise to incremental tax liabilities that are difficult to predict.\n\u2022 Earnings charges relating to the King Acquisition could adversely impact our operating results in any given period, and the impact may be substantially different from period to period.\n\u2022 The integration of King could create demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems that we are unable to effectively handle.\n\u2022 We could experience difficulty in integrating King's personnel, operations and financial and other systems and retaining key employees.\n\u2022 By acquiring King we may have assumed unknown liabilities or internal control deficiencies, and the liabilities that we assumed as a result of the King Acquisition may prove greater than anticipated. The liabilities we assumed include those with respect to King's ongoing legal proceedings, including purported securities class action lawsuits relating to King's initial public offering in March 2014, and those with respect to King's tax liabilities in various jurisdictions. Any of these liabilities or deficiencies may increase our expenses, adversely affect our financial position or cause us to fail to meet our public financial reporting obligations.\n\u2022 As a result of the King Acquisition, we have recorded significant goodwill and other definite lived intangible assets on our balance sheet. If we are not able to realize the value of these assets, we may be required to incur charges relating to the impairment of these assets.\nWe engage in strategic transactions and may encounter difficulties in integrating acquired businesses or otherwise realizing the anticipated benefits of the transactions.\nAs part of our business strategy, from time to time, we acquire, make investments in, or enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures with complementary businesses. These transactions may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including: (A) in the case of an acquisition, (i) the difficulty in integrating the acquired business and operations in an efficient and effective manner, (ii) any liabilities assumed as part of the acquisition, and (iii) the potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses, and, (B) in the case of an investment, alliance or joint venture, (i) our ability to cooperate with our partner, (ii) our partner having economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours, and (iii) the potential that our partner may be unable to meet its economic or other obligations, which would require us to fulfill those obligations alone. If any such transaction involves an entity outside of the United States, it may also subject us to the risks and uncertainties of international trade, including the risk that our operations outside the United States could be conducted by our employees, contractors, third-party partners, representatives or agents in ways that violate anti-bribery laws. Further, any such transaction may involve the risk that our senior management's attention will be excessively diverted from our other operations, the risk that our industry does not evolve as anticipated and that any intellectual property or personnel skills acquired do not prove to be those needed for our future success, and the risk that our strategic objectives, cost savings or other anticipated benefits are otherwise not achieved.\nWe depend on a relatively small number of franchises for a significant portion of our revenues and profits.\nA significant portion of our revenues has historically been derived from products based on a relatively small number of popular franchises and these products are responsible for a disproportionately high percentage of our profits. For example, revenues associated with the Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, Skylanders, and Destiny franchises accounted for approximately 71% of our net revenues, and a significantly higher percentage of our operating income, for 2015. Similarly, King's top two franchises-Candy Crush and Farm Heroes-accounted for a substantial majority of King's revenues in 2015. We expect that a relatively limited number of popular franchises will continue to produce a disproportionately high percentage of our revenues and profits. Due to this dependence on a limited number of franchises, the failure to achieve anticipated results by one or more products based on these franchises could negatively impact our business.\nIf we do not consistently deliver high-quality content, or if consumers prefer competing products, our sales could suffer.\nWhile many new products are regularly introduced in our industry, only a relatively small number of games account for a significant portion of revenues, and an even greater portion of profit. It is difficult to produce high-quality content and to predict, prior to production and distribution, what games will be well-received, even if they are well-reviewed and of high-quality. Competitors often develop content that imitates or competes with our best-selling games, and take sales away from them or reduce our ability to charge the same prices we have historically charged for our products. Products published by our competitors may take a larger share of consumer spending than anticipated, which could cause our product sales to fall below expectations. Consumers may lose interest in a genre of games we produce. If we do not continue to develop consistently high- quality and well-received games, or if our competitors develop more successful products or offer competitive products at lower prices, our revenues, margins and profitability could decline. The increased importance of downloadable content to our business amplifies these risks, as downloadable content for poorly-received games\ntypically generates lower-than-expected sales. In addition, our own best-selling products could compete with our other games, reducing sales for those other games. Further, a failure by us to develop a high-quality product, or our development of a product that is otherwise not well-received, could harm our reputation and increase the likelihood that our future products will not be well-received.\nWe have taken on significant debt, which could adversely affect our business.\nPrior to the Purchase Transaction, the Company maintained extremely low levels of debt. In connection with the Purchase Transaction, we entered into a credit agreement for a $2.5 billion secured term loan facility and a $250 million secured revolving credit facility. The credit agreement was amended in connection with the King Acquisition (as amended from time to time, the \"Credit Agreement\") to, among other things, provide for an incremental $2.3 billion secured term loan facility. In addition, in connection with the Purchase Transaction, we issued, at par, $1.5 billion of 5.625% unsecured senior notes due September 2021 (the \"2021 Notes\") and $750 million of 6.125% unsecured senior notes due September 2023 (the \"2023 Notes\" and, together with the 2021 Notes, the \"Notes\"). As of the date hereof, the Company has approximately $5.9 billion of long-term debt outstanding. The increased debt burden could have important consequences, including: increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund our operations, growth strategy, working capital, capital expenditures, future business opportunities and other general corporate purposes; exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates with respect to any borrowings that are at variable rates of interest; restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures; limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, research and development, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions; and placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors who are less highly leveraged. In addition, a significant portion of our cash and investments are held outside the United States, and we may not be able to service our debt without undergoing the costs of repatriating those funds.\nThe agreements governing our debt contain various covenants that impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to operate our business.\nAgreements governing our indebtedness, including the indenture governing the Notes and the Credit Agreement, impose operating and financial restrictions on our activities. These restrictions require us to comply with or maintain certain financial tests and ratios. In addition, the indenture and credit agreement limit or prohibit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022 incur additional debt and guarantees;\n\u2022 pay distributions or dividends and repurchase stock;\n\u2022 make other restricted payments, including without limitation, certain restricted investments;\n\u2022 create liens;\n\u2022 enter into agreements that restrict dividends from subsidiaries;\n\u2022 engage in transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022 enter into mergers, consolidations or sales of substantially all of our assets.\nIn addition, we are required to maintain a maximum total net debt ratio calculated pursuant to a financial maintenance covenant under the Credit Agreement.\nThese restrictions on our ability to operate our business could seriously harm our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, merger and acquisition and other corporate opportunities.\nFurther, various risks, uncertainties and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with these covenants. Failure to comply with any of the covenants in our financing agreements could result in a default under those agreements and under other agreements containing cross-default provisions. Such a default would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of the debt under these agreements and to foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt. Under these circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations, including our obligations under the indenture governing the Notes or the Credit Agreement. In addition, the limitations imposed by financing agreements on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing. We cannot assure you that we will be granted waivers or amendments to these agreements if for any reason we are unable to comply with these agreements or that we will be able to refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nWe may not be able to borrow funds under our revolving credit facility if we are not able to meet the conditions to borrowing under that facility.\nWe view our revolving credit facility as a source of available liquidity. This facility contains various conditions, covenants and representations with which we must be in compliance in order to borrow funds. We have not borrowed under the revolving credit facility to date, but if we wish to do so, there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance with these conditions, covenants and representations at such time.\nWe may be unable to effectively manage the growth in scope and complexity of our business.\nWe have experienced significant growth in the scope and complexity of our business, including through the development of our Media Networks and Studios businesses. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to manage this expanded business. The growth of our business could create significant challenges for our management, operational, and financial resources, and could increase existing strain on, and divert focus from, our core businesses.\nIn addition, the growth of these new businesses may require significant capital expenditures and allocation of valuable management and employee resources. If not managed effectively, this growth could result in the over-extension of our operating infrastructure, and our management systems, information technology systems, and internal controls and procedures may not be adequate to support this growth. Failure to adequately manage our growth in any of these ways may cause damage to our brand or otherwise negatively impact our business.\nOur financial performance is partly driven by our success in the subscription-based massively multiplayer online role-playing game category, and we may be negatively impacted if consumer preferences trend away from subscription-based games.\nA portion of our revenues is generated by subscription fees paid by consumers who play World of Warcraft. If consumer demand for World of Warcraft declines or if new technologies, play patterns or genres are developed that replace MMORPGs or consumer preferences trend away from subscription-based MMORPGs in favor of free-to-play MMORPGs, it may negatively impact our business.\nSales of titles in certain of our franchises may be affected by the availability of toys and hardware peripherals, increasing our exposure to imbalances between projected and actual demand.\nTitles in our Skylanders franchise involve \"smart toys,\" consisting of action figures and accessories, along with an electronic \"portal,\" which, when used with a figure or accessory, allows a player to store and access information about his or her performance in the game. Similarly, titles in our Guitar Hero\nfranchise use guitar-shaped controllers and other hardware peripherals. We sell the action figures and accessories for Skylanders both bundled with the software for the title and on a stand-alone basis. Consumers may not want to buy the related software if they cannot also buy the \"smart toys\" or accessories. If we underestimate demand or otherwise are unable to produce sufficient quantities of toys or accessories of an acceptable quality or allocate too few toys or accessories to geographic markets where demand exceeds supply, we will forego revenues. This may also create greater opportunities for competitors to develop competitive product offerings. In addition, if we overestimate demand and make too many toys or accessories, or allocate too many toys or accessories to geographic markets where there is insufficient demand, we may incur unrecoverable manufacturing costs for unsold units as well as for unsold game software. Similarly, if we overestimate demand for our Guitar Hero games, we may incur unrecoverable manufacturing costs for unsold games. In any case, unsound hardware manufacturing or allocation decisions may negatively impact our business.\nThe \"smart toys,\" accessories and hardware peripherals related to certain of our franchises, expose us to hardware manufacturing and shipping risks, including availability of sufficient third-party manufacturing capacity and increases in manufacturing and shipping costs.\nThe majority of the manufacturers of the \"smart toys\" involved in our Skylanders franchise and the hardware peripherals used in our Guitar Hero games are third parties located in China. Anything that impacts our ability to import these products or the ability of those manufacturers to produce or otherwise supply us with hardware meeting our quality and safety standards or increases the manufacturers' costs of production may adversely impact our ability to supply that hardware to the market and the prices we must pay for that hardware. Examples of such impacts include: the utilization of any such manufacturer's capacity by another company, changes in safety, environmental or other regulations applicable to the hardware and the manufacturing thereof, natural or manmade disasters that disrupt manufacturing, transportation or communications, labor shortages, civil unrest or issues generally negatively impacting international companies operating in China, increases in the price of petroleum or other raw materials, increases in fuel prices and other shipping costs, and increases in local labor costs in China. Moreover, the failure of those manufacturers to consistently deliver Skylanders action figures or portals and/or Guitar Hero hardware peripherals meeting the quality and safety standards we require could negatively impact our business.\nThe increasing importance of free-to-play games to our business exposes us to the risks of that business model, including the dependence on a relatively small number of consumers for a significant portion of revenues and profits from any game\nAs a result of the King Acquisition, we will be more dependent on our ability to develop, enhance and monetize free-to-play games. These games are available for download to consumers for free, and only generate revenue if consumers use in-game virtual currency to purchase, for example, entertainment time, game boosters, and access to additional content. A relatively small portion of our player network accounts for a large portion of our revenues from our free-to-play games, such as those in our Candy Crush franchise. If we are unable to continue to offer games that encourage these consumers to purchase our virtual currency and subsequently use it to buy our virtual items, if we fail to offer monetization features that appeal to these consumers, if these consumers do not continue to play our games or to purchase virtual items at the same rate, or if we cannot encourage significant additional consumers to purchase virtual items in our games, it could negatively impact our business. Also, if our platform providers make it more difficult or expensive for players to purchase, or we otherwise fail to sell, our virtual currency, our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nTransitions in console platforms could adversely affect the market for interactive entertainment software.\nWhen new console platforms are announced or introduced into the market, consumers typically reduce their purchases of game console entertainment software products for prior console platforms in\nanticipation of purchasing a new platform and products for that platform. During these periods, sales of the game console entertainment software products we publish may decline until new platforms achieve wide consumer acceptance. Platform transitions may have a comparable impact on sales of downloadable content, amplifying the impact on our revenues. This decline may not be offset by increased sales of products for the new console platforms. Conversely, actions we take to curtail the reduction of purchases of products for prior console platforms during the transition may harm sales of products we publish for prior-generation platforms. In addition, as console hardware moves through its life cycle, hardware manufacturers typically enact price reductions and decreasing prices may put downward pressure on software prices. During platform transitions, we may simultaneously incur costs both in continuing to develop and market new titles for prior-generation video game platforms, which may not sell at premium prices, and also in developing products for next -generation platforms, which may not generate immediate or near term revenues. As a result, our business and operating results may be more volatile and difficult to predict during platform transitions than during other times.\nOur business is highly dependent on the success, timely release and availability of new video game platforms and on the continued availability of, and support for, existing video game platforms, as well as our ability to develop commercially successful products for these platforms.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenues from the sale of products for play on video game platforms manufactured by third parties, such as Sony's PS4 and PS3, Microsoft's Xbox One and Xbox 360, and Nintendo's Wii U and Wii. For example, sales of products for consoles accounted for 51% of our consolidated net revenues in 2015. The success of our business is driven in large part by our ability to accurately predict which platforms will be successful in the marketplace, our ability to develop commercially successful products for these platforms, the availability of an adequate supply of these video game platforms and the continued support for these platforms by their manufacturers. We must make product development decisions and commit significant resources well in advance of the anticipated introduction of a new platform.\nWe must make significant expenditures to develop products for new platforms that may not be successful.\nWe must make substantial product development and other investments in a particular platform well in advance of introduction of the platform and may be required to realign our product portfolio and development efforts in response to market changes. Furthermore, development costs for new console platforms are greater than those costs for the then-current console platforms. If increased costs are not offset by higher revenues and other cost efficiencies, our business could be negatively impacted. If the platforms for which we develop new software products or modify existing products do not attain significant market penetration, we may not be able to recover our development costs, which could be significant.\nPlatform licensors frequently control the manufacturing of, and have broad approval rights over, interactive entertainment products.\nGenerally, when we develop interactive entertainment software products for hardware platforms offered by Sony, Microsoft, or Nintendo, the products are manufactured exclusively by that hardware manufacturer or their approved replicator. The agreements with these manufacturers include certain provisions, such as approval rights over all software products and related promotional materials and the ability to change the fee they charge for the manufacturing of products, which allow them substantial influence over the cost and the release schedule of such interactive entertainment software products. In addition, because each of the manufacturers is also a publisher of games for its own hardware platforms and manufactures products for all of its other licensees, a manufacturer may give priority to its own products or those of our competitors in the event of insufficient manufacturing capacity. Accordingly, Sony, Microsoft, or Nintendo could cause unanticipated delays in the release of our products as well as increases to projected development, manufacturing, marketing or distribution costs, any of which could negatively impact our business.\nIn addition, platform licensors control our ability to provide online game capabilities for console platform products and, in large part, establish the financial terms and/or pricing on which these products and services are offered to consumers. Currently, Sony provides online capabilities for the PS4 and PS3, Microsoft provides online capabilities for the Xbox One and Xbox 360, and Nintendo provides online capabilities for the Wii U and Wii. In each case, compatibility code and/or the consent of the licensor are required for us to include online capabilities in its console products. The failure or refusal of licensors to approve our products could negatively impact our business.\nWe must negotiate with platform licensors to agree upon the royalty rates and other fees that must be paid to publish games for their platforms or distribute content on their networks, and therefore they can have significant influence on our costs.\nWe pay a licensing fee to the hardware manufacturer for each copy of a product manufactured for that manufacturer's game platform. The platform license agreements we enter into with those manufacturers specify the fee and/or price that we must pay in order to publish games for that platform. Similarly, the platform licensors control the retail pricing for games and additional content purchased over their networks. The control that platform licensors have over the fee structures and/or pricing for their platforms and online networks could impact the volume of purchases of our products made over their network and our profitability. It is also possible that platform licensors will not renew our existing licenses and/or will decline to distribute our digital content on their networks. Any increase in fee structures and/or pricing, or nonrenewal of licenses, could have a negative impact on our business, particularly for Activision, as the publishing of products for console systems is the largest portion of Activision's business.\nOutside of fee arrangements, our agreement with any manufacturer typically gives it significant control over other aspects of the distribution of our products and services that we develop for that manufacturer's game platform. If the manufacturer establishes terms that restrict our offerings on its platform, or significantly impact the financial terms on which these products or services are offered to our customers, we may be unable to distribute our products or be forced to do so on a materially worse financial or business terms.\nWe rely on third-party platforms to distribute our free-to-play games and collect payments. If we are unable to maintain a good relationship with such platform providers, if their terms and conditions, methods of distribution, payment practices or pricing changed to our detriment, or if we violate, or if a platform provider believes that we have violated, the terms and conditions of its platform, our business may be negatively impacted.\nFollowing the King Acquisition, we expect to derive significant revenues from the distribution of our free-to-play games on third-party platforms such as the Apple App Store, the Google Play Store, and Facebook, and most of the virtual currency we sell is purchased using the payments processing systems of these platform providers. These platforms also serve as significant online distribution platforms for our games. We are subject to their standard terms and conditions for application developers, which govern the promotion, distribution and operation of games and other applications on their platforms. If we violate, or if a platform provider believes that we have violated, its terms and conditions, the particular platform provider may discontinue or limit our access to that platform, which would harm our business. Our business would also be harmed if: their platforms decline in popularity; they modify their current discovery mechanisms, communication channels available to developers, respective terms of service or other policies, including fees; they are required to change how they label free-to-play games or take payment for in-app purchases, or change how the personal information of consumers is made available to developers; or they develop their own competitive offerings.\nIf we do not continue to attract and retain skilled personnel, we will be unable to effectively conduct our business.\nOne of our most essential assets is our employees and, as such, our success depends to a significant extent on our ability to identify, hire, retain and utilize the abilities of qualified personnel, particularly personnel with the specialized skills needed to create and sell the high-quality, well- received content upon which our business is substantially dependent. The software industry is characterized by a high level of employee mobility and aggressive recruiting among competitors for employees with technical, marketing, sales, engineering, product development, creative and/or management skills. We may have difficulties in attracting and retaining skilled personnel or may incur significant costs in order to do so. If we are unable to attract additional qualified employees or retain and utilize the services of key personnel, it could have a negative impact on our business.\nOur reputation with consumers is critical to our success. Negative consumer perceptions about our brands, games, services and/or business practices may damage our business and any costs incurred in addressing consumer concerns may increase our operating expenses.\nIndividual consumers form our ultimate customer base, and consumer expectations regarding the quality, performance and integrity of our products and services are high. Consumers may be critical of our brands, games, services and/or business practices for a wide variety of reasons. These negative consumer reactions may not be foreseeable or within our control to manage effectively. Actions we take to address consumer concerns may be costly and, in any case, may not be successful. In addition, negative consumer sentiment about our business practices may result in inquiries or investigations from regulatory agencies and consumer groups, as well as litigation, which, regardless of their outcome, may be damaging to our reputation. Any of these may have a negative impact on our business.\nWe use open source software in connection with certain of our games and services, which may pose particular risks to our proprietary software, products, and services in a manner that could have a negative impact on our business.\nWe use open source software in connection with certain of our games and the services we offer. Some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software or make available any derivative works of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost. The terms of various open source licenses have not been interpreted by courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our use of the open source software. Were it determined that our use was not in compliance with a particular license, we may be required to release our proprietary source code, pay damages for breach of contract, re-engineer our games, discontinue distribution in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis, or take other remedial action that may divert resources away from our game development efforts, any of which could harm our business.\nIf our games and services do not function as consumers expect, it may have a negative impact on our business.\nIf our games and services do not function as consumers expect, whether because they fail to function as advertised or otherwise, our sales may suffer. The risk that this may occur is particularly pronounced with respect to our games with online features because they involve ongoing consumer expectations, which we may not be able to successfully satisfy. Our games with online features are also frequently updated, increasing the risk that a game may contain significant \"bugs.\" Further, these games are reliant on third-party servers and platform providers, increasing the risk that a particular game may be unavailable when consumers attempt to access it or that navigation through a game may be slower than consumers expect. If any of these issues occur, consumers may stop playing the game\nand may be less likely to return to the game as often in the future. If our games and services do not function as consumers expect, it may negatively impact our business.\nThe future success of our business depends on our ability to release popular products in a timely manner.\nThe life of any given console, handheld or mobile game product is relatively short and generally involves a relatively high level of sales during the first few months after the product's introduction, followed by a rapid decline in sales. Because revenues associated with an initial product launch generally constitute a high percentage of the total revenues associated with the life of a product, delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of one or more new products could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and reputation and could cause our results of operations to be materially different from expectations. It is therefore important for us to continue to develop many high-quality new products that are popularly received and to release those products in a timely manner, as well as to continue to extend the life of existing games by adding features and functionality that will encourage continued engagement with the game. If we are unable to continue to do so, it may negatively impact our business.\nIf we are unable to sustain traditional pricing levels for our products, our business could suffer materially.\nIf we are unable to sustain traditional pricing levels for our console or PC titles or the associated downloadable content, whether due to competitive pressure, because retailers elect to price these products at a lower price or otherwise, it could have a negative impact on our business. Further, we make provisions for retail inventory price protection based upon certain assumed lowest prices and if competitive pressures force us to lower our prices below those levels, it could similarly have a negative impact on our business.\nIf we fail to successfully manage our new product development, or if we fail to anticipate the issues associated with that development, it may negatively impact our business.\nOur business models are evolving and we believe that our growth will depend, in part, upon our ability to successfully develop and sell new types of products, and to otherwise expand the methods by which we reach our consumers, including via digital distribution. Developing new products and distribution channels requires substantial up- front expenditures. Further, forecasting our revenues and profitability for these new business models is inherently uncertain and volatile. If such products or distribution channels do not achieve expected acceptance or generate sufficient revenues upon introduction, whether because of competition or otherwise, we may not recover the cost of our investments in developing and marketing those products and distribution channels, or recover the opportunity cost of diverting management and financial resources away from other products or distribution channels. In addition, expanding our business models will add complexity to our business and require us to effectively adapt our business and management processes to address the unique challenges and different requirements of any new areas in which we operate, which we may not be able to do, for lack of institutional expertise or otherwise.\nOur industry is subject to rapid technological change, and if we do not adapt to, and appropriately allocate our new resources among, emerging technologies and business models, our business may be negatively impacted.\nTechnology changes rapidly in the interactive entertainment industry. We must continually anticipate and adapt our products to emerging technologies, delivery platforms and business models in order to stay competitive. When we choose to incorporate a new technology into a product or to develop a product for a new platform, operating system or media format, we often are required to make a substantial investment prior to the introduction of the product. If we invest in the development of interactive entertainment products incorporating a new technology or for a new platform that does\nnot achieve significant commercial success, our revenues from those products likely will be lower than we anticipated and may not cover our development costs. Further, our competitors may adapt to an emerging technology or business model more quickly or effectively than we do, creating products that are technologically superior to ours, more appealing to consumers, or both. If, on the other hand, we elect not to pursue the development of products incorporating a new technology or for new platforms, or otherwise elect not to pursue a new business model, that achieves significant commercial success, it may have adverse consequences. It may take significant time and resources to shift product development resources to that technology, platform or business model, as the case may be, and may be more difficult to compete against existing products incorporating that technology or for that platform or against companies using that business model. For example, digital content delivery is increasingly important in our industry, requiring us to develop or acquire the expertise in such delivery method needed to remain competitive. Any failure to successfully adapt to, and appropriately allocate resources among, emerging technologies could negatively impact our business.\nThe increasing importance of digital sales to our business exposes us to the risks of that business model, including greater competition.\nThe proportion of our revenues derived from digital content delivery, as compared to traditional retail sales, continues to increase. The increased importance of digital content delivery in our industry increases our potential competition, as the minimum capital needed to produce and publish a digitally delivered game, particularly a new game for mobile platforms, may be significantly less than that needed to produce and publish one that is purchased through retail distribution and is played on a game console. Shifting to digital delivery of our products also requires us to dedicate capital to developing and implementing alternative marketing strategies, which we may not do successfully. If any of this occurs, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, a continuing shift to digital delivery could result in a deprioritization of our products by traditional retailers and distributors, giving rise to the same material adverse effects.\nThe increasing prevalence of free-to-play games exposes us to risks from that business model.\nWe expect that the portion of the total revenues of the interactive entertainment industry, and of our revenues, generated by free-to-play entertainment products, which are monetized through in-game microtransactions rather than an up-front fee, will continue to increase, including as a result of the King Acquisition. We may invest in the development of free-to-play interactive entertainment products that do not achieve significant commercial success, in which case our revenues from those products likely will be lower than anticipated and we may not recover our development costs. Even if our free-to-play games are initially well-received, we may not be able to generate or sustain consumer engagement sufficient to generate significant revenues, if any, through in-game microtransactions. In addition, a continuing shift to free-to-play games could result in a deprioritization of our products by traditional retailers and distributors. Furthermore, as there are relatively low barriers to entry to developing free-to-play games, we expect new competitors to enter the market and existing competitors to allocate more resources to develop and market competing games.\nIf we are unable to successfully develop or market owned intellectual property, we may publish fewer successful games and our revenues may decline.\nSome of our products are based on intellectual property that we have developed internally or acquired from third parties. Consumers have historically preferred content which is part of an established franchise to content based on new intellectual property. If a new intellectual property does not gain consumer acceptance, whether because we are unable to successfully create consumer appeal and brand recognition or for other reasons, our business could be negatively impacted. Further, if the popularity of our owned intellectual property declines, we may have to write off the unrecovered\nportion of the underlying intellectual property assets, and revenues and operating income from these intellectual properties may decline quickly, either of which could negatively impact our business.\nCompetition within, and to, the interactive entertainment industry is intense, and competitors may succeed in reducing our sales.\nWithin the interactive entertainment industry, we compete with other publishers of interactive entertainment software, both within the United States and, increasingly, in international jurisdictions. Our competitors include very large corporations with significantly greater financial, marketing and product development resources than we have. For example, integrated video game console hardware and software companies such as Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo, compete directly with us in the development of content for their respective platforms. A relatively small number of franchises account for a significant portion of revenues, and an even greater portion of profit, in the interactive entertainment industry, and the availability of significant financial resources is a major competitive factor in the production of high-quality products and in the marketing of products that are ultimately well-received. Our larger competitors may be able to leverage their greater financial, technical, personnel and other resources to finance larger budgets for development and marketing and make higher offers to licensors and developers for commercially desirable properties as well as adopt more aggressive pricing policies to develop more commercially successful video game products than we do. In addition, competitors with large product lines and popular games typically have greater leverage with retailers, distributors and other customers, who may be willing to promote products with less consumer appeal in return for access to those competitors' more popular games.\nIncreased consumer acceptance and availability of interactive entertainment developed for use by consumers on handheld, mobile and tablet devices or social networking sites or other online games, consumer acceptance and availability of technology which allows users to play games on televisions without consoles, or technological advances in online game software or the Internet could result in a decline in sales of our platform-based software.\nFurthermore, as there are relatively low barriers to entry to developing mobile or online free-to-play or other casual games, we expect new competitors to enter the market and existing competitors to allocate more resources to develop and market competing games and applications. We compete, or will compete, with a vast number of small companies and individuals who are able to create and launch casual games and other content using relatively limited resources and with relatively limited start-up time or expertise. Competition for the attention of consumers on mobile devices is intense, as the number of applications on mobile devices has been increasing dramatically. This increased competition could negatively impact our business.\nAdditionally, we compete with other forms of entertainment and leisure activities. For example, the overall growth in the use of the Internet and online services such as social networking sites by consumers may pose a competitive threat if consumers and potential consumers spend less of their available time using interactive entertainment software and more of their available time using the Internet, including those online services. Further, it is difficult to predict and prepare for rapid changes in consumer demand that could materially alter public preferences for different forms of entertainment and leisure activities. Failure to adequately identify and adapt to the competitive pressures described herein could negatively impact our business.\nThe development of high-quality products requires substantial up-front expenditures, and we may not be able to recover those costs for our future products.\nConsumer preferences for games are usually cyclical and difficult to predict, and even the most successful content remains popular for only limited periods of time, unless refreshed with new content or otherwise enhanced. In order to remain competitive, we must continuously develop new products or\nenhancements to existing products. The amount of lead time and cost involved in the development of high-quality products is increasing, and the longer the lead time involved in developing a product and the greater the allocation of financial resources to such product, the more critical it is that we accurately predict consumer demand for such product. If our future products do not achieve expected consumer acceptance or generate sufficient revenues upon introduction, we may not be able to recover the substantial development and marketing costs associated with those products.\nWe may overestimate demand for a product, incurring unrecoverable manufacturing costs.\nWe pay a licensing fee to the console hardware manufacturer for each physical copy of a product manufactured for that manufacturer's game platform, regardless of whether that product is sold. If we overestimate demand and make too many physical \"boxed\" copies of any title, we will incur unrecoverable manufacturing costs for unsold units.\nWe are exposed to seasonality in the sale of our products.\nThe interactive entertainment industry is highly seasonal, with the highest levels of consumer demand occurring during the year-end holiday buying season in the fourth quarter of the year. As a result, our sales have historically been highest during the second half of the year, particularly for our Activision segment. Receivables and credit risk are likewise higher during the second half of the year, as retailers increase their purchases of our products in anticipation of the holiday season. Delays in development, licensor approvals or manufacturing can affect the timing of the release of products, causing us to miss key selling periods such as the year-end holiday buying season.\nIf our proprietary online gaming service, Battle.net, does not function properly, our business may be negatively impacted.\nIf Blizzard's proprietary online gaming service, Battle.net, does not function as anticipated, Blizzard's games may be completely unavailable or Blizzard may be prevented from delivering content digitally, which could result in a loss of sales for Blizzard's games. Further, any disruption in Battle.net's services could negatively impact our business.\nWe depend on servers to operate our games with online features, as well as Battle.net, our digital service with online features. If we were to lose server functionality, for any reason, our business may be negatively impacted.\nOur business relies on the continuous operation of servers which are owned and operated by third parties. Although we strive to maintain more than sufficient server capacity, and provide for active redundancy in the event of limited hardware failure, any broad-based catastrophic server malfunction, a significant service-disrupting attack or intrusion by hackers that circumvents security measures, a failure of disaster recovery service or the failure of a company on which we are relying for server capacity to provide that capacity for whatever reason would likely interrupt the availability or operation of Blizzard's games, and/or degrade or interrupt the functionality of other games of ours with online features, and could result in the loss of sales for, or in, such games (including subscription-based sales for World of Warcraft). This risk is particularly pronounced with respect to the mobile games published by King, which rely on a small number of third-party owned data centers located in Stockholm, Sweden. An extended interruption of service could negatively impact our business.\nWe must project our future server needs and make advance purchases of servers or server capacity to accommodate expected business demands. If we underestimate the amount of server capacity our business requires or if our business were to grow more quickly than expected, our consumers may experience service problems, such as slow or interrupted gaming access. Insufficient server capacity\ncould negatively impact our business. Conversely, if we overestimate the amount of server capacity required by our business, we may incur additional operating costs.\nIf any of the networks operated by third parties on which we sell digital content for our console games or the online third-party platforms on which we distribute our free-to-play games are unavailable for a prolonged period of time, our business could be negatively impacted.\nWe rely on the networks operated by third parties, such as the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live, for the sale and digital delivery of downloadable console-game content. Similarly, we rely on the continued operation of the Apple App Store, the Google Play Store, and Facebook for the sale of virtual currency for our free-to-play games. In the event the efficient operation and functionality of these third-party networks or platforms is interrupted for a prolonged period of time, it could have a negative impact on our business.\nWe may not accurately predict the amount of Internet bandwidth or computational resources necessary to sustain our online gaming businesses.\nOur business is dependent on the availability of sufficient Internet bandwidth and computational resources. If the price of either such resource increases, we may not be able to increase our prices or subscriber levels to compensate for such costs. Because of the importance of our online business to our revenues and results of operations, our ability to access adequate bandwidth and online computational resources to support our business is critical.\nTo secure access to such resources, we have entered into arrangements with several providers to secure future capacity, some of which involve long-term contracts. If the price of such resources were to decrease, our contractual commitments to pay higher prices could affect our ability to compete with other publishers of interactive software products paying lower prices. Further, because we purchase additional capacity based on anticipated growth, our capacity is sometimes larger than necessary to sustain our existing needs. If our projected online business growth is delayed or does not occur, we will incur larger expenses for such resources than necessary. Conversely, if we underestimate the amount of bandwidth that our online business requires, and our purchased capacity is insufficient to meet demand, our business may be negatively impacted.\nWe may be involved in legal proceedings that may result in material adverse outcomes.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in claims, suits, government investigations, audits and proceedings arising from the ordinary course of our business, including actions with respect to intellectual property, competition and antitrust matters, privacy matters, tax matters, labor and employment matters, unclaimed property matters, compliance and commercial claims. Such claims, suits, government investigations, audits and proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of the outcome, such legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. In addition, it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in substantial settlements, judgments, fines or penalties, criminal sanctions, consent decrees or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products or services, requiring us to change our development process or other business practices.\nWe may be subject to intellectual property claims.\nAs the number of interactive entertainment software products increases and the features and content of these products continue to overlap, software developers have increasingly become subject to infringement claims. Further, many of our products are highly realistic and feature materials that are based on real world things or people, which may also be the subject of intellectual property\ninfringement claims of others, including right of publicity claims. In addition, our products often utilize complex, cutting-edge technology that may become subject to emerging intellectual property rights of others. Although we take steps to avoid knowingly violating the intellectual property rights of others, it is possible that third parties still may claim infringement, particularly since there are an increasing number of companies that focus their efforts exclusively on enforcing their patent rights.\nFrom time to time, we receive communications from third parties regarding such claims. Existing or future infringement claims against us, whether valid or not, may be time consuming, distracting to management and expensive to defend. Further, intellectual property litigation or claims could force us to do one or more of the following:\n\u2022 cease selling, incorporating, supporting or using products or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;\n\u2022 obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property, which if available at all, may not be available on commercially favorable terms;\n\u2022 redesign the affected interactive entertainment software products, which could result in additional costs, delay introduction and possibly reduce commercial appeal of the affected products; or\n\u2022 pay damages to the holder of the infringed intellectual property for past infringements.\nIssues with the toys, accessories or hardware peripherals utilized in certain of our games may lead to product liability, personal injury or property damage claims, recalls, replacements of products, or regulatory actions by governmental authorities.\nWe may experience issues with Skylanders toys and accessories or Guitar Hero hardware peripherals that may lead to product liability, personal injury or property damage claims, recalls, replacements of products, or regulatory actions by governmental authorities. Any of these activities could result in increased governmental scrutiny, harm to our reputation, reduced demand by consumers for our products, decreased willingness by our customers to purchase or by our partners to provide marketing support for those products, denial or increased cost for insurance coverage, or additional safety and testing requirements. Such results could divert development and management resources and increase legal fees and other costs, and otherwise could negatively impact our business.\nOur products may be subject to legal claims.\nIn prior years, lawsuits have been filed against numerous interactive entertainment companies, including against Activision Blizzard, by the families of victims of violence, alleging that interactive entertainment products influence the behavior of the perpetrators of such violence. These lawsuits have been dismissed, but similar additional lawsuits may be filed in the future. Although our general liability insurance carrier has agreed to defend lawsuits of this nature with respect to the prior lawsuits, it is uncertain whether insurance carriers would do so in the future, or if such insurance carriers would cover all or any amounts for which we might be liable if such future lawsuits are not decided in our favor. Further, any such lawsuit could result in increased governmental scrutiny, harm to our reputation, reduced demand by consumers for our products, or decreased willingness by our customers to purchase or by our partners to provide marketing support for those products. Such results could divert development and management resources, increase legal fees and other costs and have other negative impacts on our business.\nOur products are subject to the threat of piracy and unauthorized copying, and inadequate intellectual property laws and other protections could prevent us from enforcing or defending our proprietary technologies. We may also face legal risks arising out of user-generated content. Further, cheating, through use of unauthorized \"cheating\" programs and other unauthorized software modifications by users, could lead to reductions in microtransactions in our games.\nWe regard our software as proprietary and rely on a variety of methods, including a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws and employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, to protect our proprietary rights. We own or license various copyrights, patents, trademarks and trade secrets. The process of registering and protecting these rights in various jurisdictions is expensive and time-consuming. Further, we are aware that some unauthorized copying occurs, and if a significantly greater amount of unauthorized copying of our software products were to occur, it could negatively impact our business.\nPolicing unauthorized sale, distribution and use of our products is difficult, expensive, and time-consuming, and software piracy (including online piracy) is a persistent problem for us. Further, the laws of some countries in which our products are or may be distributed either do not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, or are poorly enforced. Legal protection of our rights may be ineffective in such countries. In addition, though we take steps to make the unauthorized sale, distribution and use of our products more difficult and to otherwise enforce and police our rights, as do the manufacturers of consoles and the operators of other platforms on which many of our games are played, our efforts and the efforts of the console manufacturers and platform operators may not be successful in controlling the piracy of our products in all instances. Technology designed to circumvent the protection measures used in our products, the availability of broadband access to the Internet, the refusal of Internet service providers to remove infringing content in certain instances, the ability to download pirated copies of games from various Internet sites and peer-to-peer networks, and Internet cafes using pirated copies of our products all have contributed to an expansion in piracy.\nIn addition, unrelated third parties have developed, and may continue to develop, \"cheating\" programs or other unauthorized software tools and modifications that enable consumers to cheat in games, such as those in our Candy Crush franchise, which could negatively impact the volume of microtransactions or purchases of downloadable content. In addition, vulnerabilities in the design of our applications and of the platforms upon which they run could be discovered after their release, which may result in lost revenue opportunities. This may lead to lost revenues from paying consumers or increased cost of developing technological measures to respond to these, either of which could negatively impact our business.\nWe also cannot be certain that existing intellectual property laws will provide adequate protection for our products in connection with emerging technologies.\nWe rely on external developers to develop some of our software products.\nWe rely on external software developers to develop some of our software products. Because we depend on these developers, we are subject to the following risks:\n\u2022 continuing strong demand for top-tier developers' resources, combined with the recognition they receive in connection with their work, may cause developers who worked for us in the past either to work for a competitor in the future or to renegotiate agreements with us on terms less favorable to us;\n\u2022 limited financial resources and business expertise and inability to retain skilled personnel may force developers out of business prior to completing products or require us to fund additional costs;\n\u2022 a competitor may acquire the businesses of key developers or sign them to exclusive development arrangements and, in either case, we would not be able to continue to engage such developers' services for our products, except for any period of time for which those developers are contractually obligated to complete development for us; and\n\u2022 reliance on external developers reduces our visibility into, and control over, development schedules and operational outcomes compared to those when utilizing internal development resources.\nIncreased competition for skilled third-party software developers also has compelled us to agree to make significant advance payments on royalties to game developers. If the products subject to these arrangements do not generate sufficient revenues to recover these royalty advances, we would have to write-off unrecovered portions of these payments, which could negatively impact our business. Typically, we pay developers a royalty based on a percentage of net revenues from product sales, less agreed upon deductions, but from time to time, we have agreed to pay developers fixed per unit product royalties after royalty advances are fully recouped. To the extent that sales prices of products on which we have agreed to pay a fixed per unit royalty are marked down, it could negatively impact our business.\nOur sales may decline substantially without warning and in a brief period of time because a substantial portion of our sales are made to a relatively small number of key customers and because we do not have long-term contracts for the sale of our products.\nIn the United States and Canada, our \"boxed\" products are often sold on a direct basis to mass-market retailers, consumer electronics stores, discount warehouses and game specialty stores. Our \"boxed\" products are sold internationally on a direct-to-retail basis, through third-party distribution and licensing arrangements, and through our wholly-owned European distribution subsidiaries. Our sales are made primarily on a purchase order basis without long-term agreements or other forms of commitments, and our retail customers and distributors have generally been reducing the levels of inventory they are willing to carry. The loss of, or significant reduction in sales to, any of Activision's principal retail customers or distributors could have adverse consequences. The concentration of sales in a small number of large customers also makes us more vulnerable to collection risk if one or more of these large customers becomes unable to pay for our products or seeks protection under the bankruptcy laws. In addition, having such a large portion of our total net revenues concentrated in a few customers reduces our negotiating leverage with these customers.\nOur business may be harmed if our distributors, retailers, development and licensing partners, or other parties with whom we do business become unable to honor their existing financial obligations to us or seek protection under the bankruptcy laws.\nSome of our business partners are highly-leveraged or small businesses that may be particularly vulnerable to difficult economic conditions. As a result of current economic conditions in some parts of the world, we are subject to heightened counterparty risks, including the risks that our business partners may default on their obligations to us or seek protection under the bankruptcy laws.\nFor example, retailers and distributors in the interactive entertainment industry have from time to time experienced significant fluctuations in their businesses and a number of them have failed. We typically make sales to most retailers and some distributors on unsecured credit, with terms that vary depending upon the customer's credit history, solvency, credit limits and sales history, as well as prevailing terms with similarly situated customers and whether sufficient credit insurance can be obtained. Challenging economic conditions may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products they have purchased, and as a result, our reserves for doubtful accounts and write-off of accounts receivable could increase and, even if increased, may turn out to be insufficient. Moreover, even in\ncases where we have insolvency risk insurance to protect against a customer's bankruptcy, insolvency or liquidation, this insurance typically contains a significant deductible and co-payment obligation, and does not cover all instances of non-payment. Further, the insolvency or business failure of other types of business partners could result in disruptions to the manufacturing or distribution of our products or the cancellation of contractual arrangements that we consider to be favorable. A payment default by, or the insolvency or business failure of, a significant business partner could negatively impact our business.\nOur business may be harmed if our distributors, retailers, development and licensing partners, or other parties with whom we do business act in ways that place our brand at risk.\nThe actions of our business partners may put our business and our reputation at risk. In many cases, these third parties are given access to sensitive and proprietary information in order to provide services and support our team. These third parties may misappropriate our information and engage in unauthorized use of it. The failure of these third parties to provide adequate services and technologies, or the failure of third parties to adequately maintain or update their services and technologies, could result in a disruption to our business operations, and may negatively impact our business.\nOur business is subject to the risks and uncertainties of international trade.\nWe conduct business throughout the world, and we derive a substantial amount of revenues and profits from international trade, particularly from Europe, Asia and Australia. We expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues and profits in the future and, moreover, that sales in emerging markets in Asia and elsewhere will be an increasingly important part of our international sales.\nAs such, we are, and may be increasingly, subject to risks inherent in foreign trade generally, as well as risks inherent in doing business in emerging markets, including increased tariffs and duties, compliance with economic sanctions, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, shipping delays, increases in transportation costs, international political, regulatory and economic developments, unexpected changes to laws, regulatory requirements and enforcement on us and our platform partners and differing local business practices, all of which may impact operating margins or make it more difficult, if not impossible, for us to conduct business in foreign markets.\nA deterioration in relations between either us or the United States and any country in which we have significant operations or sales, or the implementation of government regulations in such a country, including China in particular, could result in the adoption or expansion of trade restrictions, including economic sanctions, that could have a material adverse effect on our business. For instance, to operate in China, all games must have regulatory approval. A decision by the Chinese government to revoke its approval for any of our games or to decline to approve any products we desire to sell in China in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, in the past, legislation has been implemented in China that has required modifications to our software. The future implementation of similar laws or regulations in China or any other country in which we have operations or sales may restrict or prohibit the sale of our products or may require engineering modifications to our products that are not cost-effective, if even feasible at all, or could degrade the consumer experience to the point where consumers cease to purchase such products. Further, the enforcement of regulation of mobile and other games with an online element in China remains uncertain, and further changes, either in the regulations or their enforcement, could have a material impact on our business in China.\nWe are also subject to risks that our operations outside the United States could be conducted by our employees, contractors, third-party partners, representatives or agents in ways that violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act or other similar anti-bribery laws. While we have policies and procedures, as well as training for our employees, intended to secure compliance with these laws, our employees, contractors, third-party partners, representatives or agents may take actions\nthat violate our policies. Moreover, it may be more difficult to oversee the conduct of any such persons who are not our employees, potentially exposing us to greater risk from their actions.\nIn addition, cultural differences may affect consumer preferences and limit the international popularity of games that are popular in the U.S, or require us to modify the content of the games or the method by which we charge our customers for the games in order to be successful. If we do not correctly assess consumer preferences in the countries in which we sell our products, or if the other risks discussed herein come to fruition, it could negatively impact our business.\nChanges in tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and in various other jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes, and in the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are required to estimate future taxes. Although we currently believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the estimation process is inherently uncertain, and such estimates are not binding on tax authorities. Further, our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by a variety of factors, including changes in our business, including the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax elections, and changes in applicable tax laws. Additionally, tax determinations are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities and developments in those audits could adversely affect our income tax provision. Should the ultimate tax liability exceed estimates, our income tax provision and net income could be materially adversely affected.\nWe earn a significant amount of our operating income, and hold a significant portion of our cash and investments, outside the United States. While our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the United States, any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions would likely result in higher effective tax rates for the Company. In addition, there have been proposals to change U.S. tax laws that would significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings. Although we cannot predict whether, or in what form, this proposed legislation will pass, if enacted it could negatively impact our business.\nWe are also required to pay taxes other than income taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property, and goods and services taxes, in both the United States and various other jurisdictions. Tax authorities regularly examine these non-income taxes. The outcomes from these examinations, changes in the business, changes in applicable tax rules or other tax matters may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe transact business in various currencies other than the U.S. dollar and have significant international sales and expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, subjecting us to currency exchange rate risks. A substantial portion of our international sales and expenses are denominated in local currencies, including the euro, British pound, Australian dollar, Chinese renminbi, Swedish krona and Korean won, which could fluctuate against the U.S. dollar. Since we have significant international sales, but incur the majority of our costs in the United States, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may have an asymmetric and disproportional impact on our business. We have, in the past, utilized currency derivative contracts to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures, with hedge maturities of generally less than 12 months, and managed these exposures with natural offsets. However, there can be no assurance that we will continue our hedging programs, or that we will be successful in managing exposure to currency exchange rate risks whether or not we do so.\nOur reported financial results could be adversely affected by changes in financial accounting standards or by the application of existing or future accounting standards to our business as it evolves.\nOur reported financial results are impacted by the accounting policies promulgated by the SEC and national accounting standards bodies and the methods, estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies. Policies affecting revenue recognition have and could further significantly affect the way we report revenues related to our products and services. We recognize a majority of the revenues from bundled sales (i.e., packaged goods video games that include an online service component) on a deferred basis over an estimated service period for such games. In addition, we defer the costs of sales of those products. We expect that an increasing number of our games will be online-enabled in the future and that we could be required to recognize the related revenues over a period of time rather than at the time of sale. Further, as we increase our downloadable content and add new features to our online services, our estimate of the service period may change and we could be required to recognize revenues, and defer related costs, over a shorter or longer period of time. As we enhance, expand and diversify our business and product offerings, the application of existing or future financial accounting standards, particularly those relating to the way we account for revenues and taxes, could have an adverse effect on our reported net revenues, net income and earnings per share under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States in any given period.\nCertain of our key operating metrics are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.\nWe track certain key operating metrics using internal tools, which have certain limitations. In addition, we rely on data received from third parties, including third-party platforms, to track certain performance indicators. We only have a limited ability to verify data from both of these sources.\nOur methodologies for tracking metrics may also change over time, which could result in changes to the metrics we report. If we undercount or overcount performance due to the internal tools we use or issues with the data received from third parties, or if our internal tools contain errors, the data we report may not be accurate or comparable with prior periods. In addition, limitations, changes or errors with respect to how we measure data may affect our understanding of certain details of our business, which could affect our longer term strategies. If our performance metrics are not accurate representations of our financial or operational performance, if we discover material inaccuracies in our metrics, or if we can no longer calculate any of our key performance metrics with a sufficient degree of accuracy and cannot find an adequate replacement for the metric, our business could be negatively impacted.\nWe may permit our customers to return products and to receive pricing concessions which could negatively impact our business.\nWe are exposed to the risk of product returns and price protection with respect to our distributors and retailers. In some cases, return policies allow distributors and retailers to return defective, shelf-worn, damaged and certain other products in accordance with terms granted. Price protection, when granted and applicable, allows these distributors and retailers a credit against amounts owed with respect to merchandise unsold by them. We may permit product returns from, or grant price protection to, our customers under certain conditions. These conditions may include compliance with applicable payment terms, delivery of weekly inventory and sales information and consistent participation in the launches of premium title releases. We may also consider other factors, including the facilitation of slow-moving inventory and other industry factors. When we offer price protection, it may be offered with respect to a particular product to all of our distributors and retailer customers who meet the applicable conditions. Activision also offers a 90-day limited warranty to its consumer end users that Activision products will be free from manufacturing defects. Although we maintain a reserve for returns and price protection, and although we may place limits on product returns and price protection, we\ncould be forced to accept substantial product returns and provide substantial price protection to maintain our relationships with retailers and our access to distribution channels. We face similar issues and risks, including exposure to risk of chargebacks, with respect to consumer end users to whom we sell products directly, whether through Battle.net or otherwise.\nWe may face difficulty obtaining access to the retail shelf space necessary to market and sell our products effectively.\nRetailers typically have a limited amount of shelf space and promotional resources, and there is intense competition among consumer interactive entertainment software products for high-quality retail shelf space and promotional support from retailers. To the extent that the number of products and platforms increase, competition for shelf space may intensify and may require us to increase our marketing expenditures. Those issues are exacerbated to the extent any of our products involve physical goods in addition to software and, as such, require additional shelf space, like the titles in our Skylanders franchise, which include both action figures and accessories, as well as an electronic \"portal\", and the title in our Guitar Hero franchise, which includes a \"life sized\" guitar-shaped controller. Retailers with limited shelf space typically devote the most and highest quality shelf space to those products expected to be best sellers. We cannot be certain that our new products will consistently achieve such \"best seller\" status. Due to increased competition for limited shelf space, retailers and distributors are in an increasingly better position to negotiate favorable terms of sale, including price discounts, price protection, marketing and display fees and product return policies. Our products constitute a relatively small percentage of most retailers' sales volume. We cannot be certain that retailers will continue to purchase our products or provide those products with adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support on acceptable terms.\nIf our marketing and advertising efforts fail to resonate with our consumers, our business could be negatively impacted.\nOur products are marketed worldwide through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs. Our ability to sell our products and services is dependent in part upon the success of these programs. If the marketing for our products and services fails to resonate with our consumers, particularly during the critical holiday season or during other key selling periods, or advertising rates or other media placement costs increase, or if the use of cost-effective cross-promotion within our mobile games to retain consumers becomes less effective, these factors could have a negative impact on our business.\nIncreased sales of used interactive entertainment products could lower our sales.\nCertain of our larger customers sell used interactive entertainment products, which are generally priced lower than new interactive entertainment products and do not result in any revenues to the publisher of the games. Sales of used interactive entertainment products could negatively affect our sales of new products.\nOur games are subject to ratings, including the rating systems of the Entertainment Software Rating Board in the U.S. and similar agencies in international jurisdictions. Our failure to obtain our target ratings for our products could negatively impact our business.\nThe Entertainment Software Rating Board (the \"ESRB\") is a self-regulatory body based in the United States that provides consumers of interactive entertainment software with ratings information, including information on the content in such software, such as violence, nudity or sexual content contained in software products. The ESRB rating categories are \"Early Childhood\" (i.e., content is intended for young children), \"Everyone\" (i.e., content is generally suitable for all ages), \"Everyone 10+\" (i.e., content is generally suitable for ages 10 and up), \"Teen\" (i.e., content is generally\nsuitable for ages 13 and up), \"Mature\" (i.e., content is generally suitable for ages 17 and up) and \"Adults Only\" (i.e., content is suitable for adults ages 18 and up). Our console and PC games are subject to ratings by the ESRB and some of our most significant titles have received a \"Mature\" rating, inherently limiting the target audience. Certain countries other than the United States have also established content rating systems as prerequisites for product sales in those countries. Certain stores use other ratings systems, such as Apple's App Rating System and Google Play's use of the International Age Rating Coalition (IARC) rating system. In some instances, a company may be required to modify its products to comply with the requirements of the rating systems, which could delay or disrupt the release of any given product, or may prevent its sale altogether in certain territories. Further, if an agency re-rates one of our games for any reason, retailers could refuse to sell it and demand that we accept the return of any unsold or returned copies or consumers could demand a refund for copies purchased. If we are unable to obtain the ratings we have targeted for our products, it could have a negative impact on our business.\nAdditional content-related policies adopted by retailers could negatively affect sales of our products.\nRetailers may decline to sell interactive entertainment software containing what they judge to be graphic violence or sexually explicit material or other content that they deem inappropriate for their businesses, whether because a product received a certain rating by the ESRB or other content rating system, or otherwise. If retailers decline to sell our products based upon their opinion that they contain objectionable themes, graphic violence or sexually explicit material or other generally objectionable content, we might be required to modify particular titles or forfeit the revenue opportunity of selling such titles with that retailer.\nOur business, products, and distribution are subject to increasing regulation in key territories. If we do not successfully respond to these regulations, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nLegislation is continually being introduced, and litigation and regulatory enforcement actions are taking place, that may affect the way in which we, and other industry participants, may offer content and features, and distribute and advertise our products. Many foreign countries, such as China and Germany, have laws that permit governmental entities to restrict or prohibit marketing or distribution of interactive entertainment software products because of the content therein (and similar legislation has been introduced at one time or another at the federal and state levels in the United States). Further, the growth and development of electronic commerce and virtual items and currency may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on or limitations on operations of companies such as ours conducting business through the Internet and mobile devices. We are also subject to laws and regulations related to protection of minors, consumer privacy, advertising, taxation, payments, intellectual property, distribution, and antitrust, among others. Furthermore, existing laws or new laws regarding the marketing of in-app purchases, regulation of currency, banking institutions, unclaimed property, and money laundering may be interpreted to cover virtual currency or goods. The adoption and enforcement of legislation which restricts the marketing, content, business model, or sales of our products in countries in which we do business may harm the sales of our products, as the products we are able to offer to our customers and the size of the potential market for our products may be limited. We may be required to modify certain product development processes or products or alter our marketing strategies to comply with such regulations, which could be costly or delay the release of our products. The laws and regulations affecting our products vary by territory and may be inconsistent with one another, imposing conflicting or uncertain restrictions. Failure to comply with any applicable legislation may also result in government-imposed fines or other penalties, as well as harm to our reputation. Moreover, the public dialogue concerning interactive entertainment may have an adverse impact on our reputation and consumers' willingness to purchase our products. The King Acquisition has significantly increased our user population, and may\nsubject us to laws and regulations in additional jurisdictions and exacerbate the potential adverse impact on our business.\nAlthough we have structured and operate our skill tournaments with applicable laws in mind, including any applicable laws relating to gambling, and believe that playing these games does not constitute gambling, our skill tournaments could in the future become subject to gambling-related rules and regulations and expose us to civil and criminal penalties. We also sometimes offer consumers of our online and casual games various types of contests and promotional opportunities. We are subject to laws in a number of jurisdictions concerning the operation and offering of such activities and games, many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. If these were to occur, we might be required to seek licenses, authorizations, or approvals from relevant regulators, the granting of which may be dependent on us meeting certain capital and other requirements, and we may be subject to additional regulation and oversight, such as reporting to regulators, all of which could significantly increase our operating costs. Changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the United States, Europe, or elsewhere regarding these activities may lessen the growth of casual game services and impair our business.\nThe laws and regulations concerning data privacy are continually evolving. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business.\nConsumers can play certain of our games online using third-party platforms and networks and on mobile devices. We collect and store significant amounts of information about our consumers of these games-both personally identifying and non-personally identifying information. We are subject to laws from a variety of jurisdictions regarding privacy and the protection of this information. For example, the European Union (the \"E.U.\") has traditionally taken a broader view than the United States and certain other jurisdictions as to what is considered personal information and has imposed greater obligations under data privacy regulations. The U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (\"COPPA\") also regulates the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information from children under 13 years of age. Failure to comply with COPPA may increase our costs, subject us to expensive and distracting government investigations, and result in substantial fines.\nData privacy protection laws are rapidly changing and likely will continue to do so for the foreseeable future, which could impact our approach to operating and marketing our games. For example, the Court of Justice of the European Union's recent decision to invalidate the E.U.-U.S. Safe Harbor regime that legitimized the transfer of personal data from the E.U. to the U.S. was a material change to laws on data privacy applicable to our business. The European Commission and the U.S. government have recently agreed to a new framework for transatlantic data flows known as the \"E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield,\" which is intended to replace the Safe Harbor regime, but the details of how this will operate in practice and the compliance implications for our business are not yet clear. The U.S. government, including the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Commerce, is continuing to review the need for greater regulation over the collection of personal information and information about consumer behavior on the Internet and on mobile devices, and the E.U. has proposed reforms to its existing data protection legal framework. Various government and consumer agencies worldwide have also called for new regulation and changes in industry practices. In addition, in some cases, we are dependent upon our platform providers to solicit, collect and provide us with information regarding our consumers that is necessary for compliance with these various types of regulations.\nPlayer interaction with our games is subject to our privacy policy, end user license agreements, and terms of service. If we fail to comply with our posted privacy policy, EULAs, or terms of service, or if we fail to comply with existing privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations, it could result in proceedings or litigation against us by governmental authorities or others, which could result in fines or judgments against us, damage our reputation, impact our financial condition and harm our business. If\nregulators, the media, or consumers raise any concerns about our privacy and data protection or consumer protection practices, even if unfounded, this could also result in fines or judgments against us, damage our reputation, negatively impact our financial condition, and damage our business.\nWe may not be able to maintain our distribution relationships with key vendors and customers.\nWe have subsidiaries that distribute interactive entertainment software and hardware products and provide related services in Germany and the United Kingdom, respectively, and via export in other European countries for a variety of entertainment software publishers, many of which are our competitors, and hardware manufacturers. From time to time, these subsidiaries also maintain exclusive relationships to serve certain retail customers. These services are generally performed subject to limited-term arrangements. Although we expect to use reasonable efforts to retain these vendors and retail customer relationships, we may not be successful in this regard. The cancellation or non-renewal of one or more of these arrangements could negatively impact our business.\nCredit card or other fraud could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA substantial portion of the subscription revenues generated by World of Warcraft, as well as revenues generated from other sales through Battle.net, are paid by subscribers using credit cards. At times, there may be attempts to use fraudulently obtained credit card numbers to pay for our products and services. Additionally, the credit card numbers and other sensitive or personally identifiable information of World of Warcraft's subscribers and Battle.net account holders are maintained in a proprietary database that may be subject to malicious intrusion by hackers or otherwise compromised internally or externally. As fraudulent schemes become more sophisticated, it may become more difficult and more costly for us to detect credit card or other fraud and we may be required to incur costs to implement additional security measures to protect subscriber information. An increase in credit card or other fraud could have adverse consequences. In addition, we may be subject to legal claims or legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations and actions, if there is loss, disclosure or misappropriation of or access to our customers' credit card or other sensitive or personally identifiable information.\nData breaches involving the source code for our products or customer, consumer or employee data stored by us, or by a third party operating on our behalf, could negatively impact our business.\nIn the course of our day-to-day business, we and third parties operating on our behalf create, store and/or use commercially sensitive information, such as the source code and game assets for our interactive entertainment software products and confidential information with respect to our customers, consumers and employees. A malicious intrusion by hackers or other breach of the systems on which such source code and assets, account information (including personally identifiable information) and other sensitive data is stored could lead to piracy of our software, fraudulent activity, disclosure or misappropriation of, or access to, our customers', consumers' or employees' personally identifiable information or our own sensitive business data. A data intrusion into a server for a game with online features or for Battle.net could also disrupt the operation of such game or platform. If we are subject to data security breaches, or a security-related incident which materially disrupts the availability of our products and services, we may have a loss in sales or subscriptions or be forced to pay damages or incur other costs, including from the implementation of additional security measures, or suffer reputational damage. Moreover, even if there were a public perception that our data protection measures are inadequate, whether or not the case, it could result in reputational damage and potential harm to our business relationships or the public perception of our business model. In addition, we may be subject to legal claims or proceedings in connection with data security breaches, including regulatory investigations and actions.\nWe rely on complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business. Any significant system or network disruption could negatively impact our business.\nWe rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks, some of which are within Activision Blizzard and some of which are managed and/or hosted by third-party providers. All information technology systems and networks are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources, including but not limited to cyber- attacks, malicious software, security breach, energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication failures. We may also face sophisticated attacks, referred to as advanced persistent threats, which are cyber-attacks aimed at compromising our intellectual property and other commercially-sensitive information, such as the source code and game assets for our software or confidential customer or employee information, which remain undetected for prolonged periods of time. Information technology system or network failure or security breach could negatively impact our business continuity, operations and financial results. These risks extend to the networks and e-commerce sites of console platform providers and other partners who sell and host our content online. We may incur additional costs to remedy the damages caused by these disruptions or security breaches.\nOur results of operations or reputation may be harmed as a result of offensive consumer-created content.\nWe are subject to risks associated with the collaborative online features in our games which allow consumers to post narrative comments, in real time, that are visible to other consumers. From time to time, objectionable and offensive consumer content may be posted to a gaming or other site with online chat features or game forums which allow consumers to post comments. We may be subject to lawsuits, governmental regulation or restrictions, and consumer backlash (including decreased sales and harmed reputation), as a result of consumers posting offensive content. We may also be subject to consumer backlash from comments made in response to postings we make on social media sites such as Facebook, YouTube and Twitter.\nIf one or more of our titles were found to contain objectionable undisclosed content, our business may be negatively impacted.\nThroughout the history of the interactive entertainment industry, many interactive software products have included hidden content and/or hidden gameplay features, some of which have been accessible through the use of in-game codes or other technological means, that are intended to enhance the gameplay experience. In some cases, such undisclosed content or features have been considered to be objectionable. While publishers are required to disclose pertinent hidden content during the ESRB ratings process, in a few cases, publishers have failed to disclose hidden content, and the ESRB has required the recall of the game, changed the rating or associated content descriptors originally assigned to the product, required the publisher to change the game or game packaging and/or imposed fines on the publisher. Retailers have on occasion reacted to the discovery of such undisclosed content by removing these games from their shelves, refusing to sell them and demanding that their publishers accept them as product returns. Likewise, some interactive entertainment software consumers have reacted to the revelation of undisclosed content by refusing to purchase such games, demanding refunds for games they have already purchased, refraining from buying other games published by the company whose game contained the objectionable material, and, on at least one occasion, filing a lawsuit against the publisher of the product containing such content.\nWe have implemented preventive measures designed to reduce the possibility of objectionable undisclosed content from appearing in the interactive software products we publish. Nonetheless, these preventive measures are subject to human error, circumvention, overriding and reasonable resource constraints. If an interactive software product we publish is found to contain undisclosed content, we could be subject to any of these consequences.\nWe may not be able to adequately adjust our cost structure in a timely fashion in response to a sudden decrease in demand.\nIn the event of a significant decline in demand for one or more of our products, we may not be able to reduce personnel or make other changes to our cost structure without disrupting our operations or incurring costs. Further, we may not be able to implement such actions in a timely manner, if at all, to offset an immediate shortfall in revenues and profit. Moreover, cost-reduction actions may decrease our employee morale and result in the failure to execute upon our business plan due to the loss of employees or impact our ability to retain or recruit key employees. In addition, any such action may involve the risk that our senior management's attention will be excessively diverted from our other operations.\nProvisions in our corporate documents and Delaware state law could delay or prevent a change of control.\nOur Amended and Restated Bylaws contain a provision regulating the ability of shareholders to bring matters for action before annual and special meetings. The regulations on shareholder action could make it more difficult for any person seeking to acquire control of the Company to obtain shareholder approval of actions that would support this effort. In addition, our Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of so-called \"blank check\" preferred stock. This ability of our Board of Directors to issue and fix the rights and preferences of preferred stock could effectively dilute the interests of any person seeking control or otherwise make it more difficult to obtain control.\nWe have a number of large shareholders who may sell a large volume of our stock, which could cause our stock price to decrease.\nWe have a number of large shareholders, including ASAC. The sale of a substantial number of shares of common stock by ASAC or any other large shareholder within a short period of time could cause our stock price to decrease, and make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of shares of our common stock.\nCatastrophic events may disrupt our business.\nOur corporate headquarters and our primary corporate disaster center are located in the Los Angeles, California area and our disaster recovery data center is in Las Vegas, Nevada, each of which is near a major earthquake fault. A major earthquake or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems, or otherwise prevents us from conducting our normal business operations, could require significant expenditures to resume operations and have a material adverse effect on our business. While we maintain insurance coverage for some of these events, the potential liabilities associated with such events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. Further, our system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Any such event could also limit the ability of retailers, distributors or our other customers to sell or distribute our products.\nIf general economic conditions decline, demand for our products could decline.\nPurchases of our products and services involve discretionary spending on the part of consumers. Consumers are generally more willing to make discretionary purchases, including purchases of products and services like ours, during periods in which favorable economic conditions prevail. As a result, our products are sensitive to general economic conditions and economic cycles. A reduction or shift in domestic or international consumer spending could result in an increase in our selling and promotional expenses, in an effort to offset that reduction, and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe uncertainty of worldwide economic conditions makes budgeting and forecasting very difficult.\nWe are unable to predict worldwide economic conditions, and all of the effects those conditions may have on our business. In particular, the uncertainty of future worldwide economic conditions subjects our forecasts to heightened risks and uncertainties.", "PERMNO": 79678, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "ATVI"}
