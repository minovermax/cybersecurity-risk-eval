RISK FACTORS\nWe, like other financial institutions, face a number of risks inherent to our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and capital position. These risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results or the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report.\nThe risks described in this report are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known by us or that we currently deem to be immaterial, or that are generally applicable to all financial institutions, also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations or capital position.\nRISKS RELATING TO THE BUSINESS and economic ENVIRONMENT AND OUR INDUSTRY\nA significant portion of our business is concentrated in Puerto Rico, where economic and fiscal challenges have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact us.\nOur credit exposure is concentrated in Puerto Rico, which accounted as of December 31, 2019 for approximately 82% of our revenues, 78% of our total assets and 79% of our deposits. As such, our financial condition and results of operations are dependent upon the general trends of the Puerto Rico economy and, in particular, the residential and commercial real estate markets and asset values in Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico entered recession in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 and its gross national product (GNP) thereafter contracted in real terms every year between fiscal years 2007 and 2018 (inclusive), except fiscal year 2012. Pursuant to the latest Puerto Rico Planning Board (the \u201cPlanning Board\u201d) estimates, published in July 2019, the Commonwealth\u2019s real GNP for fiscal years 2017 and 2018 decreased by 3% and 4.7%, respectively. The Planning Board\u2019s report projected an increase in real GNP of approximately 2% and 3.6% in fiscal years 2019 and 2020, respectively, in part due to the influx of federal funds and private insurance payments that followed Hurricanes Irma and Mar\u00eda. The Commonwealth\u2019s ability to achieve such projections, however, will depend to a large extent on the amount federal disaster relief funding actually received and the timing of the approval and disbursement of such funds.\nThe Commonwealth\u2019s government has also been facing significant fiscal challenges. The structural imbalance between revenues and expenditures, on the one hand, and unfunded legacy pension obligations, on the other hand, coupled with the Commonwealth\u2019s inability to access financing in the capital markets or from private lenders, resulted in the Commonwealth and various public corporations defaulting on and eventually seeking to restructure their debts.\nThe Commonwealth\u2019s fiscal and economic crisis prompted the U.S. Congress to enact the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act (\u201cPROMESA\u201d) in June 2016. PROMESA, among other things, established a seven-member federally-appointed oversight board (the \u201cOversight Board\u201d) with broad powers over the finances of the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities and provided to the Commonwealth, its public corporations and municipalities, broad-based restructuring authority, including through a bankruptcy-type process similar to that of Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. In August 2016, President Obama appointed the seven voting members of the Oversight Board through the process established in PROMESA, which authorized the President to select the members from several lists required to be submitted by congressional leaders. The constitutionality of such appointments, however, is currently being challenged before the U.S. Supreme Court. Any outcome that results in the voidance of the Oversight Board\u2019s past actions could create further fiscal instability and adversely affect the Puerto Rico economy.\nThe credit quality of BPPR\u2019s loan portfolio necessarily reflects, among other things, the general economic conditions in Puerto Rico and other adverse conditions affecting Puerto Rico consumers and businesses. The prolonged recession resulted in limited loan demand and in an increase in the rate of foreclosures and delinquencies on loans granted in Puerto Rico. The measures taken to address the fiscal crisis and those that may have to be taken in the future could affect many of our individual customers and customers\u2019 businesses, which could cause credit losses that adversely affect us. Fiscal adjustments have resulted and may continue to result in significant resistance from local politicians and other stakeholders, which may lead to social and political instability. Any reduction in consumer spending because of these issues may also adversely impact our interest and non-interest revenues.\nIf global or local economic conditions worsen or the Government of Puerto Rico is unable to manage its fiscal crisis, including completing an orderly restructuring of its debt obligations while continuing to provide essential services, those adverse effects could continue or worsen in ways that we are not able to predict and that are outside of our control. Under such circumstances, we could experience an increase in the level of provision for loan losses, nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and reserve for credit losses. These factors could have a material adverse impact on our earnings and financial condition.\nOur assets and revenue composition by geographical area and by business segment reporting are presented in Note 40 to the consolidated financial statements in the Annual Report in this Form 10-K.\nFurther deterioration in collateral values of properties securing our commercial, mortgage loan and construction portfolios would result in increased credit losses and continue to harm our results of operations.\nThe value of properties in some of the markets we serve, in particular in Puerto Rico, declined during the past decade as a result of adverse economic conditions. Further deterioration of the value of real estate collateral securing our commercial, mortgage loan and construction loan portfolios would result in increased credit losses. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 28%, 26% and 3%, of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial loans secured by real estate, mortgage loans and construction loans, respectively.\nSubstantially our entire loan portfolio is located within the boundaries of the U.S. economy. Whether the collateral is in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands (\u201cUSVI\u201d), the British Virgin Islands (\u201cBVI\u201d) or the U.S. mainland, the performance of our loan portfolio and the collateral value backing the transactions are dependent upon the performance of and conditions within each specific real estate market. General economic conditions in Puerto Rico and fiscal reforms aimed at addressing the current fiscal crisis could cause a further deterioration of the value of the real estate collateral securing our loan portfolios.\nWe measure loan impairment based on the fair value of the collateral, if the loan is collateral dependent, which is derived from estimated collateral values, principally obtained from appraisal reports that take into consideration prices in observed transactions involving similar assets in similar locations, size and supply and demand. An appraisal report is only an estimate of the value of the property at the time the appraisal is made. If the appraisal does not reflect the amount that may be obtained upon any sale or foreclosure of the property, we may not realize an amount equal to the indebtedness secured by the property. In addition, the properties securing these loans may be difficult to dispose of, if foreclosed.\nA further deterioration of the fair value of real estate properties for collateral dependent impaired loans would require increases in our provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses. Any such increase would have an adverse effect on our future financial condition and results of operations. For more information on the credit quality of our construction, commercial and mortgage portfolio, see the Credit Risk section of the Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the Annual Report.\nOur results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by difficult conditions in the U.S. and global financial industries.\nDuring the financial crisis that commenced in 2008, market instability and lack of investor confidence led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce or cease providing funding to borrowers, including other financial institutions. This led to an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies, lack of consumer confidence, increased market volatility and widespread reduction of business activity in general. The resulting economic pressures on consumers and uncertainty about the financial markets adversely affected our industry and our business, results of operations and financial condition. A re-occurrence of these or other difficult conditions would exacerbate the economic challenges facing us and others in the financial industry.\nLegislative and regulatory reforms may have a significant impact on our business and results of operations.\nPopular is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by federal, New York and Puerto Rico banking authorities. Any change in applicable federal, New York or Puerto Rico laws or regulations could have a substantial impact on our operations. Additional laws and regulations may be enacted or adopted in the future that could significantly affect our powers, authority and operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, regulators in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties, have significant discretion and power to prevent or remedy unsafe and unsound practices or violations of laws by banks and bank holding companies. The exercise of this regulatory discretion and power could have a negative impact on Popular. Furthermore, the Commonwealth has enacted various reforms in response to its fiscal and economic problems and is likely to implement additional reforms as part of its obligations under PROMESA.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS\nWe are subject to default risk in our loan portfolio.\nWe are subject to the risk of loss from loan defaults and foreclosures with respect to the loans we originate or acquire. We establish provisions for loan losses, which lead to reductions in our income from operations, in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level which is deemed appropriate by management based upon an assessment of the quality of the loan portfolio in accordance with established procedures and guidelines. This process, which is critical to our financial results and condition, requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments about the future, including forecasts of economic and market\nconditions that might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay the loans. There can be no assurance that management has accurately estimated the level of future loan losses or that Popular will not have to increase the provision for loan losses in the future as a result of future increases in non-performing loans or for other reasons beyond our control. Any such increases in our provisions for loan losses or any loan losses in excess of our provisions for loan losses would have an adverse effect on our future financial condition and result of operations. We will continue to evaluate our provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses and may be required to increase such amounts.\nThe fiscal and economic challenges of some of the jurisdictions in which we operate could materially adversely affect the value and performance of our portfolio of government securities and our loans to government entities in such jurisdictions, as well as the value and performance of commercial, mortgage and consumer loans to private borrowers who have significant relationships with the government or could be directly affected by government action in such jurisdictions. A reduction in Puerto Rico government deposits could also adversely affect our net interest income.\nWe have direct and indirect lending and investment exposure to the Puerto Rico government, its public corporations and municipalities. A deterioration of the Commonwealth\u2019s fiscal and economic condition, including as a result of actions taken by the Commonwealth government or the Oversight Board to address the ongoing fiscal and economic crisis in Puerto Rico, could materially adversely affect the value and performance of our Puerto Rico government obligations, as well as the value and performance of commercial, mortgage and consumer loans to private borrowers who have significant relationships with the government or could be directly affected by government action, resulting in losses to us.\nAt December 31, 2019, our direct exposure to Puerto Rico government obligations was limited to obligations from various municipalities and amounted to $432 million. Of the amount outstanding at December 31, 2019, $391 million consisted of loans and $41 million consisted of securities. These municipal obligations are mostly general obligations backed by property tax revenues and to which the applicable municipality has pledged its good faith, credit and unlimited taxing power, or \u201cspecial obligations\u201d, to which the applicable municipality has pledged other revenues. At December 31, 2019, 75% of our exposure to municipal loans and securities was concentrated in the municipalities of San Juan, Guaynabo, Carolina and Bayam\u00f3n. In May 2019, the Oversight Board designated all 78 municipalities as covered entities under PROMESA. For a discussion of the implications of being designated a covered entity under PROMESA, refer to the Geographic and Government Risk section in the Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of the Annual Report.\nThe Commonwealth\u2019s certified fiscal plan does not contemplate a restructuring of the debts of Puerto Rico\u2019s municipalities. The plan, however, provides for the gradual phase out of Commonwealth appropriations to municipalities, which constitute a material portion of the operating revenues of certain municipalities. Since fiscal year 2017, Commonwealth appropriations to municipalities have been reduced by approximately 64% (from approximately $370 million in fiscal year 2017 to approximately $132 million in fiscal year 2020). The 2019 Commonwealth Fiscal Plan provides for additional reductions in appropriations to municipalities every fiscal year, holding appropriations constant at $112 million starting in fiscal year 2022, before ultimately phasing out all appropriations in fiscal year 2024. Although the certified fiscal plan contemplates that the reduction in subsidies may be offset by other measures, the reduction in subsidies could have a material negative impact on the financial condition of various municipalities, particularly if such offsetting measures are not fully or timely implemented. Furthermore, municipalities may also be affected by the negative effects resulting from other expense, revenue or cash management measures taken to address the Commonwealth\u2019s fiscal and liquidity shortfalls.\nIn addition, at December 31, 2019, the Corporation had $350 million in loans insured or securities issued by Puerto Rico governmental entities but for which the principal source of repayment is non-governmental. These included $276 million in residential mortgage loans insured by the Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority (\u201cHFA\u201d), a governmental instrumentality that has been designated as a covered entity under PROMESA. These mortgage loans are secured by first mortgages on Puerto Rico residential properties and the HFA insurance covers losses in the event of a borrower default and upon the satisfaction of certain other conditions. The Corporation also had at December 31, 2019, $46 million in bonds issued by HFA which are secured by second mortgage loans on Puerto Rico residential properties, and for which HFA also provides insurance to cover losses in the event of a borrower default and upon the satisfaction of certain other conditions. In the event that the mortgage loans insured by HFA and held by the Corporation directly or those serving as collateral for the HFA bonds default and the collateral is insufficient to satisfy the outstanding balance of these loans, HFA\u2019s ability to honor its insurance will depend, among other factors, on the financial condition of HFA at the time such obligations become due and payable. Although the Governor is currently authorized by local legislation to impose a temporary moratorium on the financial obligations of the HFA, she has not exercised this power as of the date hereof. In\naddition, at December 31, 2019, the Corporation had $7 million in securities issued by HFA that have been economically defeased and refunded and for which securities consisting of U.S. agencies and Treasury obligations have been escrowed, and $21 million of commercial real estate notes issued by government entities but that are payable from rent paid by non-governmental parties.\nBPPR\u2019s commercial loan portfolio also includes loans to private borrowers who are service providers, lessors, suppliers or have other relationships with the Puerto Rico government. These borrowers could be negatively affected by the fiscal measures to be implemented to address the Commonwealth\u2019s fiscal crisis and the ongoing debt restructuring proceedings under PROMESA. Similarly, BPPR\u2019s mortgage and consumer loan portfolios include loans to government employees which could also be negatively affected by fiscal measures such as employee layoffs or furloughs.\nFurthermore, BPPR has a significant amount of deposits from the Commonwealth, its instrumentalities, and municipalities. The amount of such deposits may fluctuate depending on the financial condition and liquidity of such entities, as well as on the ability of BPPR to maintain these customer relationships. A portion of such deposits could also be used by the Commonwealth as part of its restructuring agreements under Title III of PROMESA. While a significant decrease in these deposits should not materially affect our liquidity since such deposits are collateralized, a significant decrease in the amount of such deposits could adversely affect our net interest income.\nBPPR also has operations in the USVI and has credit exposure to USVI government entities. At December 31, 2019, BPPR\u2019s direct exposure to USVI instrumentalities and public corporations amounted to approximately $71 million, of which $67 million is outstanding. The USVI has been experiencing a number of fiscal and economic challenges that could adversely affect the ability of its public corporations and instrumentalities to service their outstanding debt obligations. PROMESA does not apply to the USVI and, as such, there is currently no federal legislation permitting the restructuring of the debts of the USVI and its public corporations and instrumentalities. To the extent that the fiscal condition of the USVI continues to deteriorate, the U.S. Congress or the Government of the USVI may enact legislation allowing for the restructuring of the financial obligations of USVI government entities or imposing a stay on creditor remedies, including by making PROMESA applicable to the USVI.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including broker-dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual funds, hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us. There can be no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations or earnings.\nWe have procedures in place to mitigate the impact of a default among our counterparties. We request collateral for most credit exposures with other financial institutions and monitor these on a regular basis. Nonetheless, market volatility could impact the valuation of collateral held by us and result in losses.\nOur ability to raise financing is dependent in part on market confidence. In times when market confidence is affected by events related to well-known financial institutions, risk aversion among participants may increase substantially and make it more difficult for us to borrow in the credit or capital markets.\nOur businesses are subject to extensive regulation and we from time to time receive requests for information from departments of the U.S. and Puerto Rico governments, including those that investigate mortgage-related conduct.\nOur businesses are subject to extensive regulation and we from time to time self-report compliance matters to, or receive requests for information from, departments of the U.S. and Puerto Rico governments. In particular, BPPR has received subpoenas and other requests for information from the departments of the U.S. government that investigate mortgage-related conduct, mainly concerning real estate appraisals and residential and construction loans in Puerto Rico. BPPR has also self-identified and reported to applicable regulators matters with respect to mortgage related practices.\nFor example, in July 2017, management learned that certain letters related to approximately 23,000 residential mortgage loans generated by Popular to comply with Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (\u201cCFPB\u201d) rules requiring written notification to\nborrowers who have submitted a loss mitigation application were not mailed to borrowers over a period of up to approximately three-years due to a systems interface error. Loss mitigation is a process whereby creditors work with mortgage loan borrowers who are having difficulties making their loan payments on their debt. Popular corrected the systems interface error that caused the letters not to be sent, notified applicable regulators (including the CFPB), completed a review of its mortgage files to assess the scope of potential customer impact and conducted outreach and remediation efforts with respect to borrowers potentially affected by the systems interface error.\nIncidents of this nature and/or investigations by governmental authorities (whether arising from these incidents or otherwise) may result in judgments, settlements, fines, enforcement actions, penalties or other sanctions adverse to the Corporation which could materially and adversely affect the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious reputational harm.\nWe are exposed to credit risk from mortgage loans that have been sold or are being serviced subject to recourse arrangements.\nPopular is generally at risk for mortgage loan defaults from the time it funds a loan until the time the loan is sold or securitized into a mortgage-backed security. We have furthermore retained, through recourse arrangements, part of the credit risk on sales of mortgage loans, and we also service certain mortgage loan portfolios with recourse. At December 31, 2019, we serviced $1.2 billion in residential mortgage loans subject to credit recourse provisions, principally loans associated with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac programs. In the event of any customer default, pursuant to the credit recourse provided, we are required to repurchase the loan or reimburse the third-party investor for the incurred loss. The maximum potential amount of future payments that we would be required to make under the recourse arrangements in the event of nonperformance by the borrowers is equivalent to the total outstanding balance of the residential mortgage loans serviced with recourse and interest, if applicable. During 2019, we repurchased approximately $57 million in mortgage loans subject to the credit recourse provisions. In the event of nonperformance by the borrower, we have rights to the underlying collateral securing the mortgage loan. As of December 31, 2019, our liability established to cover the estimated credit loss exposure related to loans sold or serviced with credit recourse amounted to $35 million. We may suffer losses on these loans when the proceeds from a foreclosure sale of the property underlying a defaulted mortgage loan are less than the outstanding principal balance of the loan plus any uncollected interest advanced and the costs of holding and disposing of the related property.\nDefective and repurchased loans may harm our business and financial condition.\nIn connection with the sale and securitization of loans, we are required to make a variety of customary representations and warranties regarding Popular and the loans being sold or securitized. Our obligations with respect to these representations and warranties are generally outstanding for the life of the loan, and they relate to, among other things:\n\uf0b7 compliance with laws and regulations;\n\uf0b7 underwriting standards;\n\uf0b7 the accuracy of information in the loan documents and loan file; and\n\uf0b7 the characteristics and enforceability of the loan.\nA loan that does not comply with these representations and warranties may take longer to sell, may impact our ability to obtain third party financing for the loan, and be unsalable or salable only at a significant discount. If such a loan is sold before we detect non-compliance, we may be obligated to repurchase the loan and bear any associated loss directly, or we may be obligated to indemnify the purchaser against any loss, either of which could reduce our cash available for operations and liquidity. Management believes that it has established controls to ensure that loans are originated in accordance with the secondary market\u2019s requirements, but mistakes may be made, or certain employees may deliberately violate our lending policies. We seek to minimize repurchases and losses from defective loans by correcting flaws, if possible, and selling or re-selling such loans. We have established specific reserves for probable losses related to repurchases resulting from representations and warranty violations on specific portfolios. At December 31, 2019, our reserve for estimated losses from representation and warranty arrangements amounted to $3 million, which was included as part of other liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial condition. Nonetheless, we do not expect any such losses to be significant, although if they were to occur, they would adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nIncreases in FDIC insurance premiums may have a material adverse effect on our earnings.\nSubstantially all the deposits of BPPR and PB are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC\u2019s DIF, and as a result, BPPR and PB are subject to FDIC deposit insurance assessments. We are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance. If there are additional bank or financial institution failures, our level of non-performing assets increases, or our risk profile changes or our capital position is impaired, we may be required to pay even higher FDIC premiums. Any future increases or special assessments may materially adversely affect our results of operations. See the \u201cSupervision and Regulation-FDIC Insurance\u201d discussion within Item 1. Business of the Annual Report for additional information related to the FDIC\u2019s deposit insurance assessments applicable to BPPR and PB.\nOur business is susceptible to interest rate risk because a significant portion of our business involves borrowing and lending money, and investing in financial instruments. Reforms to and uncertainty regarding the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business and financial performance are impacted by market interest rates and movements in those rates. Since a high percentage of our assets and liabilities are interest bearing or otherwise sensitive in value to changes in interest rates, changes in rates, in the shape of the yield curve or in spreads between different types of rates can have a material impact on our results of operations and the values of our assets and liabilities. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, our net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Interest rates are also highly sensitive to many factors over which we have no control and which we may not be able to anticipate adequately, including general economic conditions and the monetary and tax policies of various governmental bodies, particularly the Federal Reserve. For a discussion of the Corporation\u2019s interest rate sensitivity, please refer to the \u201cRisk Management\u201d section of the Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOn July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. It is expected that a transition away from the widespread use of LIBOR to alternative rates will occur over the course of the next several years. As a result of this transition, interest rates on floating rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives and other financial instruments held by the Corporation and tied to LIBOR rates, as well as the revenue and expenses associated with those financial instruments, may be adversely affected. Any failure by market participants and regulators to successfully introduce benchmark rates to replace LIBOR and implement effective transitional arrangements to address the discontinuation of LIBOR could also result in disruption in the financial markets. Further, any uncertainty regarding the continued use and reliability of LIBOR as a benchmark interest rate could adversely affect the value of our floating rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives, and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates.\nRegulators, industry groups and certain committees (e.g., the Alternative Reference Rates Committee) have, among other things, published recommended fallback language for LIBOR-linked financial instruments, identified recommended alternatives for certain LIBOR rates (e.g., the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as the recommended alternative to U.S. Dollar LIBOR), and proposed implementations of the recommended alternatives in floating rate instruments. At this time, it is not possible to predict whether these recommendations and proposals will be broadly accepted, whether they will continue to evolve, and what the effect of their implementation may be on the markets for floating-rate financial instruments.\nIf our goodwill, deferred tax assets or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, it may adversely affect our financial condition and future results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $671 million, $885 million and $23 million, respectively, of goodwill, net deferred tax assets and amortizable intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet. If our goodwill, deferred tax assets or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\nUnder GAAP, we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of the goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in Popular\u2019s stock price related to macroeconomic conditions in the global market as well as\nthe weakness in the Puerto Rico economy and fiscal situation, reduced future cash flow estimates and slower growth rates in the industry.\nThe goodwill impairment evaluation process requires us to make estimates and assumptions with regards to the fair value of our reporting units. Actual values may differ significantly from these estimates. Such differences could result in future impairment of goodwill that would, in turn, negatively impact our results of operations and the reporting unit where the goodwill is recorded. Declines in our market capitalization could also increase the risk of goodwill impairment in the future.\nThe determination of whether a deferred tax asset is realizable is based on weighting all available evidence. The realization of deferred tax assets, including carryforwards and deductible temporary differences, depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income of the same character during the carryback or carryforward period. The analysis considers all sources of taxable income available to realize the deferred tax asset, including the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards, taxable income in prior carryback years and tax-planning strategies.\nIf we are required to record a charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements because an impairment of the goodwill, deferred tax assets or amortizable intangible assets is determined, our results of operations would be adversely affected.\nWe could be adversely affected by changes in accounting standards or policies.\nThe preparation of the Corporation\u2019s financial statements is based on accounting standards established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as more detailed accounting policies established by the Corporation\u2019s management. From time to time these accounting standards or accounting policies may change, and in some cases these changes could have a material effect on the Corporations\u2019 financial statements and may adversely affect its financial results or investor perceptions of those results.\nFor example, beginning January 1, 2020, the Corporation and other U.S. companies were required to implement a new accounting standard, commonly referred to as the Current Expected Credit Losses (\u201cCECL\u201d) framework, which requires earlier recognition of expected credit losses on loans and certain other instruments, replacing the incurred loss model. The Corporation expects that under CECL, it will need to, among other things, increase the allowance for loan and lease losses, which may have a negative impact on the Corporation\u2019s capital levels. This new accounting standard may present operational challenges and will require the Corporation to change how it makes assumptions and estimates on loan and lease losses as well as other financial assets. Also, this new accounting standard may result in greater volatility of the Corporation\u2019s earnings and capital levels and could potentially affect the Corporation\u2019s capital distribution plans, depending upon final guidance from regulators. For additional information on this and other accounting standards, see Note 3, \u201cNew Accounting Pronouncements\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report in this Form 10-K.\nOur compensation practices are subject to oversight by applicable regulators.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to retain key senior leaders, and competition for such senior leaders can be intense in most areas of our business. Our compensation practices are subject to review and oversight by the Federal Reserve Board. We also may be subject to limitations on compensation practices by the FDIC or other regulators, which may or may not affect our competitors.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires the U.S. financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve Board, the other federal banking agencies and the SEC, to adopt rules prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation or that could lead to a material financial loss at specified regulated entities having at least $1 billion in total assets (including Popular, PNA, BPPR and PB). The U.S. financial regulators proposed revised rules in 2016, which have not been finalized. Compliance with such revised rules may substantially affect the manner in which we structure compensation for our executives and other employees. For a more detailed discussion of these proposed rules, see the \u201cSupervision and Regulation-Incentive Compensation\u201d section within Item 1. Business of the Annual Report.\nThe scope and content of the U.S. banking regulators\u2019 policies on executive compensation are continuing to develop and are likely to continue evolving in the near future. It cannot be determined at this time whether compliance with such policies will adversely affect the ability of Popular and our subsidiaries to hire, retain and motivate key employees. Limitations on our compensation practices could have a negative impact on our ability to attract and retain talented senior leaders in support of our long-term strategy.\nAs a holding company, we depend on dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries for liquidity.\nWe are a bank holding company and depend primarily on dividends from our banking and other operating subsidiaries to fund our cash needs. These obligations and needs include capitalizing subsidiaries, repaying maturing debt and paying debt service on outstanding debt. Our banking subsidiaries, BPPR and PB, are limited by law in their ability to make dividend payments and other distributions to us based on their earnings and capital position. In addition, based on its current financial condition, PB may not declare or pay a dividend without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board and the NYSDFS. A failure by our banking subsidiaries to generate sufficient cash flow to make dividend payments to us may have a negative impact on our results of operation and financial position. Also, a failure by the bank holding company to access sufficient liquidity resources to meet all projected cash needs in the ordinary course of business may have a detrimental impact on our financial condition and ability to compete in the market.\nWe are subject to risk related to our own credit rating; actions by the rating agencies or having capital levels below well-capitalized could raise the cost of our obligations, which could affect our ability to borrow or to enter into hedging agreements in the future and may have other adverse effects on our business.\nActions by the rating agencies could raise the cost of our borrowings since lower rated securities are usually required by the market to pay higher rates than obligations of higher credit quality. Our credit ratings were reduced substantially in 2009, and our senior unsecured ratings are now \u201cnon-investment grade\u201d with the three major rating agencies. The market for non-investment grade securities is much smaller and less liquid than for investment grade securities. Therefore, if we were to attempt to issue preferred stock or debt securities into the capital markets, it is possible that there would not be sufficient demand to complete a transaction and the cost could be substantially higher than for more highly rated securities.\nOur banking subsidiaries currently do not use borrowings that are rated by the major rating agencies, as these banking subsidiaries are funded primarily with deposits and secured borrowings. At December 31, 2019, the banking subsidiaries had $9 million in deposits that were subject to rating triggers.\nIn addition, changes in our ratings and capital levels below well-capitalized could affect our relationships with some creditors and business counterparties. For example, a portion of our hedging transactions include ratings triggers or well-capitalized language that permit counterparties to either request additional collateral or terminate our agreements with them based on our below investment grade ratings. Although we have been able to meet any additional collateral requirements thus far and expect that we would be able to enter into agreements with substitute counterparties if any of our existing agreements were terminated, changes in our ratings or capital levels below well capitalized could create additional costs for our businesses.\nOur banking subsidiaries have servicing, licensing and custodial agreements with third parties that include ratings covenants. Servicing rights represent a contractual right and not a beneficial ownership interest in the underlying mortgage loans. Upon failure to maintain the required credit ratings, the third parties could have the right to require us to engage a substitute fund custodian and/or increase collateral levels securing the recourse obligations. Popular services residential mortgage loans subject to credit recourse provisions. Certain contractual agreements require us to post collateral to secure such recourse obligations if our required credit ratings are not maintained. Collateral pledged by us to secure recourse obligations approximated $66 million at December 31, 2019. We could be required to post additional collateral under the agreements. Management expects that we would be able to meet additional collateral requirements if and when needed. The requirements to post collateral under certain agreements or the loss of custodian funds could reduce our liquidity resources and impact its operating results. The termination of those agreements or the inability to realize servicing income for our businesses could have an adverse effect on those businesses. Other counterparties are also sensitive to the risk of a ratings downgrade and the implications for our businesses and may be less likely to engage in transactions with us, or may only engage in them at a substantially higher cost, if our ratings remain below investment grade.\nWe are subject to regulatory capital adequacy guidelines, and if we fail to meet these guidelines our business and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nUnder regulatory capital adequacy guidelines, and other regulatory requirements, Popular and our banking subsidiaries must meet guidelines that include quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items, subject to qualitative judgments by regulators regarding components, risk weightings and other factors. If we fail to meet these minimum capital guidelines and other regulatory requirements, our business and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected. If a financial holding company fails to maintain well-capitalized status under the regulatory framework, or is deemed not well managed under regulatory exam procedures, or if it experiences certain regulatory violations, its status as a financial holding company and its related eligibility for a streamlined review process for acquisition proposals, and its ability to offer certain financial products, may be compromised and its financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision published Basel IV in December 2017. Basel IV significantly revises the Basel capital framework, and the impact on us will depend on the manner in which the revisions are implemented in the U.S. See the \u201cSupervision and Regulation - Capital Adequacy\u201d discussion within Item 1. Business of the Annual Report for additional information related to the Basel III Capital Rules and Basel IV.\nThe resolution of pending litigation and regulatory proceedings, if unfavorable, could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects.\nWe face legal risks in our businesses, and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain high. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects. For further information relating to our legal risk, see Note 26 - \u201cCommitments & Contingencies\u201d, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report in this Form 10-K.\nComplying with economic sanctions programs and anti-money laundering laws and regulations can increase our operational and compliance costs and risks. If we, and our subsidiaries, affiliates or third-party service providers are found to have failed to comply with applicable economic sanctions programs and anti-money laundering laws and regulations, we could be exposed to fines, sanctions and other penalties, as well as governmental investigations.\nAs a regulated financial institution, we must comply with regulations and federal economic and trade sanctions and embargo programs administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d) of the U.S. Treasury, as well as anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including those under the Bank Secrecy Act.\nEconomic and trade sanctions regulations and programs administered by OFAC prohibit U.S.-based entities from entering into or facilitating unlicensed transactions with, for the benefit of, or in some cases involving the property and property interests of, persons, governments or countries designated by the U.S. government under one or more sanctions regimes, and also prohibit transactions that provide a benefit that is received in a country designated under one or more sanctions regimes. We are also subject to a variety of reporting and other requirements under the Bank Secrecy Act, including the requirement to file suspicious\nactivity and currency transaction reports, that are designed to assist in the detection and prevention of money laundering, terrorist financing and other criminal activities. In addition, as a financial institution we are required to, among other things, identify our customers, adopt formal and comprehensive anti-money laundering programs, scrutinize or altogether prohibit certain transactions of special concern, and be prepared to respond to inquiries from U.S. law enforcement agencies concerning our customers and their transactions.\nFailure by the Corporation, its subsidiaries, affiliates or third-party service providers to comply with these laws and regulations could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the Corporation, including the possibility of regulatory enforcement or other legal action, including significant civil and criminal penalties. We can also incur higher costs and face greater compliance risks in structuring and operating our businesses to comply with these requirements. The markets in which we operate heighten these costs and risks.\nWe have established risk-based policies and procedures designed to assist us and our personnel in complying with these applicable laws and regulations. With respect to OFAC regulations and economic sanction programs, these policies and procedures employ software to screen transactions for evidence of sanctioned-country and person\u2019s involvement. Consistent with a risk-based approach and the difficulties in identifying and where applicable, blocking and rejecting transactions of our customers or our customers\u2019 customers that may involve a sanctioned person, government or country, there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will prevent us from violating applicable laws and regulations in transactions in which we engage, and such violations could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. Various state and municipal governments, universities and other investors maintain prohibitions or restrictions on investments in companies that do business involving sanctioned countries or entities, and a violation of applicable U.S. laws and regulations could adversely affect the market for our securities.\nFrom time to time we have identified and voluntarily self-disclosed to OFAC transactions that were not timely identified and blocked by our policies and procedures for screening transactions that might violate the regulations and economic sanctions programs administered by OFAC. There can be no assurances that any failure to comply with U.S. sanctions and embargoes, or with anti-money laundering laws and regulations, will not result in material fines, sanctions or other penalties being imposed on us.\nFurthermore, if the policies and procedures of one of the Corporation\u2019s third-party service providers do not prevent it from violating applicable laws and regulations in transactions in which it engages, such violations could adversely affect its ability to provide services to us, and, in the case of EVERTEC, could adversely affect the value of our investment in EVERTEC.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR OPERATIONS\nWe are subject to a variety of cybersecurity risks that, if realized, could adversely affect how we conduct our business.\nInformation security risks for large financial institutions such as Popular have increased significantly in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, such as Internet and mobile banking to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states, hacktivists and other parties. In the ordinary course of business, we rely on electronic communications and information systems to conduct our operations and to store sensitive data. We employ a defensive approach that employs people, processes and technology to manage and maintain cybersecurity controls. We employ a variety of preventative and detective tools to monitor, block, and provide alerts regarding suspicious activity, as well as to identify suspected advanced persistent threats. Notwithstanding our defensive measures and the significant resources we devote to protect the security of our systems, there is no assurance that all of our security measures will be effective, especially as the threat from cyber-attacks is continuous and severe, attacks are becoming more sophisticated and increasing in volume, and attackers respond rapidly to changes in defensive measures. We have been the target of phishing scams in the past targeting our customers as a result of compromised email accounts of several Popular employees. We have addressed the vulnerabilities that permitted the compromise and implemented enhanced security measures, and will continue to take appropriate steps in the future to improve the security of our systems. There can be no assurances, however, that there will not be further breaches of sensitive customer information in the future.\nThe most significant cyber-attack risks that we may face are e-fraud, denial-of-service, ransomware and computer intrusion that might result in loss of customer or proprietary data. Loss from e-fraud occurs when cybercriminals\nbreach and extract funds from customer or bank accounts. Denial-of-service disrupts services available to our customers through our on-line banking system. Computer intrusion attempts might result in the breach of sensitive customer data, such as account numbers and social security numbers, and could present significant reputational, legal and/or regulatory costs to Popular if successful. Risks and exposures related to cyber security attacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as due to the expanding use of Internet banking, mobile banking and other technology-based products and services by us and our customers. Although we are regularly targeted by unauthorized parties, we have not, to date, experienced any material losses as a result of cyber-attacks.\nA successful penetration or circumvention of the security of our systems could cause serious negative consequences for us, including significant disruption of our operations and those of our clients, customers and counterparties, misappropriation of confidential information of us or that of our clients, customers, counterparties or employees, or damage to computers or systems of us and those of our clients, customers and counterparties, and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to us or to our customers, loss of confidence in our security measures, customer dissatisfaction, significant litigation exposure and harm to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on us. In particular, if personal, non-public, confidential or proprietary information in our possession were to be mishandled or misused, we could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage and financial loss. For a discussion of the guidance that federal banking regulators have released regarding cybersecurity and cyber risk management standards, see \u201cRegulation and Supervision\u201d in Part I, Item 1 - Business, included in this Annual Report. Such mishandling or misuse could include, for example, if such information were erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, either by fault of our systems, employees, or counterparties, or where such information is intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties.\nWe rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology functions and the provision of information technology and business process services. The most important of these third-party service providers for us is EVERTEC, and certain risks particular to EVERTEC are discussed below under \u201cRisks Relating to Our Relationship with EVERTEC.\u201d The success of our business depends in part on the continuing ability of these (and other) third parties to perform these functions and services in a timely and satisfactory manner, which performance could be disrupted or otherwise adversely affected due to failures or other information security events originating at the third parties or at the third parties\u2019 suppliers or vendors (so-called \u201cfourth party risk\u201d). We may not be able to effectively monitor or mitigate fourth-party risk, in particular as it relates to the use of common suppliers or vendors by the third parties that perform functions and services for us.\nAs cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our layers of defense or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. System enhancements and updates may also create risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones. Due to the complexity and interconnectedness of information technology systems, the process of enhancing our layers of defense can itself create a risk of systems disruptions and security issues. In addition, addressing certain information security vulnerabilities, such as hardware-based vulnerabilities, may affect the performance of our information technology systems. The ability of our hardware and software providers to deliver patches and updates to mitigate vulnerabilities in a timely manner can introduce additional risks, particularly when a vulnerability is being actively exploited by threat actors.\nWe rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure.\nThird parties provide key components of our business operations such as data processing, information security, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, Internet connections and network access. The most important of these third-party service providers for us is EVERTEC, and certain risks particular to EVERTEC are discussed below under \u201cRisks Relating to Our Relationship with EVERTEC.\u201d While we select third-party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including those resulting from disruptions in services provided by a vendor, breaches of a vendor\u2019s systems, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, failure of a vendor to provide services for any reason or poor performance of services, or failure of a vendor to notify us of a reportable event, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise conduct our business. Financial or operational difficulties of a third-party vendor could also hurt our operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendor\u2019s ability to serve us. Replacing these third-party vendors could also create significant delay and expense. Accordingly, use of such third parties creates an unavoidable inherent risk to our business operations.\nIn addition, the assessment and management by financial institutions of the risks associated with third party vendors have been subject to greater regulatory scrutiny. We expect to incur additional costs and expenses in connection with our oversight of third party relationships, especially those involving significant banking functions, shared services or other critical activities. Our failure to properly manage risks associated to our third party relationships could result in potential liability to clients and customers, fines, penalties or judgments imposed by our regulators, increased operating expenses and harm to our reputation, any of which could materially and adversely affect us.\nUnforeseen or catastrophic events, including extreme weather events and other natural disasters, man-made disasters or the emergence of pandemics, could cause a disruption in our operations or other consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Extreme weather events could be exacerbated by climate change.\nThe occurrence of unforeseen or catastrophic events in the markets in which we do business, including extreme weather events and other natural disasters, man-made disasters, or the emergence of pandemics could cause a disruption in our operations and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. A significant portion of our operations are located in Puerto Rico, the USVI and BVI, a region susceptible to hurricanes, earthquakes and other similar events. For example, in 2017, our operations in Puerto Rico, the USVI and BVI were significantly disrupted by the impact of Hurricanes Irma and Mar\u00eda. In January 2020, Puerto Rico was impacted by a magnitude 6.4 earthquake which caused island-wide power outages and significant damage to infrastructure and property in the southwest region of the island. Future natural disasters can again cause disruption to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We maintain insurance against natural disasters including coverage for lost profits and extra expense; however, there is no insurance against the disruption that a catastrophic natural disaster could produce to the markets that we serve and the potential negative impact to economic activity. Further, future natural disasters in any of our market areas could again adversely impact the ability of borrowers to timely repay their loans and may further adversely impact the value of any collateral held by us. Man-made disasters, pandemics, and other events connected with the regions in which we operate could have similar effects. For example, a novel strain of coronavirus surfaced in Wuhan, China in December 2019, resulting in increased travel restrictions and extended shutdown of certain businesses in the region. Instances of coronavirus have begun to spread around the world. The impact of the coronavirus on our business is uncertain at this time and will depend on future developments, but prolonged closures may disrupt our operations and the operations of our suppliers, service providers and customers, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. The severity and impact of future hurricanes, earthquakes, pandemics and other similar events are difficult to predict and, in particular in the case of hurricanes, may be exacerbated by global climate change. The effects of climate change could also adversely impact the financial condition of our clients or the value of any collateral held by us, which could also have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nrisks related to acquisition transactions\nPotential acquisitions of businesses or loan portfolios could increase some of the risks that we face, and may be delayed or prohibited due to regulatory constraints.\nTo the extent permitted by our applicable regulators, we will pursue strategic acquisition opportunities. Acquiring other banks or businesses, however, involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among other things, potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company, exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company, potential disruption to our business, the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company, and difficulty in estimating the value of the target company. If in connection with an acquisition we pay a premium over book or market value, some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction. Furthermore, failure to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSimilarly, acquiring loan portfolios involves various risks. When acquiring loan portfolios, management makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of the loans, including the creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of secured loans. In estimating the extent of the losses, we\nanalyze the loan portfolio based on historical loss experience, volume and classification of loans, volume and trends in delinquencies and nonaccruals, local economic conditions, and other pertinent information. If our assumptions are incorrect, however, our actual losses could be higher than estimated and increased loss reserves may be needed to respond to different economic conditions or adverse developments in the acquired loan portfolios, which would negatively affect our operating results.\nFinally, certain acquisitions by financial institutions, including us, are subject to approval by a variety of federal and state regulatory agencies. Regulatory approvals could be delayed, impeded, restrictively conditioned or denied due to existing or new regulatory issues we have. We may fail to pursue, evaluate or complete strategic and competitively significant acquisition opportunities as a result of our inability, or perceived or anticipated inability, to obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner, under reasonable conditions or at all. Difficulties associated with potential acquisitions that may result from these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe failure to successfully integrate Reliable\u2019s business and operations may adversely affect our ability to realize the anticipated acquisition benefits and could adversely affect our results of operations. Incorrect assumptions and judgements regarding the fair value of the assets acquired could negatively affect our operating results.\nOn August 1, 2018, Popular Auto, LLC, Banco Popular de Puerto Rico\u2019s auto finance subsidiary, completed the acquisition of certain assets and the assumption of certain liabilities related to Wells Fargo & Company\u2019s (\u201cWells Fargo\u201d) auto finance business in Puerto Rico (\u201cReliable\u201d). Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from such acquisition, including synergies and operational efficiencies, in the amounts and within the timeframes we expect, will depend on the effective and timely transition and integration of Reliable\u2019s business and operations. Problems may arise in successfully integrating Reliable\u2019s business and operations, including, without limitation, unexpected costs as a result of any unrecorded liabilities or issues not identified during the due diligence investigation of the business and that may not be subject to indemnification or reimbursement under the acquisition agreement, any failure to comply with banking and consumer protection laws and regulations, and any adverse effects on our ability to maintain relationships with customers, employees and service providers. The failure to successfully transfer and integrate Reliable\u2019s business and operations may adversely affect our ability to realize the anticipated acquisition benefits and could adversely affect our results of operations. Furthermore, as part of the transition and integration, we may find that our assumptions and judgements regarding the fair value of the assets acquired, including the collectability of the loans and value of the collateral, could be inaccurate causing our actual losses to be higher than estimated, negatively affecting our operating results.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH EVERTEC\nWe are dependent on EVERTEC for certain of our core financial transaction processing and information technology services, which exposes us to a number of operational risks that could have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn connection with the sale of a 51% ownership interest in EVERTEC in the third quarter of 2010, we entered into a long-term Amended and Restated Master Services Agreement (the \u201cMSA\u201d) with EVERTEC, pursuant to which we agreed to receive from EVERTEC, on an exclusive basis, certain core banking and financial transaction processing and information technology services. The term of the MSA extends until September 30, 2025. Under the MSA, we also granted EVERTEC a right of first refusal over certain services or products and development projects related to the services thereunder provided. We also entered into several other agreements, generally coterminous with the MSA, pursuant to which BPPR agreed to sponsor EVERTEC as an independent sales organization with respect to certain credit card associations, agreed to certain exclusivity and non-solicitation restrictions with respect to merchant services, and agreed to support the ATH brand and network, among other matters. As a result, we are now dependent on EVERTEC for the provision of essential services to our business, including our core banking business, and there can be no assurances that the quality of the services will be appropriate or that EVERTEC will be able to continue to provide us with the necessary financial transaction processing and technology services. As a result, our relationship with EVERTEC exposes us to a number of operational, cybersecurity and business risks that could have a material adverse effect on us.\nAs a result of our agreements with EVERTEC, we are particularly exposed to the operational risks of EVERTEC, including those relating to a breakdown or failure of EVERTEC\u2019s systems or internal controls environment, as a result of security breaches or attacks, employee error or malfeasance, system breakdowns, vulnerabilities or otherwise. Over the term of the MSA, we have experienced various interruptions and delays in key services provided by EVERTEC. Future interruptions in the operation of EVERTEC\u2019s information systems, or cyberattacks to, or breaches to the confidentiality of the information that resides in such systems, could harm our business by disrupting our delivery of services, expose us to regulatory, legal and compliance risk and\ndamage our reputation, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. For further information regarding our cybersecurity risks, refer to the \u201cWe are subject to a variety of cybersecurity risks that, if realized, could adversely affect how we conduct our business\u201d risk factor. Our ability to recover from EVERTEC for breach of the MSA may not fully compensate us for the damages we may suffer as a result of such breach.\nIf EVERTEC is unable to meet constant technological changes and evolving industry standards, we may be unable to enhance our current services and introduce new products and services in a timely and cost-effective manner, placing us at a competitive disadvantage and significantly affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe banking and financial services industry is rapidly evolving and it is highly competitive on the basis of the quality and variety of products and services offered, innovation, price and other factors. In order to compete effectively, we need to constantly develop enhancements to our product and service offerings and introduce new products and services that keep pace with developments in the financial services industry and satisfy shifting customer needs and preferences. These enhancements and new products and services require the delivery of technology services by EVERTEC pursuant to the MSA, making our success dependent on EVERTEC\u2019s ability to timely complete and introduce these enhancements and new products and services in a cost-effective manner.\nSome of our competitors rely on financial services technology and outsourcing companies that are much larger than EVERTEC and that may have better technological capabilities and product offerings. Furthermore, EVERTEC is highly leveraged, which, besides exposing it to a number of financial and business risks, requires it to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow to meeting debt service requirements, reducing its operational flexibility and ability to invest resources in capital and other expenditures to improve and develop its business services in a constantly changing environment. In addition, financial services technology companies typically make capital investments to develop and modify their product and service offerings to facilitate their customers\u2019 compliance with the extensive and evolving regulatory and industry requirements, and in most cases such costs are borne by the technology provider. Because of our relationship with EVERTEC, however, we may be required to bear the full cost of such developments and modifications pursuant to the MSA.\nIf EVERTEC\u2019s technology services are not competitive in terms of price, speed and scalability versus comparable offerings from larger companies, our future success may be adversely affected. Furthermore, if our relationship with EVERTEC hinders our ability to compete successfully, including by satisfying shifting customer needs and preferences through enhancements to our existing products and services and the introduction of new products and services that keep pace with developments in the financial services industry, our ability to attract and retain customers and to match products and services offered by competitors could be impaired and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nOur ability to transition to a new financial services technology provider, and to replace the other services that are provided to us by EVERTEC, may be lengthy and complex.\nSwitching from one vendor of core bank processing and related technology services to a new vendor is a complex process that carries business and financial risks, even where such a switch can be accomplished without violating our contractual obligations to EVERTEC. The implementation cycle for such a transition can be lengthy and require significant financial and management resources from us. Such a transition can also expose us, and our clients, to increased costs (including conversion costs) and business disruption. If we decided to transition to a new financial services technology provider, either at the end of the term of the MSA and related agreements or earlier upon the occurrence of an early termination thereunder, these potential transition risks could result in an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although EVERTEC has agreed to provide certain transition assistance to us in connection with the termination of the MSA, we are ultimately dependent on their ability to provide those services in a responsive and competent manner. Furthermore, we may require transition assistance from EVERTEC beyond the term of the MSA, delaying and lengthening any transition process away from EVERTEC while increasing related costs.\nUnder the MSA, we are required to provide written notice of non-renewal no less than one year prior to the relevant termination date in order to avoid an automatic three-year renewal. In practice, however, if we decided to switch to a new provider, we would have to commence procuring and working on a transition process much earlier and such process may extend beyond the current term of the MSA. Furthermore, if we were unsuccessful or decided not to complete the transition after expending significant funds and management resources, it could also result in an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe value of our remaining ownership interest in EVERTEC, and the revenues we derive from EVERTEC, could be materially reduced if we decided not to renew our agreements with EVERTEC or were to terminate them before the expiration of their term.\nWe continue to have a 16.19% ownership interest in EVERTEC and account for this investment under the equity method. As such, we include our investment in EVERTEC in other assets and our proportionate share of income or loss is included in other operating income in our consolidated statements of operations. For 2019, our share of EVERTEC\u2019s changes in equity recognized in income was $17.3 million. The carrying value of our investment in EVERTEC was, as of December 31, 2019, approximately $74 million. Meanwhile, the services EVERTEC delivers to us represent a significant portion of EVERTEC\u2019s revenues (approximately 45% for 2019). As a result, if we were not to renew the MSA and our other agreements with EVERTEC, or otherwise terminate them before the end of their term, EVERTEC\u2019s financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected and the value of our remaining ownership interest in EVERTEC, and the income we report from this investment, may be materially reduced. Furthermore, revenue from EVERTEC\u2019s merchant acquiring business, which constitutes approximately 22% of EVERTEC\u2019s revenues, depends, in part, on EVERTEC\u2019s alliance with BPPR. If such relationship were to suffer, EVERTEC\u2019s business may be adversely affected.\nFurthermore, future sales of our EVERTEC common stock, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of EVERTEC common stock and thus the value we may be able to realize on the sale of our remaining holdings.\nRISKS RELATING TO AN INVESTMENT IN OUR SECURITIES\nThe issuance of additional shares of equity securities could further dilute existing holders of our Common Stock.\nWe have not issued equity securities since 2010, other than in connection with compensation plans or our dividend reinvestment plan. In the future, however, we may raise capital through public or private equity financings to fund our operations or expansions, to pursue acquisitions or to increase our capital to comply with regulatory capital measures. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities, or instruments that are convertible into equity securities, the ownership interest of our existing common stockholders would be reduced, the new equity securities may have rights and preferences superior to those of our Common Stock or outstanding Preferred Stock, and the issuance could be at a price which is dilutive to current stockholders.\nDividends on our Common Stock and Preferred Stock may be suspended and stockholders may not receive funds in connection with their investment in our Common Stock or Preferred Stock without selling their shares.\nHolders of our Common Stock and Preferred Stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. During 2009, we suspended dividend payments on our Common Stock and Preferred Stock. We resumed payment of dividends on our Preferred Stock in December 2010 and on our Common Stock in October 2015. There can be no assurance that any dividends will be declared on the Preferred Stock or Common Stock in any future periods.\nThis could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock and Preferred Stock. Also, we are a bank holding company and our ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain Federal regulatory considerations, including the guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board regarding capital adequacy and dividends. It is Federal Reserve Board policy that bank holding companies should pay dividends on common stock only out of the net income available to common stock over the past year and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organization\u2019s current and expected future capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition.\nIn addition, the terms of our outstanding junior subordinated debt securities held by each trust that has issued trust preferred securities, prohibit us from declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on our capital stock, including our Common Stock and Preferred Stock, or from purchasing, acquiring, or making a liquidation payment on such stock, if we have given notice of our election to defer interest payments but the related deferral period has not yet commenced or a deferral period is continuing.\nAccordingly, stockholders may have to sell some or all of their shares of our Common Stock or Preferred Stock in order to generate cash flow from their investment. Stockholders may not realize a gain on their investment when they sell the Common Stock or Preferred Stock and may lose the entire amount of their investment.\nCertain of the provisions contained in our Certificate of Incorporation have the effect of making it more difficult to change the Board of Directors, and may make the Board of Directors less responsive to stockholder control.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that the members of the Board of Directors are divided into three classes as nearly equal as possible. At each annual meeting of stockholders, one-third of the members of the Board of Directors will be elected for a three-year term, and the other directors will remain in office until their three-year terms expire. Therefore, control of the Board of Directors cannot be changed in one year, and at least two annual meetings must be held before a majority of the members of the Board of Directors can be changed. Our certificate of incorporation also provides that a director, or the entire Board of Directors, may be removed by the stockholders only for cause by a vote of at least two -thirds of the combined voting power of the outstanding capital stock entitled to vote for the election of directors. These provisions have the effect of making it more difficult to change the Board of Directors, and may make the Board of Directors less responsive to stockholder control. These provisions also may tend to discourage attempts by third parties to acquire Popular because of the additional time and expense involved and a greater possibility of failure, and, as a result, may adversely affect the price that a potential purchaser would be willing to pay for the capital stock, thereby reducing the amount a stockholder might realize in, for example, a tender offer for our capital stock.\nFor further information of other risks faced by Popular please refer to the Management\u2019s Discussion & Analysis section of the Annual Report.", "PERMNO": 16505, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "BPOP"}
