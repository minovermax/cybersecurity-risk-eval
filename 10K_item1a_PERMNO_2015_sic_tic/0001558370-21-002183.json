{"cik": "1169988", "company": "BOINGO WIRELESS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this report on Form 10-K, including our accompanying consolidated financial statements and the related notes, before deciding whether to purchase shares of our common stock. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. The price of our common stock and the trading price of our Convertible Notes could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Merger with White Sands Parent, Inc.\nFailure to complete, or delays in completing, the potential Merger with White Sands Parent, Inc. and White Sands Bidco, Inc. announced on March 1, 2021 and disruptions in our business caused by the potential Merger could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, business, financial results and/or stock price.\nOn February 26, 2021, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to which, if all of the conditions to closing are satisfied or waived, we will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, pursuant to the Merger. Consummation of the Merger is subject to certain closing conditions, a number of which are not within our control. Any failure to satisfy these required conditions to closing may prevent, delay or otherwise materially adversely affect the completion of the transaction. We cannot predict with certainty whether or when any of the required closing conditions will be satisfied or if another uncertainty may arise and cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully consummate the proposed Merger as currently contemplated under the Merger Agreement or at all.\nOur efforts to complete the Merger could cause substantial disruptions in, and create uncertainty surrounding, our business, which may materially adversely affect our results of operation and our business. Uncertainty as to whether the Merger will be completed may affect our ability to recruit prospective employees or to retain and motivate existing employees. Employee retention may be particularly challenging while the transaction is pending because employees may experience uncertainty about their roles following the transaction. Uncertainty as to our future could adversely affect our business and our relationship with suppliers, customers, regulators and other business partners. For example, potential customers may defer decisions about working with us or seek to change existing business relationships with us. Additionally, the adverse effects of the pendency of the transaction could be exacerbated by any delays in completion of the transaction or termination of the Merger Agreement. Changes to, or termination of, existing business relationships could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, as well as the market price of our common stock. The adverse effects of the pendency of the transaction could be exacerbated by any delays in completion of the transaction or termination of the Merger Agreement.\nRisks related to the failure of the proposed Merger to be consummated include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf under some circumstances, we may be required to pay a termination fee to Parent of $19.6 million, or $13.1 million if we terminate for specified reasons during the go-shop period;\n\u25cf we will remain liable for significant transaction costs, including legal, accounting, financial advisory and other costs relating to the Merger regardless of whether the Merger is consummated;\n\u25cf the trading price of our common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price for our stock reflects a market assumption that the Merger will be completed;\n\u25cf the attention of our management and employees may have been diverted to the Merger rather than to our own operations and the pursuit of other opportunities that could have been beneficial to us;\n\u25cf we could be subject to litigation related to the Merger and any failure to complete the Merger;\n\u25cf the potential loss of key personnel during the pendency of the Merger as employees and other service providers may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us following completion of the Merger; and\n\u25cf under the Merger Agreement, we are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to completing the Merger, which restrictions could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business as we otherwise would have done if we were not subject to these restrictions.\nThe occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, business, and our stock price.\nWe cannot be sure if or when the Merger will be completed.\nThe consummation of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of various conditions, including the authorization of the Merger by our stockholders. We cannot guarantee that the closing conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement will be satisfied. If we are unable to satisfy the closing conditions or if other mutual closing conditions are not satisfied, Parent and Merger Sub will not be obligated to complete the Merger. Under certain circumstances, we would be required to pay Parent a termination fee of $19.6 million, or $13.1 million if we terminate for specified reasons during the go-shop period.\nIf the Merger is not completed, our board of directors, in discharging its fiduciary obligations to our stockholders, will evaluate our strategic direction.\nUntil the Merger is completed, the Merger Agreement restricts us from taking specified actions without the consent of the other party, and, in regards to us, generally requires us to operate in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice. These restrictions may prevent us from making appropriate changes to our respective businesses or pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the Merger.\nThe consideration received at the time of the Merger may be lower than the public trading value of shares of our common stock when we entered into the Merger Agreement.\nThe Merger Agreement provides that each share of our common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares of our to be canceled or to remain outstanding pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement) shall be canceled and shall be converted automatically into the right to receive an amount in cash, net of applicable withholding taxes and without interest, equal to $14.00. If the public trading value of shares of our common stock increases over the period of time required to satisfy the Merger\u2019s closing conditions, the consideration received at the time of the Merger may be lower than the public trading value of shares of our common stock when we entered into the Merger Agreement.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that, following expiration of a go-shop period, limit our ability to pursue alternatives to the Merger, could discourage a potential competing acquirer of us from making an alternative transaction proposal and, in specified circumstances, could require us to pay a termination fee of up to $19.6 million.\nFollowing a 25-business day go-shop period, the Merger Agreement provides that we shall not, and requires us to refrain from permitting our representatives to, among other things, solicit, participate in negotiations with respect to or approve or recommend any third party proposal for an alternative transaction, subject to exceptions set forth in the Merger Agreement relating to the receipt of certain unsolicited proposals. Further, while our board of directors is permitted to make a recommendation change to our stockholders with respect to the Merger under certain circumstances, unless the Merger Agreement is terminated and a termination fee is paid per the requirements of the Merger Agreement, we will be required to submit the proposals to a stockholder vote at a special meeting.\nWhile we do have the benefit of a 25-business day go-shop period, these provisions could discourage a potential third-party acquirer or merger partner that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant portion of us or pursuing an alternative transaction from considering or proposing such a transaction, even if it were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share cash or market value than the consideration in the Merger, or might result in a potential third-party acquirer or merger partner proposing to pay a lower price to our stockholders than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee that may become payable in certain circumstances.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated and we determine to seek another business combination, we may not be able to negotiate a transaction with another party on terms comparable to, or better than, the terms of the Merger.\nLawsuits may be filed against us and the members of our board of directors arising out of the proposed merger, which may delay or prevent the proposed Merger.\nPutative stockholder complaints, including stockholder class action complaints, and other complaints may be filed against us, or our board of directors, and others in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The outcome of litigation is uncertain, and we may not be successful in defending against any such future claims. Lawsuits that may be filed against us, our board of directors, or against Parent or Merger Sub could delay or prevent the Merger, divert the attention of our management and employees from our day-to-day business and otherwise adversely affect us financially.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe face risks related to health epidemics, including the recent COVID-19 pandemic, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur business has been and could continue to be adversely affected by a widespread outbreak of contagious disease, including the COVID-19 pandemic. Global health concerns relating to the COVID-19 pandemic have been weighing on the macroeconomic environment, and the pandemic has significantly increased economic volatility and uncertainty.\nThe pandemic has also resulted in government authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place or stay-at-home orders, and business shutdowns. While some restrictions have been lifted in certain states, many restrictions continue to remain in place and some restrictions that have previously been lifted have been reinstituted. A portion of our business is impacted by travel and consumer spending, because users seek to access the mobile Internet while they are on-the-go, and because spending on Internet access is often a consumer discretionary spending decision. Decreased travel and discretionary spending has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business such as our Carrier Services, Legacy retail, Legacy wholesale Wi-Fi, and Legacy advertising revenues. As the pandemic continues, we have seen some improvements in passenger traffic at our managed and operated venue locations. Additionally, the pandemic has had and could continue to have an effect on our business generally due to decreased economic activity.\nThe spread of COVID-19 has also caused us to modify our business practices and transition our corporate employees to a work from home model. We have limited employee travel, and transitioned to virtual sales activities, meetings, events, and conferences, and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers and business partners. Such actions could also impact our ability to fully integrate businesses we have acquired or may acquire in the future. There is no certainty that such actions will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus or otherwise be satisfactory to government authorities. If significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively, including due to illness, quarantines, social distancing, government actions or other restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, our operations will be impacted.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the pandemic, its severity, the actions to contain the virus or address its impact, how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating activities can resume, and to the extent any new restrictions are reinstituted. While our agreements with our carrier partners and Multifamily customers are multi-year contracts and are not generally affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced an overall decrease in new customer sales and may continue to do so during the duration of the pandemic. Additionally, while our customers have paid our invoices as they become due, we cannot be certain they will continue to do so and while our suppliers have provided us with necessary goods and services required for us to operate our business, we cannot be certain they will not experience difficulties in continuing to do so. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience an adverse impact to our business as a result of its global economic impact and altered economic behaviors, including any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future.\nThere are no comparable recent events which may provide guidance as to the effect of the spread of COVID-19 and the pandemic, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar health pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of COVID-19\u2019s impact on our business, our operations, or the global economy as a whole. However, the effects may have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations.\nA significant portion of our revenue is dependent on our relationships with our venue and network partners, and if these relationships are impaired or terminated, or if our partners do not perform as expected, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe depend on our relationships with venue partners, particularly key venue partners and military bases, in order to manage and operate DAS, tower, small cell, and Wi-Fi networks. These relationships generate a significant portion of our revenue and allow us to generate wholesale revenues and new retail customers. Our agreements with our venue partners, telecom operators, and wholesale customers are for defined periods and of varying durations. In order to maintain our relationships with venue partners, we may need to upgrade our networks or make other changes to our products and services we provide such venue partners, which would, in most cases, require significantly higher initial capital expenditures than we have historically incurred, and if we are unsuccessful, our relationships could be impaired. If our venue partners terminate or fail to renew these agreements, our ability to generate and retain wholesale and retail customers would be diminished, which might result in a significant disruption of our business and adversely affect our operating results. Further, any delays in our ability to complete the upgrade of our networks or build-out new networks can adversely affect our operating results.\nWe depend on our relationships with network partners to allow users to roam across networks that we do not manage or operate. A significant portion of our revenue depends on maintaining these relationships with network partners. Some network partners may compete with us for retail customers and may decide to terminate our partnerships and instead develop competing retail products and services. Our network partner agreements are for defined periods and of varying durations. If our network partners terminate these agreements, or fail to renew these agreements, our ability to retain retail customers could be diminished and our network reach could be reduced, which could result in a significant disruption of our business and adversely affect our operating results.\nOur operating results may fluctuate unexpectedly, which makes them difficult to predict and may cause us to fail to meet the expectations of investors, adversely affecting our stock price.\nWe operate in a highly dynamic industry and our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly, especially as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our revenue and operating results may vary from quarter-to-quarter due to many factors, many of which are not within our control. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. Further, it is difficult to accurately forecast our revenue, margin and operating results, and if we fail to match our expected results or the results expected by financial analysts, the trading price of our common stock and Convertible Notes and the price at which our convertible noteholders could sell the common stock received upon conversion of the Convertible Notes may be adversely affected.\nFactors that contribute to fluctuations in our operating results from quarter-to-quarter include those described in this risk factor section including:\n\u25cf our gain or loss of a key venue partner, military partner, or wholesale partner;\n\u25cf the rate at which individuals adopt and continue to use our solutions;\n\u25cf the timing and success of new technology introductions by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf the number of air travel passengers;\n\u25cf the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u25cf the growing prevalence of free Wi-Fi models and our ability to adapt and compete with free Wi-Fi;\n\u25cf intellectual property disputes; and\n\u25cf general economic conditions in our domestic and foreign markets.\nDue to these and other factors, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our historical operating results should not be relied upon as accurate indicators of our future performance.\nA substantial portion of our business depends on the demand for our DAS, tower, and small cell networks, which is driven primarily by demand from our telecom customers and demand for data, and we may be adversely affected by any slowdown in such demand. A reduction in the amount or change in the mix of network investment by our telecom customers may materially and adversely affect our business (including reducing demand for tenant additions or network services).\nCustomer demand for our DAS, tower, and small cell networks depends on the mix of network investment by our telecom customers and the demand for data from end users. The willingness of our customers to utilize our systems, including DAS, tower, and small cell networks, or renew or extend existing contracts on our systems, is affected by numerous factors, including:\n\u25cf availability or capacity of our DAS, tower, and small cell networks;\n\u25cf location of our DAS, tower, and small cell networks;\n\u25cf financial condition of our customers, including their profitability and availability or cost of capital;\n\u25cf willingness of our customers to maintain or increase their network investment or changes in their capital allocation strategy;\n\u25cf consumers\u2019 and organizations\u2019 demand for data;\n\u25cf need for integrated networks and organizations;\n\u25cf availability and cost of spectrum for commercial use;\n\u25cf increased use of network sharing, roaming, joint development, or resale agreements by our customers;\n\u25cf mergers or consolidations by and among our customers;\n\u25cf changes in, or success of, our customers\u2019 business models;\n\u25cf governmental regulations and initiatives, including local or state restrictions on the proliferation of communications infrastructure;\n\u25cf cost of constructing our DAS, tower, and small cell networks;\n\u25cf our market competition;\n\u25cf technological changes, including those (1) affecting the number or type of communications infrastructure needed to provide data to a given geographic area or which may otherwise serve as a substitute or alternative to our communications infrastructure or (2) resulting in the obsolescence or decommissioning of certain existing wireless networks; and\n\u25cf our ability to efficiently satisfy our customers\u2019 service requirements.\nA slowdown in demand for our DAS, tower, and small cell networks or data generally may negatively impact our growth or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us. If our customers or potential customers are unable to raise adequate capital to fund their business plans, as a result of disruptions in the financial and credit markets or otherwise, they may reduce their spending, which could adversely affect our anticipated growth or the demand for our DAS, tower, and small cell networks.\nThe amount, timing, and mix of our customers\u2019 network investment is variable and can be significantly impacted by the various matters described in these risk factors. Changes in customer network investment typically impact the demand for our DAS, tower, and small cell networks. As a result, changes in customer plans such as delays in the implementation of new systems, new and emerging technologies, or plans to expand coverage or capacity may reduce demand for our DAS, tower, and small cell networks. Furthermore, the industries in which our customers operate (particularly those in the wireless industry) could experience a slowdown or slowing growth rates as a result of numerous factors, including a reduction in consumer demand (including demand for wireless connectivity) or general economic conditions. There can be no assurances that weakness or uncertainty in the economic environment will not adversely impact our customers or their industries, which may materially and adversely affect our business, including by reducing demand for DAS, tower, and small cell networks. Such an industry slowdown or a reduction in customer network investment may materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe may be unsuccessful in expanding into new venue types, which could harm the growth of our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe are negotiating with existing and prospective partners to expand our managed and operated DAS, tower, small cell, and Wi-Fi network footprint in venue types where we historically have had only a limited presence. Expansion into these venue types, which may include shopping malls, stadiums, hospitals, retail stores and quick service restaurants, may require significantly higher initial capital expenditures than we have historically incurred. In contrast to Wi-Fi network build-outs at venues such as airports, where telecom operators typically pay the substantial expense of laying cable or fiber, we may be required to incur the initial capital expense of access points and related hardware and cabling at tens of thousands of quick serve restaurant locations and hundreds of shopping malls, hospitals, retail stores and stadium locations. Further, growth into these new venue types have been and may be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic as some of these venue types experience decreased traffic and demand. Additionally, in August 2018 we closed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Elauwit Networks, LLC (\u201cElauwit\u201d) for our entrance into the multifamily venue type. We have minimal experience in servicing the multifamily venues and we may not be successful in growing and managing this business.\nWe may not be able to execute on our strategy or there may not be returns on these investments in the near future or at all. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business depends upon demand for connected services that rely on wireless network infrastructure. Our ability to adapt to the speed of changes and anticipate market adoption of new technologies may adversely impact our business.\nOur future success depends upon growing demand for wireless connected services. The demand for wireless connectivity may decrease or may grow more slowly than expected. Any such decrease in the demand or slowing rate of growth could have a material adverse effect on our business. The continued demand for wireless connectivity services depends on the continued proliferation of smartphones, tablets and other wireless connection enabled devices. Our revenue is derived from the demand from consumers for internet connectivity, including our retail offerings, and from our wholesale partners attempting to provide consumers with greater connectivity. We may face challenges as we seek to increase the revenue generated from the usage on smartphones, tablets and other wireless connected devices.\nA portion of our business depends on the continued integration of Wi-Fi as a standard feature in wireless connected devices. If Wi-Fi ceases to be a standard feature in wireless connected devices, or if the rate of integration of Wi-Fi on devices decreases or is slower than expected, the market for our services may be substantially diminished.\nCompeting technologies pose a risk to the continued use of Wi-Fi as a mobile wireless connectivity technology. The introduction and market acceptance of emerging wireless technologies such as 5G, LTE-U, Super Wi-Fi and CBRS, could cause significant disruption to our Wi-Fi business, which may result in a loss of customers, users and revenue. If users find emerging wireless technologies to be sufficiently fast, convenient or cost effective, we may not be able to compete effectively, and our ability to attract or retain users will be impaired. Additionally, one or more of our partners may deploy emerging wireless technologies that could reduce the partner\u2019s need to work with us and may result in significant loss of revenue and reduction of the Wi-Fi hotspots in our network.\nWe deliver value to our users by providing simple access to Wi-Fi hotspots, regardless of whether we manage and operate the hotspot, or the hotspot is operated by a partner. As a result, our business depends on our ability to anticipate and quickly adapt to changing technological standards and advances. If technological standards change and we fail to adapt accordingly, our business and revenue may be adversely affected. Furthermore, the proliferation of new mobile devices and operating platforms poses challenges for our research and development efforts. If we are unable to create simple solutions for a particular device or operating platform, we will be unable to effectively attract users of these devices or operating platforms and our business will be adversely affected.\nWe may not maintain our revenue.\nAlthough our revenue has increased substantially over the last few years with the decline in 2020 driven primarily by the pandemic, we may not be able to maintain our revenue. We believe that our revenue will depend, among other factors, on successfully implementing our business strategies, including our ability to:\n\u25cf retain our existing partners and attract new partners;\n\u25cf develop new sources of revenue from our users and partners as revenue for products and services for older technologies continue to decline;\n\u25cf expand into new markets;\n\u25cf react to changes in the way individuals access and use the mobile Internet;\n\u25cf attract new users and keep existing subscribers actively using our services;\n\u25cf identify and integrate the acquisition of new businesses;\n\u25cf increase the awareness of our brand; and\n\u25cf provide our users with a superior experience, including customer support and payment experiences.\nHowever, we cannot guarantee that we will successfully implement any of these business strategies.\nThe U.S. government may modify, curtail or terminate one or more of our contracts.\nWe have dedicated a significant amount of resources to building out Wi-Fi networks for troops stationed on military bases pursuant to our contracts with the U.S. government. Military revenue comprises a substantial part of our overall revenue and the U.S. government may modify, curtail or terminate its contracts with us, either at its convenience or for default based on performance. Any such modification, curtailment, or termination of one or more of our government contracts could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flow and/or financial position.\nNegotiations with prospective or existing partners and telecom operators and network operators can be lengthy and unpredictable, which may cause our operating results to vary.\nOur negotiations with prospective or existing venue partners, including large venues like airports, transportation hubs, stadiums, arenas, military bases, multifamily properties, universities, convention centers, office campuses and other partners, to acquire Wi-Fi locations to operate or to acquire roaming rights on partners\u2019 networks, or for new partners to implement our solutions or to extend or amend current arrangements, can be lengthy, and in some cases can last over 12 months. Because of the lengthy negotiation cycle, the time required to reach a final or amended agreement with a partner is unpredictable and may lead to variances in our operating results from quarter to quarter. Negotiations with prospective and existing partners also require substantial time, effort and resources. We may ultimately fail in our negotiations, resulting in costs to our business without any associated benefits.\nAdditionally, our negotiations with telecom operators and network operators who pay us build-out fees and recurring access fees can likewise be lengthy and, therefore, the time required to reach a final or amended agreement with telecom or network operators is unpredictable and may lead to variances in our operating results from quarter to quarter.\nOur industry is competitive and if we do not compete successfully, we could lose market share, experience reduced revenue or suffer losses.\nThe market for commercial wireless infrastructure solutions is competitive and impacted by technological change, and we expect competition with our current and potential competitors to intensify in the future. Some of our competitors have taken steps or may decide to more aggressively compete against us, particularly in the market for venue build-outs of DAS, tower, small cell, and Wi-Fi solutions.\nOur competitors, many of whom are also our partners, include a variety of telecom operators, network operators, and tower companies, including Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, Comcast, Charter, Altice and local operators. These and other competitors have developed or may develop technologies that compete directly with our solutions. Many of our competitors are substantially larger than we are and have substantially longer operating histories. We may not be able to fund or invest in certain areas of our business to the same degree as our competitors. Many have substantially greater product development and marketing budgets and other financial and personnel resources than we do. Some also have greater name and brand recognition and a larger base of subscribers or users than we have. In addition, our competitors may provide services that we generally do not, such as cellular, local exchange and long-distance services, voicemail and digital subscriber line. Users that desire these services may choose to also obtain mobile wireless connectivity services from a competitor that provides these additional services rather than from us.\nFurthermore, we rely on several of our competitors as partners in roaming agreements. The roaming agreements provide that our retail customers and our wholesale partners\u2019 customers may use the Wi-Fi networks of our partners. One or more of our partners may deploy competing technologies that could reduce the partner\u2019s need to work with us\nunder a roaming agreement. If our partners decide to terminate our roaming agreements, our global network of wireless networks may be reduced, which may result in a significant disruption to our business.\nCompetition could increase our selling and marketing expenses and related customer acquisition costs. We may not have the financial resources, technical expertise or marketing and support capabilities to continue to compete successfully. A failure to respond to established and new competitors may adversely impact our business and operating results.\nWe may be unsuccessful in expanding our international operations, which could harm the growth of our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe operate in several foreign markets, including Brazil, the U.K., and the United Arab Emirates and we continue to assess expansion in international markets. Our ability to expand internationally involves various risks, including the need to invest significant resources in unfamiliar markets, and the possibility that there may not be returns on these investments in the near future or at all. In addition, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur expenses before we generate any material revenue in these new markets. Our expansion plans will require significant management attention and resources. We have limited experience in selling our solutions in international markets or in conforming to local cultures, standards or policies. We may not be able to compete successfully in these international markets. Our ability to expand will also be limited by the demand for mobile Internet in international markets. Different privacy, censorship and liability standards and regulations and different intellectual property laws in foreign countries may cause our business and operating results to suffer.\nAny future international operations may fail to succeed due to risks inherent in foreign operations, including:\n\u25cf different technological solutions for mobile Internet than those used in North America;\n\u25cf varied, unfamiliar and unclear legal and regulatory restrictions;\n\u25cf unexpected changes in international regulatory requirements and tariffs;\n\u25cf legal, political, social or systemic restrictions on the ability of U.S. companies to do business in foreign countries;\n\u25cf currency fluctuations;\n\u25cf Foreign Corrupt Practices Act compliance and related risks;\n\u25cf difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u25cf difficulties in enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable, and longer payment cycles, especially in emerging markets;\n\u25cf reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; and\n\u25cf potential adverse tax consequences.\nSome of our business partners also have international operations and are subject to the risks described above. Even if we successfully manage the risks of international operations, our business may be adversely affected if our business partners are not able to successfully manage these risks.\nAs a result of these obstacles, we may find it difficult or prohibitively expensive to expand internationally or we may be unsuccessful in our attempt to do so, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nAcquisitions could be difficult to identify, pose integration challenges, divert the attention of management, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe have in the past acquired and may in the future seek to acquire or invest in businesses, products or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our business or otherwise offer growth opportunities. Acquisitions may disrupt our business, divert our resources and require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for development of our existing business.\nIn addition, we may not be able to integrate the acquired personnel, operations and technologies successfully, or effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition. We also may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquired business due to a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf inability to integrate or benefit from acquired technologies or services in a profitable manner;\n\u25cf unanticipated costs, accounting charges or other liabilities associated with the acquisition;\n\u25cf incurrence of acquisition-related costs;\n\u25cf difficulty integrating operations, personnel and accounting and other systems of the acquired business;\n\u25cf difficulty in forecasting future revenues and costs of any acquired business due to unfamiliarity with the business or challenges in integrating or benefit from acquired technologies or services in a profitable manner;\n\u25cf difficulties and additional expenses associated with supporting legacy products and hosting infrastructure of the acquired business, including due to language, geographical or cultural differences;\n\u25cf difficulty converting the customers of the acquired business onto our contract terms, including disparities in the revenues, licensing, support or services model of the acquired company;\n\u25cf adverse effects to our existing business relationships with business partners and customers as a result of the acquisition;\n\u25cf the potential loss of key employees;\n\u25cf use of resources that are needed in other parts of our business; and\n\u25cf use of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate the acquisition.\nIn addition, a significant portion of the purchase price of companies we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill and other intangible assets, which must be assessed for impairment at least annually. In the future, if our acquisitions do not yield expected returns, we may be required to take charges to our operating results based on this impairment assessment process, which could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, our exposure to risks associated with various claims, including the use of intellectual property, may be increased as a result of acquisitions of other companies. For example, we may have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to intellectual property or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks with respect to the acquired company or technology. In addition, third parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology that has not been asserted prior to our acquisition.\nAcquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, if an acquired business fails to meet our expectations, our operating results, business and financial position may suffer.\nWe rely on our credit facility to fund a significant portion of our capital expenditures and other capital needs. If we are unable to achieve compliance with the credit facility covenants, or interest rates increase significantly, or we are unable to renew our credit facility on favorable terms, or at all, our business would be negatively impacted.\nIn February 2019, we entered into a Credit Agreement (\u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) and related agreements with Bank of America, N.A. acting as agent for lenders named therein. The Credit Agreement places restrictions on our ability to take certain actions and sets standards for minimum financial performance. If we fail to comply with the terms and conditions of this Credit Agreement, then the line of credit may be withdrawn, and the additional funds will not be available to us to fund our capital needs. Further such restrictions on our ability to take certain actions could reduce our flexibility to run and manage our business which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWorldwide economic and other conditions, and their impact on travel and consumer spending, may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur business is impacted by travel and consumer spending, because users seek to access the mobile Internet while they are on-the-go, and because spending on Internet access is often a consumer discretionary spending decision. Factors that tend to negatively impact levels of travel include the impact of public health epidemics, such as COVID-19, high unemployment, high energy prices, low business and consumer confidence, the fear of terrorist attacks, war and other macroeconomic factors. Economic conditions that tend to negatively impact levels of discretionary consumer spending include high unemployment, high consumer debt, reductions in net worth, depressed\nreal estate markets, increased taxation, high energy prices, high interest rates, low consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors. If the current global economic growth is slower than expected, or if it weakens, our retail customer base, new retail customer acquisition and usage-based revenue could be materially harmed, and our results of operations would be adversely affected.\nThe regulation of Internet communications, products and services is currently uncertain, which poses risks for our business from changes in laws, regulations, and interpretation or enforcement of existing laws or regulations.\nThe current regulatory environment for Internet communications, products and services is uncertain. Many laws and regulations were adopted prior to the advent of the Internet and related technologies and often do not contemplate or address the specific issues associated with the Internet and related technologies. The scope of laws and regulations applicable to the Internet, including Net Neutrality, remains uncertain and is subject to statutory or interpretive change. We cannot be certain that we, our partners or our users are currently in compliance with regulatory or other legal requirements in the numerous countries in which our service is used. Our failure or the failure of our partners, users and others with whom we transact business, or to whom we license the Boingo solution, to comply with existing or future regulatory or other legal requirements could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Regulators may disagree with our interpretations of existing laws or regulations or the applicability of existing laws or regulations to our business, and existing laws, regulations and interpretations may change in unexpected ways.\nWe believe that the Boingo solution is on the forefront of wireless infrastructure connectivity, and therefore it may face greater regulatory scrutiny than other communications products and services. We enter into various exclusive agreements for our DAS, tower, and small cell services with venues such as airports, transportation hubs, stadiums/arenas, universities, convention centers, and office campuses. Recently, there has been action and commentary within the Federal Communications Commission that is adverse to exclusive access arrangements for DAS and other exclusive arrangements. If the FCC continues to move forward on regulations that are adverse to our exclusive DAS, tower, and small cell arrangements or our other exclusive arrangements, our business, revenues and profits could be significantly harmed. Further, we cannot be certain what positions regulators may take regarding our compliance with, or lack of compliance with, other current and future legal and regulatory requirements or what positions regulators may take regarding any past or future actions we have taken or may take in any jurisdiction. Regulators may determine that we are not in compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and impose penalties, or we may need to make changes to the Boingo solution, which could be costly and difficult. Any of these events would adversely affect our operating results and business.\nIf we lose key personnel or are unable to attract and retain personnel on a cost-effective basis, our business could be harmed.\nOur performance is substantially dependent on the continued services and performance of our senior management and our highly qualified team of engineers, many of whom have numerous years of experience and specialized expertise in our business and technology. If we are not successful in hiring and retaining highly qualified engineers, we may not be able to extend or maintain our engineering and technological expertise and our future product and service development efforts could be adversely affected. Additionally, the process of attracting and retaining suitable replacements for any executive officers or any of our highly qualified engineers we lose in the future would result in transition costs and would divert the attention of other members of our senior management from our existing operations. Additionally, such a loss could be negatively perceived in the capital markets. If we lose members of our senior management, this may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our strategic objectives and adversely affect our operating results.\nOur future success also depends on our ability to identify, attract, hire, train, retain and motivate highly skilled managerial, operations, business development and marketing personnel, especially personnel that has experience in our business and industry. We have in the past maintained a rigorous, highly selective and time-consuming hiring process. We believe that our approach to hiring has significantly contributed to our success to date. However, our highly selective hiring process has made it more difficult for us to hire a sufficient number of qualified employees, and, as we grow, our hiring process may prevent us from hiring the personnel we need in a timely manner. Moreover, the cost of living in the Los Angeles area, where our corporate headquarters is located, has been an impediment in the past to attracting new employees. While this impediment has decreased due to our remote workforce, to the extent we transition back to an in-person workforce in Los Angeles, we may experience difficulty in hiring personnel. If we fail to attract, integrate and retain the necessary personnel, we may not be able to grow effectively, and our business could suffer significantly.\nOur business depends on strong brands, and if we do not cost effectively develop, maintain and enhance our brand, our financial condition and operating results could be harmed.\nWe believe that the Boingo brand is a critical part of our business and that developing and maintaining awareness of our brand is important to achieving widespread acceptance of the Boingo solution and is an important element in attracting and retaining customers and partners. We continue to seek new ways to promote our brand through our managed and operated hotspots. We intend to enhance our brand through low cost co-marketing arrangements with our partners and through periodic promotional and sponsorship activities and by continuing to leverage the reach of social media to interact with our customers. In order to maintain strong relationships with our venue and network partners, we may have to reduce the visibility of the Boingo brand or make other decisions that do not promote and maintain the Boingo brand, such as our custom branding alternatives that we offer to wholesale clients. If we fail to promote and maintain the Boingo brand, or if we incur significant expenses to promote the brand and are still unsuccessful in maintaining a strong brand, our financial condition and operating results could be harmed.\nAdditionally, we believe that developing this brand in a cost-effective manner is important in meeting our expected margins. Brand promotion activities may not result in increased revenue, and any increased revenue resulting from these promotion activities may not offset the expenses we incurred in building our brand. If we fail to cost effectively build and maintain our brand, we may fail to attract or retain customers or partners, and our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nThe growth of free Wi-Fi networks may compete with our paid mobile Wi-Fi Internet solutions.\nMany venues offer free mobile Wi-Fi as an incentive or value-added benefit to their customers. Free Wi-Fi may reduce retail customer demand for our services and put downward pressure on the prices we charge our retail customers. In addition, telecom operators may offer free mobile Wi-Fi as part of a home broadband or other service contract, which also may force down the prices we charge our retail customers. If we are unable to effectively offset this downward pressure on our prices by being a Wi-Fi service provider or sufficiently grow our DAS, tower, and small cell business, or if we are unable to acquire and retain retail customers, we will have lower profit margins and our operating results and financial condition may be adversely impacted.\nWe rely on third party customer support service providers for the majority of our customer support calls. If these service providers experience operational difficulties or disruptions, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe depend on third party customer support service providers to handle most of our routine Multifamily, Military and Legacy retail customer support cases. While we maintain limited customer support operations through a largely remote workforce, if our relationships with our customer support service providers terminate unexpectedly, or if our customer service teams experience operational difficulties, we may not be able to respond to customer support calls in a timely manner and the quality of our customer service would be adversely affected. This could harm our reputation and brand image and make it difficult for us to attract and retain users. In addition, the loss of our customer support service providers would require us to identify and contract with alternative sources, which could prove time-consuming and expensive.\nIf we are not successful in developing our mobile application for new devices and platforms, or if those solutions are not widely adopted, our results of operations and business could be adversely affected.\nAs new mobile devices and platforms are developed, we may encounter problems in developing products for such new mobile devices and platforms, and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation, support, and maintenance of such products. In addition, if we experience difficulties integrating our mobile applications into mobile devices, or if we face increased costs to distribute our mobile applications, our future growth and our results of operations could suffer.\nIf we fail to maintain relationships with providers of mobile operating systems or mobile application download stores, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on the integration of our software into mobile operating systems to allow mobile devices to connect to our global network of wireless networks. If problems arise with our relationships with providers of mobile operating systems or mobile application download stores, such as the Apple App Store and Google Play, or if our mobile application receives unfavorable treatment compared to the promotion and placement of competing applications, such\nas the order of our products in the mobile application download stores, we may fail to attract or retain customers or partners, and our business could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to our Software, Data Protection and Cybersecurity\nWe process, store, transfer and use personally identifiable information, confidential information and other data, which subjects us to laws and regulations and other legal obligations, of which the actual or perceived failure to comply could adversely affect our business.\nWe process, store, transfer and use data from or about our certain of our customers, including certain personally identifiable information and confidential information. These activities subject, or may subject, us to various federal, state, local and international laws and regulations regarding data privacy, protection, and security. In addition, we are also subject to the terms of our privacy policies and other third-party obligations regarding data privacy, protection and security. Although we strive to comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies and other legal obligations, the regulatory framework for data privacy, protection and security is complex and ambiguous, and thus our current rules and practices may not, or allegedly may not, be complaint. Such noncompliance or alleged noncompliance could increase our costs and require us to modify our services and products, possibly in a material manner, and could limit or prevent us from processing, storing, transferring or using certain customer data in our services and products.\nIn addition, data privacy, protection and security laws, regulations and industry standards are constantly evolving and being adopted in various jurisdictions. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) became effective May 2018, superseding existing European Union data protection legislation. Additionally, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) was passed in June 2018 and became effective January 2020. The GDPR and CCPA both provide certain data subjects with new data privacy rights, compel new operational requirements for companies, and impose potentially significant penalties for noncompliance. The cost to comply with the GDPR, CCPA and other new laws, regulations and industry standards, including costs associated with any related governmental investigations, enforcement actions, or litigations or claims, may limit the use and adoption of our products and services and could have an adverse impact on our business.\nAdvances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other cyber-security developments may result in a compromise or breach of the technology we use to protect user transaction data and cyber-security attacks are becoming more sophisticated. Cyber-security risks such as malicious software and attempts to gain unauthorized access to data are rapidly evolving and could lead to disruptions in our network, unauthorized release of personally identifiable, confidential or otherwise protected information or corruption of data. Any compromises of our security could damage our reputation and brand and expose us to possible liability such as litigation claims or fines, which would substantially harm our business and operating results. We have incurred costs and may need to expend significant additional resources to appropriately protect against security breaches, implement processes to adequately respond to security breaches (including as may be required by applicable law, such as the GDPR), or to address problems caused by breaches.\nMany countries, such as European Union member countries as a result of the 2006 E.U. Data Retention Directive, are introducing, or have already introduced into local law some form of traffic and user data retention requirements, which are generally applicable to providers of electronic communications services. Retention periods and data types vary from country to country, and the various local data protection and other authorities may implement traffic and user retention requirements regarding certain data in different and potentially overlapping ways. Although the constitutionality of the 2006 E.U. Data Retention Directive has been questioned, we may be required to comply with data retention requirements in one or more jurisdictions, or we may be required to comply with these requirements in the future as a result of changes or modifications to the Boingo solution or changes or modifications to the technological infrastructure on which the Boingo solution is based. Failure to comply with these retention requirements may result in the imposition of costly penalties. Compliance with these retention requirements can be difficult and costly from a legal, operational and technical perspective and could harm our business and operational results.\nVarious events could disrupt our networks, information systems or properties and could impair our operating activities and negatively impact our reputation and financial results.\nNetwork and information systems technologies are critical to our operating activities, both for our internal uses and supplying services to our customers. Network or information system shutdowns or other service failure disruptions, such as access point failure at one of our managed and operated wireless infrastructure networks or a backhaul disruption, caused by events such as computer hacking, dissemination of computer viruses, worms and other destructive or disruptive software, \u201ccyber-attacks,\u201d process breakdowns, denial of service attacks and other malicious activity pose increasing risks. Both unsuccessful and successful \u201ccyber-attacks\u201d on companies have continued to increase in frequency, scope and potential harm in recent years. While we develop and maintain systems seeking to prevent systems-related events and security breaches from occurring, the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as techniques used in such attacks become more sophisticated and change frequently. We, and the third parties on which we rely, may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. While from time-to-time attempts have been made to access our network, these attempts have not yet resulted in any material release of information, degradation or disruption to our network and information systems. We maintain cyber liability insurance; however, this insurance may be insufficient to cover the financial, legal, business, or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our systems.\nOur network and information systems are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunications failures, accidents, natural disasters (including extreme weather arising from short-term or any long-term changes in weather patterns), terrorist attacks and similar events. Further, the impacts associated with extreme weather or long-term changes in weather patterns, such as increased and intensified storm activity, may cause increased business interruptions. Our system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and our disaster recovery planning may be insufficient for all eventualities.\nAny of these events, if directed at, or experienced by, us or technologies upon which we depend, could have adverse consequences on our network, our customers and our business, including damage to our or our customers\u2019 equipment and data and could result in lengthy interruptions in the availability of the Boingo solution. Large expenditures may be necessary to repair or replace damaged property, networks or information systems or to protect them from similar events in the future. Moreover, the amount and scope of insurance, if any, that we maintain against losses resulting from any such events or security breaches may not be sufficient to cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for any disruptions to our business that may result. Any such significant service disruption could result in damage to our reputation, brand and credibility, customer dissatisfaction and ultimately a loss of customers or revenue. Any significant loss of customers or revenue, significant increase in costs of serving those customers, or damage to our reputation, brand or credibility could adversely affect our growth, financial condition and results of operations.\nMaterial defects or errors in our software could harm our reputation and brand, result in significant costs to us and impair our ability to sell the Boingo solution.\nThe software underlying the Boingo solution is inherently complex and may contain material defects or errors, particularly when the software is first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. We have from time to time found defects or errors in our software, and defects or errors in our existing software may be detected in the future. Any defects or errors that cause interruptions to the availability of our services could result in:\n\u25cf a reduction in sales or delay in market acceptance of the Boingo solution;\n\u25cf sales credits or refunds to our users and wholesale partners;\n\u25cf loss of existing users and difficulty in attracting new users;\n\u25cf diversion of development resources;\n\u25cf harm to our reputation and brand image; and\n\u25cf increased insurance costs.\nThe costs incurred in correcting any material defects or errors in our software may be substantial and could harm our operating results.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nClaims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology could harm our business.\nIn recent years there has been significant litigation involving intellectual property rights in many technology-based industries, including the wireless communications industry. While we have not been specifically targeted, similar companies have been subject to patent lawsuits. As we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly high profile, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us grows. We may be subject to third party claims in the future. The costs of supporting these litigations and disputes are considerable, and there can be no assurance that a favorable outcome will be obtained. We may be required to settle these litigations and disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us, given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. Claims that the Boingo solution infringes third party intellectual property rights, regardless of their merit or resolution, could also divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. The terms of any settlements or judgments may require us to:\n\u25cf cease distribution and back-end operation of the Boingo solution;\n\u25cf pay substantial damages for infringement;\n\u25cf expend significant resources to develop non-infringing solutions;\n\u25cf license technology from the third-party claiming infringement, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all;\n\u25cf cross-license our technology to a competitor to resolve an infringement claim, which could weaken our ability to compete with that competitor; or\n\u25cf pay substantial damages to our partners to discontinue their use of or to replace infringing solutions sold to them with non-infringing solutions.\nAny of these unfavorable outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe utilize unlicensed spectrum in certain of our offerings, which is subject to intense competition, low barriers of entry and slowdowns due to multiple users.\nWe presently utilize unlicensed spectrum to provide our Wi-Fi Internet solutions. Unlicensed or \u201cfree\u201d spectrum is available to multiple users and may suffer bandwidth limitations, interference and slowdowns if the number of users exceeds traffic capacity. The availability of unlicensed spectrum is not unlimited, and others do not need to obtain permits or licenses to utilize the same unlicensed spectrum that we currently, or may in the future, utilize. The inherent limitations of unlicensed spectrum could potentially threaten our ability to reliably deliver our services. Moreover, the prevalence of unlicensed spectrum creates low barriers to entry in our industry.\nOur use of open source software could limit our ability to commercialize the Boingo solution.\nWe have incorporated open source software into the Boingo solution. Although we closely monitor our use of open source software, we are subject to the terms of open source licenses that have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and there is a risk that in the future these licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize the Boingo solution. In that event, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties or to re-engineer our software in order to continue offering the Boingo solution, or to discontinue operations, any of which could materially adversely affect our business.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could be harmed, or we could be required to incur significant expenses to enforce our rights.\nOur business depends on our ability to protect our proprietary technology. We rely on trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws and confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties, all of which offer only limited protection. We own patents in the United States, Japan and China. Despite our efforts, the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent the use or misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights. Our ability to police the use, misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property is uncertain, particularly in countries other than the United States. Moreover, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with complete proprietary protection or any\ncompetitive advantages, and, as with any technology, competitors may be able to develop similar or superior technologies on their own now or in the future. Protecting against the unauthorized use of our solutions, trademarks, and other proprietary rights is expensive, difficult and, in some cases, impossible. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources, either of which could harm our business. Furthermore, many of our current and potential competitors can dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights than we do. Accordingly, despite our efforts, if the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third parties, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished and competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations. Any of these events would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Convertible Notes\nWe have incurred substantial indebtedness that may decrease our business flexibility, access to capital, and/or increase our borrowing costs, and we may still incur substantially more debt, which may adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nIn October 2018, we issued $201.25 million aggregate principal amount of 1.00% convertible senior notes due 2023 (\u201cConvertible Notes\u201d). Our indebtedness may:\n\u25cf limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;\n\u25cf limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;\n\u25cf require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments;\n\u25cf limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;\n\u25cf place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and\n\u25cf increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions.\nFurther, the indenture governing the Convertible Notes does not restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness and we and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in any future debt instruments existing at the time, some of which may be secured indebtedness.\nServicing our debt will require a significant amount of cash. We may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt, and we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the Convertible Notes in cash or to repurchase the Convertible Notes upon a fundamental change, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness, including the amounts payable under the Convertible Notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate enough cash flow from operations in the future to service our indebtedness and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt, or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nFurther, in connection with the Merger, holders of the Convertible Notes have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their Convertible Notes upon the occurrence of a \u201cfundamental change\u201d (as defined in the indenture governing the Convertible Notes (the \u201cindenture\u201d) and which includes the Merger) before the maturity date at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the Convertible Notes being converted.\nHowever, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of Convertible Notes surrendered therefor or pay cash with respect to Convertible Notes being converted.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes, if triggered, could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes is triggered, holders of the Convertible Notes will be entitled to convert their Convertible Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Convertible Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation in cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity.\nIn addition, even if holders of Convertible Notes do not elect to convert their Convertible Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Convertible Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the Convertible Notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nUnder Accounting Standards Codification 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (\u201cASC 470-20\u201d), an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments (such as the Convertible Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer\u2019s economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the Convertible Notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders\u2019 equity on our consolidated balance sheet at the issuance date and the value of the equity component would be treated as debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the Convertible Notes. As a result, we will be required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the Convertible Notes to their face amount over the term of the Convertible Notes. We will report larger net losses (or lower net income) in our financial results because ASC 470-20 will require interest to include both the amortization of the debt discount and the instrument\u2019s non-convertible coupon interest rate.\nIn addition, under certain circumstances, convertible debt instruments (such as the Convertible Notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cash may be accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of such Convertible Notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of such Convertible Notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued.\nEffective January 1, 2021, the Company expects to adopt the provisions of Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity\u2019s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40), which eliminates the beneficial conversion and cash conversion accounting models for convertible instruments, amends the accounting for certain contracts in an entity\u2019s own equity that are currently accounted for as derivatives because of specific settlement provisions, and modifies how particular convertible instruments and certain contracts that may be settled in cash or shares impact the diluted EPS calculation. Adoption of ASU 2020-06 under the modified retrospective method will result in the following: (i) reclassification of the equity component of our Convertible Notes related to the cash conversion feature to a liability thereby eliminating the debt discount; (ii) reclassification of debt issuance costs for the equity component of our Convertible Notes to a liability; (iii) adjustment of the amount of interest expense capitalized as part of our property and equipment; and (iv) calculation of the dilutive effect of the Convertible Notes on our diluted EPS using the if-converted method. The adoption of ASU 2020-06 is expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Refer to Footnote 2 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nThe capped call transactions may affect the value of the Convertible Notes and our common stock.\nIn connection with the pricing the Convertible Notes and exercise of the over-allotment option to purchase additional Convertible Notes, we entered into capped call transactions with a financial institution. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution upon conversion of the Convertible Notes and/or\noffset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Convertible Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap.\nIn connection with establishing its initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the financial institution or its affiliate likely purchased shares of our common stock and/or entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the Convertible Notes. The financial institution or its affiliate may modify its hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the Convertible Notes and prior to the maturity of the Convertible Notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of Convertible Notes). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the Convertible Notes.\nThe potential effect, if any, of these transactions and activities on the price of our common stock or the Convertible Notes will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time. Any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nAny conversion of the Convertible Notes, if triggered, would dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders, including holders who had previously converted their Convertible Notes, or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock.\nThe conversion of some or all of the Convertible Notes, if triggered, would dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares of our common stock upon conversion of any of the Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes are currently convertible and may from time to time in the future be convertible at the option of their holders prior to their scheduled terms under certain circumstances. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the Convertible Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Convertible Notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of the Convertible Notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile, which could result in substantial losses for investors.\nFluctuations in market price and volume are particularly common among securities of technology companies. As a result, you may be unable to sell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid. The market price of our common stock and trading price of our Convertible Notes may fluctuate significantly in response to the factors described in this risk factor section as well as the following factors, among others, many of which are beyond our control:\n\u25cf whether the Merger is consummated;\n\u25cf the status of relationships with our venue partner or the military;\n\u25cf decrease in demand for our DAS, tower, and small cell networks;\n\u25cf general market conditions;\n\u25cf the impact of COVID-19;\n\u25cf domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u25cf changes in or failure to meet publicly disclosed expectations as to our future financial performance;\n\u25cf changes in the regulatory environment related to our business, including exclusive arrangements;\n\u25cf changes in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial performance or lack of research and reports by industry analysts;\n\u25cf changes in market valuations or earnings of similar companies;\n\u25cf developments or disputes concerning patents or proprietary rights, including increases or decreases in litigation expenses associated with intellectual property lawsuits we may initiate, or in which we may be named as\ndefendants;\n\u25cf failure to complete significant sales;\n\u25cf any future sales of our common stock or other securities; and\n\u25cf additions or departures of key personnel.\nIf securities or industry analysts publish misleading or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock and our Convertible Notes depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts downgrades our stock or publishes misleading or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and the trading price of our Convertible Notes would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price or the trading price of our Convertible Notes or trading volume to decline. Announcements by analysts that may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock and the trading price of our Convertible Notes may relate to:\n\u25cf our operating results or forecasts;\n\u25cf new issuances of equity, debt or convertible debt by us;\n\u25cf developments in our relationships with corporate customers;\n\u25cf announcements by our customers or competitors;\n\u25cf changes in regulatory policy or interpretation;\n\u25cf governmental investigations;\n\u25cf changes in the industries in which we operate;\n\u25cf changes in the ratings of our stock by rating agencies or securities analysts;\n\u25cf our acquisitions of complementary businesses; or\n\u25cf our operational performance.\nAs a public company, we are subject to financial and other reporting and corporate governance requirements that may be difficult for us to satisfy and may divert resources and management attention from operating our business.\nWe are required to file annual, quarterly and other reports with the SEC. We must prepare and timely file financial statements that comply with SEC reporting requirements. We are also subject to other reporting and corporate governance requirements, under the listing standards of the Nasdaq Stock Market, or Nasdaq, which imposes significant compliance obligations upon us. We are required, among other things, to:\n\u25cf prepare and file periodic reports, and distribute other stockholder communications, in compliance with the federal securities laws and Nasdaq rules; and\n\u25cf evaluate and maintain our system of internal control over financial reporting, and report on management\u2019s assessment thereof, in compliance with rules and regulations of the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. Further, we are required to obtain an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31st each year from our independent registered public accounting firm.\nIf we fail to comply with the rules of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 related to accounting controls and procedures, or, if we discover material weaknesses and deficiencies in our internal control and accounting procedures, our financial results may be adversely affected and we may be subject to sanctions by regulatory authorities and our stock price and the trading price of our Convertible Notes could decline.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (the \u201cAct\u201d) requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and requires an attestation and report by our external auditing firm on our internal control over financial reporting. We believe our system and process evaluation and testing comply with the management certification and auditor attestation requirements of Section 404. We cannot be certain, however, that we\nwill be able to satisfy the requirements in Section 404 in all future periods, especially as we grow our business. If we are not able to continue to meet the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or with adequate compliance, we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC or the Nasdaq Stock Market. Any such action could adversely affect our financial results or investors\u2019 confidence in us and could cause our stock price and the trading price of our Convertible Notes to fall. Moreover, if we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal controls that are deemed to be material weaknesses, we may be required to incur significant additional financial and management resources to achieve compliance.\nIf we need additional capital in the future, it may not be available on favorable terms, or at all.\nWe may require additional capital from equity or debt financing in the future to fund our operations or respond to competitive pressures or strategic opportunities. We may not be able to secure timely additional financing on favorable terms, or at all. The terms of additional financing may place limits on our financial and operating flexibility. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity, convertible debt securities or other securities convertible into equity, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership of our company, and any new securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, if and when we require it, our ability to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges and opportunities could be significantly limited.\nInvestors may experience dilution of their ownership interests because of the future issuance of additional shares of our capital stock.\nWe are authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of common stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock. As of December 31, 2020, there were approximately 44,631,000 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding and no shares of preferred stock outstanding. In addition, as of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 951,000 unvested restricted stock units, approximately 109,000 exercisable stock options, approximately 1,382,000 shares available for grant under the 2011 Plan, and approximately 4,756,000 shares subject to conversion under the Convertible Notes.\nIn the future, we may issue additional authorized but previously unissued equity securities resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of our present stockholders. We may also issue additional shares of our capital stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for our capital stock in connection with hiring or retaining employees or for other business purposes, including future sales of our securities for capital raising purposes. The future issuance of any such additional shares of capital stock may create downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock and our Convertible Notes.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law and provisions in the indenture for our Convertible Notes could discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock.\nWe are a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable. Institutional shareholder representative groups, shareholder activists and others may disagree with our corporate governance provisions or other practices, such as those listed below. We generally will consider recommendations of institutional shareholder representative groups, but we will make decisions based on what our board and management believe to be in the best long-term interests of our company and stockholders. These groups could make recommendations to our stockholders against our practices or our board members if they disagree with our positions. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions that:\n\u25cf authorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u25cf provide that vacancies on the board of directors, including newly-created directorships, may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office;\n\u25cf limit who may call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u25cf prohibit stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders; and\n\u25cf require supermajority stockholder voting to effect certain amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws.\nIn addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. These provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time.\nIn addition, if a fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date of the Convertible Notes, holders of the Convertible Notes will have the right, at their option, to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their Convertible Notes. If a \u201cmake-whole fundamental change\u201d (as defined in the indenture) occurs prior to the maturity date, we will in some cases be required to increase the conversion rate of the Convertible Notes for a holder that elects to convert its Convertible Notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change. Furthermore, the indenture prohibits us from engaging in certain mergers or acquisitions unless, among other things, the surviving entity assumes our obligations under the Convertible Notes.\nThese and other provisions in our charter documents, Convertible Notes, indenture and in Delaware law could deter or prevent a third party from acquiring us or could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirors to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by our then-current board of directors, including to delay or impede a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest involving our company. The existence of these provisions could negatively affect the price of our common stock and the trading price of the Convertible Notes and limit opportunities for you to realize value in a corporate transaction.\nWe have incurred substantial losses in past and current years and may incur additional losses in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our accumulated deficit was $158.1 million. We generated a net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 and we are also currently investing in our future growth through expanding our network and buildouts, investing in our software, and consideration of future business acquisitions. As a result, we will incur higher depreciation and other operating expenses, as well as potential acquisition costs, that may negatively impact our ability to achieve profitability in future periods unless and until these growth efforts generate enough revenue to exceed their operating costs and cover our additional overhead needed to scale our business for this anticipated growth. The current global financial condition may also impact our ability to achieve profitability if we generate insufficient revenue to offset the increased costs. In addition, costs associated with the acquisition and integration of any acquired companies may also negatively impact our ability to achieve profitability. For example, in August 2018 we closed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Elauwit and our integration costs may negatively impact our ability to achieve profitability. Finally, given the competitive and evolving nature of the industry in which we operate, we may not be able to achieve or increase profitability.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe do not intend to declare and pay dividends on our capital stock for the foreseeable future. We currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth. Therefore, you are not likely to receive any dividends on your common stock for the foreseeable future and the success of an investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in its value.\nChanges in accounting standards and their interpretations could adversely affect our operating results.\nU.S. GAAP are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\"), the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (\u201cPCAOB\u201d), the SEC, and various other bodies that promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. These principles and related implementation guidelines and interpretations can be highly complex and involve subjective judgments. A change in these principles or interpretations, including the impact of the adoption of ASU 2020-06 under the modified retrospective method for the accounting for the Convertible Notes effective January 1, 2021, could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before or after the announcement of a change. Additionally, the adoption of these standards may potentially require enhancements or changes in our systems and will require significant time and cost on behalf of our financial management. A discussion of these standards and other pending\nchanges in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, are further discussed in Footnote 2 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.", "PERMNO": 12798, "SIC": 4899, "TIC": "WIFI"}
