{"cik": "1159281", "company": "FIVE STAR SENIOR LIVING INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Investors and prospective investors should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks described below may not be the only risks we face, but are risks we believe may be material at this time. Additional risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently think are immaterial, may also impair our business operations or financial results. If any of the events or circumstances described below occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations and the value of our securities could decline. Investors and prospective investors should consider the following risks, the information contained under the heading \u201cWarning Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and the risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before deciding whether to invest in our securities.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe and DHC restructured our business arrangements to address financial and operating challenges we had been experiencing, but those arrangements may not result in the benefits we expect.\nOn January 1, 2020, we and DHC completed the Restructuring Transactions to address financial and operating challenges we had been experiencing under the challenging conditions in the senior living industry that had been existing and continue to exist. In connection with the Restructuring Transactions, among other things, all of the senior living communities that DHC owns and that we previously leased and operated are now operated by us pursuant to long-term management agreements.\nAs a result of this change, our operating leverage has been reduced significantly because we are no longer paying rent to DHC for the senior living communities we previously leased but now manage for the account of DHC as of January 1, 2020. We believe these changes will enable us to be profitable in the future. However, our business remains subject to various risks, including, among others, the highly competitive nature of the senior living industry; medical advances and health and wellness services that allow some potential residents to defer the time when they require the special services available at our senior living communities; low unemployment in the United States combined with a competitive labor market within our industry that are increasing our employment costs, including labor costs that we incur and which DHC is not obligated to fund or reimburse to us; significant regulatory requirements imposed on our business; and other factors. Many of these factors are beyond our control. As a result, we may not achieve and maintain profitability in future periods, despite having completed the Restructuring Transactions.\nWe may fail to operate profitably, despite having completed the Restructuring Transactions.\nMost of the senior living communities we operate are owned by DHC and we operate those senior living communities pursuant to long-term management agreements. Pursuant to those management agreements, DHC funds the operations and capital needs of those senior living communities, which alleviates us of those funding commitments. In return, we receive management fees based on revenues, and construction costs for construction projects we manage, at those senior living communities. In addition, we may earn incentive fees if the combined earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, at those senior living communities exceed certain targets. We engage in other businesses besides managing senior living communities for DHC, including owning and leasing from other third parties senior living communities, as well as providing other services, such as rehabilitation, wellness and home health services. Further, we may grow these businesses or engage in new or additional businesses in the future. If we do not profitably operate our businesses, we may incur losses if the fees we earn from the senior living communities we manage for DHC do not exceed those losses. In addition, we incur other expenses that are not incurred at the senior living communities we manage for DHC, including corporate and general and administrative expenses, that we are responsible for funding. If those expenses exceed the fees we earn from the senior living communities we manage for DHC and any profits we may realize at our other businesses, we may incur operating losses.\nOur ability to grow our revenues may be limited, and a small percentage decline in our revenues or increase in our expenses could have a material adverse impact on our operating results.\nMost of the senior living communities we operate currently are pursuant to long-term management agreements. The base management and construction supervision fees we earn under those management agreements are based on a fixed percentage of revenues and construction costs for construction projects we manage at those senior living communities, which are currently 5% and 3%, respectively. As a result, our ability to grow our revenues from managing those senior living communities will be limited to the applicable fee percentages related to the growth of revenues or applicable construction costs from those senior living communities, subject to any incentive fees we may earn, which are capped at 1.5% of gross revenues realized at all communities on a combined basis in a calendar year. In addition, some of our costs are fixed or may not be able to, or may be delayed in being, proportionally adjusted in response to any decline in fees and other revenues we may experience. As a result, a small percentage decline in our revenues or increase in our expenses could have a material adverse impact on our operating results.\nOur ability to earn incentive fees and avoid triggering DHC termination rights will depend, in part, on our ability to grow EBITDA at our managed senior living communities.\nWe may earn incentive fees under the New Management Agreements with DHC if EBITDA from the managed senior living communities exceeds target levels. The EBITDA target levels are increased annually based on the greater of the yearly increase in the Consumer Price Index and 2%, plus a percentage of any capital costs we fund at our managed senior living communities in excess of target amounts. If the revenues from our managed senior living communities do not grow in excess of those increases, or if the expenses from our senior living communities grow in excess of those increases, we may not earn incentive fees, or any incentive fees we may earn may decrease. Further, DHC has certain termination rights if EBITDA from our managed senior living communities do not exceed target levels. As a result, if we fail to increase EBITDA at our managed senior living communities by the amount of the annual increases to the target levels, our business, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nCircumstances that adversely affect the ability of older adults or their families to pay for our services could cause our revenues and results of operations to decline.\nAs further discussed below, government benefits, such as Medicare and Medicaid, are not generally available for services at independent and assisted living communities. Many older adults are not otherwise able to pay our monthly resident fees with private resources. Our residents paid approximately 78.5% of the total resident fees in connection with the senior living communities we operated during the year ended December 31, 2019, from their private resources, and we expect to continue to rely on the ability of our residents to pay for our services from their own financial resources. Economic downturns, softness in the U.S. housing market, higher levels of unemployment among resident family members, lower levels of consumer confidence, stock market volatility and/or changes in demographics could adversely affect the ability of older adults to afford our resident fees. If we are unable to retain and/or attract older adults with sufficient income, assets or other resources required to pay the fees associated with independent and assisted living services and other service offerings, our revenues and results of operations could decline.\nThe current trend for older adults to delay moving to senior living communities until they require greater care or to forgo moving to senior living communities altogether could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOlder adults have been increasingly delaying moving to senior living communities, including to our senior living communities, until they require greater care, and they have been increasingly forgoing moving to senior living communities altogether. Further, rehabilitation services and other services are increasingly being provided to older adults on an outpatient basis or in older adults\u2019 personal residences in response to market demand and government regulation, which may increase the trend for older adults to delay moving to senior living communities. Such delays may cause decreases in our occupancy rates and increases in our resident turnover rates. Moreover, older adults may have greater care needs and require higher acuity services, which may increase our cost of doing business, expose us to additional liability or result in lost business and shorter stays at our senior living communities if we are not able to provide the requisite care services or fail to adequately provide those services. These trends may negatively impact our occupancy rates, revenues, cash flows and results of operations.\nIncreases in our labor costs and staffing turnover may have a material adverse effect on us.\nWages and employee benefits associated with our operations were approximately 43% of our 2019 total operating expenses. The U.S. labor market has been experiencing an extended period of low unemployment. Further, there has been recent legislation enacted and proposed legislation to increase the minimum wage in certain jurisdictions. This, in turn, has put upward pressure on wages. We compete with other senior living community operators, among others, to attract and retain qualified personnel responsible for the day-to-day operations of our senior living communities. The market for qualified nurses, therapists and other healthcare professionals is highly competitive, and periodic or geographic area shortages of such healthcare professionals may require us to increase the wages and benefits we offer to our employees in order to attract and retain such personnel or to utilize temporary personnel at an increased cost. In addition, employee benefit costs, including health insurance and workers\u2019 compensation insurance costs, have materially increased in recent years. Increasing employee health insurance and workers\u2019 compensation insurance costs and other employee benefits costs may materially and adversely affect our earnings.\nWe have been experiencing increases in labor costs. The low level of unemployment in the United States currently may result in our being unable to fully staff our senior living communities and clinics or having to pay overtime to adequately staff our senior living communities and clinics. Although, following completion of the Restructuring Transactions, we manage most of the senior living communities we operate and are not responsible for funding labor costs at those senior living communities, labor cost pressures impact the other senior living communities we own and lease, as well as our other businesses and corporate level activities. Further, increases in labor costs at our managed senior living communities may negatively impact our financial results at those managed senior living communities and hence reduce or prevent our earning incentive fees for our management of those senior living communities or give rise to a DHC right of termination of the applicable management agreements if the EBITDA at those managed senior living communities does not meet certain targets. We cannot be sure that our labor costs will not continue to increase or that any increases will be recovered by corresponding increases in the rates we charge to our residents or otherwise. Any significant failure by us to control labor costs or to pass any increases on to residents through rate increases could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, increased costs charged to our residents may reduce our occupancy and growth.\nWe often experience staffing turnover, which has recently increased in light of the current competitive labor market conditions and the competitive environment in the senior living industry. Heightened levels of staffing turnover, particularly for key and skilled positions, such as management, our regional and executive directors for our senior living communities and other skilled and qualified personnel, may disrupt our operations, limit or slow our ability to execute our business strategies, decrease our revenues and increase our costs, any of which may have a material adverse effect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe face significant competition.\nWe compete with numerous other senior living community operators, as well as companies that provide senior living services, such as home healthcare companies and other real estate based service providers. Some of our existing competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than us and some of our competitors are not for profit entities which have endowment income and may not face the same financial pressures that we do. We cannot be sure that we will be able to attract a sufficient number of residents to our senior living communities at rates that will generate acceptable returns or that we will be able to attract employees and keep wages and other employee benefits, insurance costs and other operating expenses at levels which will allow us to compete successfully and operate profitably.\nIn recent years, a significant number of new senior living communities have been developed and continue to be developed. Although there are indications that the rate of newly started developments has recently declined, the increased supply of senior living communities that has resulted from recent development activity has increased competitive pressures on us, particularly in certain geographic markets where we operate senior living communities, and we expect these competitive challenges to continue for the foreseeable future. These competitive challenges may prevent us from maintaining or improving occupancy and rates at our senior living communities, which may adversely affect their profitability and, therefore, negatively impact our revenues, cash flows and results from operations.\nIf we fail to identify and successfully act upon changes and trends in healthcare and the needs and preferences of older adults, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects will be adversely impacted.\nThe healthcare industry is a dynamic industry. The needs and preferences of older adults have generally changed over the past several years, including preferences to reside in their homes longer or permanently, as well as changes in services and offerings, including delivery of home healthcare services, utilization of outpatient rehabilitation services and services that address their increasing desire to maintain active lifestyles. If we fail to identify and successfully act upon and address changes\nand trends in healthcare and needs and preferences of older adults, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects will be adversely impacted.\nWe may fail to comply with the terms of our credit agreement.\nOur credit agreement includes various conditions, covenants and events of default. We may not be able to satisfy all of these conditions or may default on some of these covenants for various reasons, including for reasons beyond our control. For example, our credit agreement requires us to comply with certain financial and other covenants. Our ability to comply with such covenants will depend upon our ability to operate our business profitably. If the recent trends in occupancy, rates and employment and other costs and expenses continue or increase, we may incur operating losses. Complying with these covenants may limit our ability to take actions that may be beneficial to us and our securityholders.\nIf we default under our credit agreement, our lenders may demand immediate payment. Any default under our credit agreement that results in acceleration of our obligations to repay outstanding indebtedness would likely have serious adverse consequences to us, including the possible foreclosure of the real estate mortgages on 11 senior living communities owned by our guarantor subsidiaries, and would likely cause the value of our securities to decline.\nIn the future, we may obtain additional debt financing, and the covenants and conditions which apply to any such additional debt may be more restrictive than the covenants and conditions that are contained in our credit agreement.\nThe failure of Medicare and Medicaid rates to match our costs will reduce our income or create losses.\nSome of our current operations, especially our SNFs, receive significant revenues from Medicare and Medicaid. We derived approximately 21.5% and 23.3% of our total resident fees at the senior living communities we operated from these programs for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Payments under Medicare and Medicaid are set by government policy, laws and regulations. The rates and amounts of these payments are subject to periodic adjustment. Current and projected federal budget deficits, federal spending priorities and challenging state fiscal conditions have resulted in numerous recent legislative and regulatory actions or proposed actions with respect to Medicare and Medicaid payments, insurance and healthcare delivery. Examples of these, and other information regarding such matters and developments, are provided under the caption \u201cBusiness-Government Regulation and Reimbursement\u201d in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These matters could result in the failure of Medicare or Medicaid payment rates to cover our costs of providing required services to residents, or in reductions in payments to us or other circumstances that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPrivate third party payers continue to try to reduce healthcare costs.\nPrivate third party payers such as insurance companies continue their efforts to control healthcare costs through direct contracts with healthcare providers, increased utilization review practices and greater enrollment in managed care programs and preferred provider organizations. These third party payers increasingly demand discounted fee structures and the assumption by healthcare providers of all or a portion of the financial risk. These efforts to limit the amount of payments we receive for health and wellness services could adversely affect us. Reimbursement payments under third party payer programs may not remain at levels comparable to present levels or be sufficient to cover the costs allocable to patients participating in such programs. Future changes in, or renegotiations of, the reimbursement rates or methods of third party payers, or the implementation of other measures to reduce payments for our services could result in a substantial reduction in our net operating revenues. At the same time, as a result of competitive pressures, our ability to maintain operating margins through price increases to private pay residents may be limited.\nProvisions of the ACA and efforts to repeal, replace or modify the ACA could reduce our income and increase our costs.\nThe ACA contains insurance changes, payment changes and healthcare delivery systems changes that have affected, and will continue to affect our revenues and costs, subject to possible future repeal, replacement or modification of the ACA. The ACA provides for multiple reductions to the annual market updates for inflation that may result in reductions in SNF Medicare payment rates. In addition, certain provisions of the ACA that affect employers generally, including the employer shared responsibility provisions that went into effect on January 1, 2015, may have an impact on the design and cost of the health coverage that we offer to our employees. We are unable to predict the impact of the ACA on our future financial results of operations, but it may be adverse and material. In addition, maintaining compliance with the ACA will require us to expend management time and financial resources.\nThe ACA includes other changes that may affect us, such as enforcement reforms and Medicare and Medicaid program integrity control initiatives, new compliance, ethics and public disclosure requirements, initiatives to encourage the development of home and community based long-term care services rather than institutional services under Medicaid, value based purchasing plans and a Medicare post-acute care pilot program to develop and evaluate making a bundled payment for services, including physician and SNF services, provided during an episode of care. We are unable to predict the impact on us of the insurance, payment, and healthcare delivery systems reforms contained in and to be developed pursuant to the ACA. If the changes implemented under the ACA result in reduced payments for our services or the failure of Medicare, Medicaid or insurance payment rates to cover our increasing costs, our future financial results could be adversely and materially affected.\nDepressed U.S. housing market conditions may reduce the willingness or ability of older adults to relocate to our senior living communities.\nDownturns or stagnation in the U.S. housing market could adversely affect the ability, or perceived ability, of older adults to afford our entrance fees and resident fees, as prospective residents frequently use the proceeds from the sale of their homes to cover the cost of such fees. If older adults have a difficult time selling their homes, their ability to relocate to our senior living communities or finance their stays at our senior living communities with private resources could be adversely affected. If U.S. housing market conditions reduce older adults\u2019 willingness or ability to relocate to our senior living communities, the occupancy rates, revenues and cash flows at our senior living communities and our results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nFederal, state and local employment related laws and regulations could increase our cost of doing business, and our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to a variety of federal, state and local employment related laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs matters such as minimum wages, the Family and Medical Leave Act, overtime pay, compensable time, recordkeeping and other working conditions, and a variety of similar laws that govern these and other employment related matters. Because labor represents a significant portion of our operating expenses, compliance with these evolving laws and regulations could substantially increase our cost of doing business, while failure to do so could subject us to significant back pay awards, fines and lawsuits. Although following completion of the Restructuring Transactions, we manage most of the senior living communities we operate and are not responsible for funding labor costs at those senior living communities, labor cost pressures impact the other senior living communities we own and lease, as well as our other businesses and corporate level activities. Further, increases in labor costs at our managed senior living communities may negatively impact the financial results at those managed senior living communities and as a result, reduce or prevent our earning incentive fees for our management of those senior living communities or give rise to a DHC right of termination of the applicable management agreements if the EBITDA at those managed senior living communities does not meet certain targets. We are currently subject to employment related claims in connection with our operations. These claims, lawsuits and proceedings are in various stages of adjudication or investigation and involve a wide variety of claims and potential outcomes. Our failure to comply with federal, state and local employment related laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to extensive regulation, which requires us to incur significant costs and may result in losses.\nLicensing and Medicare and Medicaid laws require operators of senior living communities and rehabilitation and wellness clinics to comply with extensive standards governing operations and physical environments. Federal and state laws also prohibit fraud and abuse by senior living providers and rehabilitation and wellness clinic operators, including civil and criminal laws that prohibit false claims and regulate patient referrals in Medicare, Medicaid and other payer programs. In recent years, federal and state governments have devoted increased resources to monitoring the quality of care at senior living communities and to anti-fraud investigations in healthcare generally. CMS contractors are expanding the retroactive audits of Medicare claims submitted by SNFs and other providers, and recouping alleged overpayments for services determined by auditors not to have been medically necessary or not to meet Medicare coverage criteria as billed. State Medicaid programs and other third party payers are conducting similar medical necessity and compliance audits. When federal or state agencies identify violations of anti-fraud, false claims, anti-kickback and physician referral laws, they may impose or seek civil or criminal penalties, treble damages and other government sanctions, and may revoke a community\u2019s license or make conditional or exclude the community from Medicare or Medicaid participation. The ACA amended the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the FCA, making it easier for government agencies and private plaintiffs to prevail in lawsuits brought against healthcare providers, and for severe fines and penalties to be imposed on healthcare providers that violate applicable laws and regulations. In addition, when these agencies determine that there has been quality of care deficiencies or improper billing, they may impose or seek various remedies or sanctions, including denial of new admissions, exclusion from Medicare or Medicaid\nprogram participation, monetary penalties, restitution of overpayments, government oversight, temporary management, loss of licensure and criminal penalties.\nCurrent state laws and regulations allow enforcement officials to make determinations as to whether the care provided at our communities exceeds the level of care for which a particular community is licensed. A finding that a community is delivering care beyond the scope of its license could result in closure of the facility and the immediate discharge and transfer of residents. Certain states and the federal government may determine that citations relating to one community affect other communities operated by the same entity or related entities, which may negatively impact an operator\u2019s ability to maintain or renew other licenses or Medicare or Medicaid certifications or to secure new licenses or certifications. In addition, revocation of a license or certification at one community could impact our ability to obtain new licenses or certifications or to maintain or renew existing licenses and certifications at other communities, and trigger defaults under our management agreements with DHC, our leases and our credit agreement, or adversely affect our ability to operate or obtain financing in the future.\nOur communities incur sanctions and penalties from time to time. As a result of the healthcare industry\u2019s extensive regulatory system and increasing enforcement initiatives, we have experienced increased costs for monitoring quality of care compliance, billing procedures and compliance with referral laws and other laws that apply to us, and we expect these costs may continue to increase. For example, as disclosed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as a result of our compliance program initiative to review records related to our Medicare billing practices, in September 2017, we made a disclosure to the OIG regarding potential inadequate documentation and other potential issues at one of our leased SNFs. In June 2019, we settled this matter with the OIG without admitting any liability and agreed to pay approximately $1.1 million in exchange for a customary release. The compliance review we undertook, which resulted in this OIG voluntary disclosure, was not initiated in response to any specific complaint or allegation, but a review of the type that we periodically undertake to test our own compliance with applicable Medicare billing rules pursuant to our compliance program.\nThe revenues we receive from Medicare and Medicaid may be subject to statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive rate adjustments, recovery of program overpayments or set offs, administrative rulings and policy interpretations, and payment delays. If we become subject to additional regulatory sanctions or repayment obligations at any of our existing communities (or at any of our newly acquired communities with prior deficiencies that we are unable to correct or resolve), our business may be adversely affected, and we might experience financial losses. Any adverse determination concerning any of our licenses or eligibility for Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement or any penalties, repayments, or sanctions, and the increasing costs of required compliance with applicable federal and state laws, may adversely affect our ability to meet our financial obligations and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe nature of our business exposes us to litigation and regulatory and government proceedings.\nWe have been, are currently, and expect in the future to be, involved in claims, lawsuits and regulatory and government audits, investigations and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business, some of which may involve material amounts. The defense and resolution of such claims, lawsuits and other proceedings may require us to incur significant expenses.\nIn several well publicized instances, private litigation by residents of senior living communities for alleged abuses has resulted in large damage awards against other senior living companies. Some lawyers and law firms specialize in bringing litigation against senior living community operators. As a result of this litigation and potential litigation, the cost of our liability insurance continues to increase. Medical liability insurance reform has at times been a topic of political debate, and some states have enacted legislation to limit future liability awards. However, such reforms have not generally been adopted, and we expect our insurance costs may continue to increase. Further, although we determine our self-insurance reserves with guidance from third party professionals, our reserves may nonetheless be inadequate. Increasing liability insurance costs and increasing self-insurance reserves could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we are currently defendants in two employee litigation matters and may be subject to future employee litigation. For more information regarding the two pending employee litigation matters, see \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLitigation may subject us to adverse rulings and judgments that may materially impact our business, operating results and liquidity. In addition, defending litigation distracts the attention of our management and may be expensive. For more information regarding certain of our legal contingencies and past legal and compliance matters, see Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIf we do not achieve and maintain a high quality of care, payments through pay-for-performance and value-based purchasing programs may be reduced, and the overall attractiveness of our senior living communities to potential residents could decrease as more quality data becomes publicly available.\nCMS is moving towards pay-for-performance programs, such as value-based payment, as an alternative to fee-for-service reimbursement. In October 2016, CMS issued a final rule to implement the Quality Payment Program. Beginning in 2019, providers were subject to either MIPS payment adjustments or APM incentive payments. Under PAMA, since October 2018, Medicare payment rates are now partially based on SNFs\u2019 performance scores on a hospital readmission measure as part of CMS\u2019s new SNF Value-Based Purchasing Program. Moreover, under the IMPACT Act, SNFs are required to report certain quality measures, resource use measures and certain patient assessment data in a standardized and interoperable format. SNFs that fail to comply with the reporting requirements are subject to a 2.0% reduction in their Medicare payment rates. Since October 2018, HHS has made SNF-reported data publicly available on its Nursing Home Compare website. We cannot predict the impact of these quality-driven payment reforms, but they may be material to and adversely affect our future results of operations. In addition, we cannot predict the impact of more quality data becoming publicly available, but if we do not achieve and maintain a high quality of care, the overall attractiveness of our communities to potential residents could decrease.\nChanges in market interest rates, including changes that may result from the expected phase out of LIBOR, may adversely affect us.\nSince the most recent U.S. recession, the Board of Governors of the U.S. Federal Reserve System, or the U.S. Federal Reserve, has taken actions which have resulted in low interest rates prevailing in the marketplace for a historically long period of time. The U.S. Federal Reserve steadily increased the targeted federal funds rate over the last several years, but recently took action to decrease the federal funds rate and may continue to make adjustments in the near future. In addition, LIBOR is expected to be phased out in 2021. The interest rates under our revolving credit facility is based on LIBOR and future debt we may incur may also be based on LIBOR. We currently expect that the determination of interest under our revolving credit facility would be based on the alternative rates provided under our credit agreement or would be revised to provide for an interest rate that approximates the existing interest rate as calculated in accordance with LIBOR. Despite our current expectations, we cannot be sure that, if LIBOR is phased out or transitioned, the changes to the determination of interest under our credit agreement would approximate the current calculation in accordance with LIBOR. An alternative interest rate index that may replace LIBOR may result in our paying increased interest. Increases in market interest rates may materially and negatively affect us in several ways, including:\n\u2022\nincreases in interest rates could adversely impact the housing market and reduce demand for our services and occupancy at our senior living communities, could reduce the likelihood that we will earn incentive fees at our managed senior living communities if the EBITDA we realize at our managed senior living communities declines as a result; and could increase our rent expense at our leased senior living communities due to the landlord setting rent based on a required return on its investment;\n\u2022\namounts outstanding under our credit facility require interest to be paid at variable interest rates. When interest rates increase, our interest costs will increase, which could adversely affect our cash flows, our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt and our cost of refinancing our debt when it becomes due and our ability to fund our operations and working capital; and\n\u2022\nan increase in interest rates could decrease the amount buyers may be willing to pay for our senior living communities, thereby reducing the market value of our senior living communities and limiting our ability to sell senior living communities. Further, increased interest rates would increase our costs for, and may limit our ability to obtain, mortgage financing secured by our senior living communities.\nLow market interest rates, particularly if they remain over a sustained period, may increase our use of debt capital to fund property acquisitions, lower capitalization rates for property purchases and increased competition for property purchases, which may reduce our and, with respect to opportunities for us to operate additional communities owned by DHC, DHC\u2019s ability to acquire new properties.\nOur growth strategy may not succeed.\nWe intend to continue to grow our business by entering into additional long-term operating arrangements for senior living communities and growing the ancillary services we provide where residents\u2019 private resources account for all or a large majority of revenues. Our business plans include seeking to take advantage of expected long-term increases in demand for\nsenior living communities and health and wellness services. Our growth strategy is subject to risks, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nwe may not be an attractive business partner given our operating history and the liquidity challenges we have experienced;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to identify and operate additional senior living communities and clinics on acceptable terms;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to access the capital required to operate additional senior living communities and clinics or grow ancillary services;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to identify and operate additional senior living communities and clinics where residents\u2019 private resources account for all or a large majority of revenues;\n\u2022\nwe may not achieve the operating results we expect from newly managed senior living communities or any health and wellness or other services we may provide;\n\u2022\nthe operations of newly managed senior living communities and clinics and provision of other health and wellness services may subject us to unanticipated contingent liabilities or regulatory matters;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to make significant capital expenditures to improve newly managed senior living communities, including capital expenditures that were unanticipated at the time of entry into the management arrangements;\n\u2022\nwe may have difficulty hiring and retaining key employees and other personnel at newly managed senior living communities and clinics;\n\u2022\nit may take a period of time to stabilize the operations of newly managed senior living communities;\n\u2022\nintegrating the operations of newly managed senior living communities, clinics or other health and wellness services we may provide may disrupt our existing operations, or may cost more than anticipated;\n\u2022\nwe may fail to realize any expected operating or cost efficiencies from senior living communities or clinics we agree to manage;\n\u2022\nwe may agree to manage senior living communities subject to unknown liabilities and without any recourse, or with limited recourse, such as liability for the cleanup of undisclosed environmental contamination or for claims by residents, vendors or other persons related to actions taken by former owners or operators of the communities;\n\u2022\nany failure to comply with licensing requirements at our senior living communities, clinics or elsewhere may prevent our obtaining or renewing licenses needed to conduct and grow our businesses; and\n\u2022\nnewly managed senior living communities, clinics and other new or expanded health and wellness services we may seek to provide might require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our other business activities.\nFor these reasons, among others, we might not realize the anticipated benefits of our additional long-term operating arrangements, and our growth strategy may not succeed or may cause us to experience losses.\nOur business requires us to make significant capital expenditures to maintain and improve our senior living communities.\nOur senior living communities sometimes require significant expenditures to address required ongoing maintenance or to make them more attractive to residents. Physical characteristics of senior living communities are mandated by various government authorities; changes in these regulations may require us to make significant expenditures. In addition, we are often required to make significant capital expenditures when we acquire or lease or manage new senior living communities. Our available financial resources may be insufficient to fund these expenditures. Although, following completion of the Restructuring Transactions, we manage most of the senior living communities we operate and we are not responsible for funding capital costs at those senior living communities, we still will incur capital costs for the senior living communities we own and lease, as well as for our other businesses and corporate level activities. Further, increases in capital costs at our\nmanaged senior living communities may negatively impact the financial results at those managed senior living communities and, if DHC funds capital costs above target amounts, the target EBITDA for the applicable senior living communities would be increased by an amount equal to six percent of the excess. Our earning incentive fees, and certain DHC rights to terminate our management agreements, are based on EBITDA generated at our managed senior living communities compared to EBITDA targets. Hence, increased capital costs at our managed senior living communities may reduce or prevent our earning incentive fees for our management of those senior living communities or give rise to a DHC right of termination of the applicable management agreements if the EBITDA at those managed senior living communities does not meet certain targets.\nWe rely on information technology and systems in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology or those systems could materially and adversely affect us.\nWe rely on information technology and systems, including the Internet and cloud-based infrastructures, commercially available software and our internally developed applications, to process, transmit, store and safeguard information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes (including managing our building systems), including financial transactions and maintenance of records, which may include personally identifiable information or protected health information of employees, residents and tenants and lease data. If we experience material security or other failures, inadequacies or interruptions of our information technology, we could incur material costs and losses and our operations could be disrupted as a result. Further, third party vendors could experience similar events with respect to their information technology and systems that impact the products and services they provide to us. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring, as well as our internally developed applications and internal procedures and personnel, to provide security for processing, transmitting, storing and safeguarding confidential employee, resident, tenant, customer and vendor information, such as personally identifiable information related to our employees and others, including our residents, and information regarding their and our financial accounts. We take various actions, and incur significant costs, to maintain and protect the operation and security of our information technology and systems, including the data maintained in those systems. However, it is possible that these measures will not prevent the systems\u2019 improper functioning or a compromise in security, such as in the event of a cyber attack or the improper disclosure of confidential or protected information.\nSecurity breaches, computer viruses, attacks by hackers, online fraud schemes and similar breaches can create significant system disruptions, shutdowns, fraudulent transfer of assets or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. The cybersecurity risks to us and our third party vendors are heightened by, among other things, the evolving nature of the threats faced, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography and new and increasingly sophisticated methods used to perpetrate illegal or fraudulent activities against us, including cyberattacks, email or wire fraud and other attacks exploiting security vulnerabilities in our or third parties\u2019 information technology networks and systems or operations. Any failure to maintain the security, proper function and availability of our information technology and systems, or certain third party vendors\u2019 failure to similarly protect their information technology and systems that are relevant to us or our operations, or to safeguard our business processes, assets and information could result in financial losses, interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, cause us to be in default of material contracts and subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and the value of our securities.\nWe may fail to comply with laws governing the privacy and security of personal information, including relating to health.\nWe are required to comply with federal and state laws governing the privacy, security, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information and protected health information. Under HIPAA and the HITECH Act, as updated by the Omnibus Rule, we are required to comply with the HIPAA privacy rule, security standards and standards for electronic healthcare transactions. State laws also govern protected health information, and rules regarding state privacy rights may be more stringent than HIPAA. Other federal and state laws govern the privacy of other personally identifiable information. If we fail to comply with applicable federal or state standards, we could be subject to civil sanctions and criminal penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may incur significant costs from our self-insurance arrangements.\nWe partially self-insure up to certain limits for workers\u2019 compensation, professional and general liability and automobile coverage. Claims in excess of these limits are insured up to contractual limits, over which we are self-insured. We fully self-insure all health related claims for our covered employees. Although, following completion of the Restructuring Transactions, we manage most of the senior living communities we operate and are not responsible for funding insurance costs at those senior living communities, including health insurance for our employees who work at those senior living communities, these insurance cost pressures impact senior living communities we own and lease, as well as our other businesses and corporate level activities. Further, increases in insurance costs at our managed senior living communities may negatively impact the financial results at those managed senior living communities and, as a result, reduce or prevent our earning incentive\nfees for our management of those senior living communities or give rise to a DHC right of termination of the applicable management agreements if the EBITDA at those managed senior living communities does not meet certain targets. We may incur significant costs for claims and related matters under our self-insurance arrangements. We cannot be sure that our insurance charges and self-insurance reserve requirements will not increase, and we cannot predict the amount of any such increase, or to what extent, if at all, we may be able to offset any such increase through higher retention amounts, self-insurance or other means in the future. Although we determine our employee health insurance, workers\u2019 compensation and professional and general liability self-insurance reserves with guidance from third party professionals, our reserves may nonetheless be inadequate. Determining reserves for the casualty, liability, workers\u2019 compensation and healthcare losses and costs that we have incurred as of the end of a reporting period involves significant judgments based upon our experience and our expectations of future events, including projected settlements for pending claims, known incidents that we expect may result in claims, estimates of incurred but not yet reported claims, expected changes in premiums for insurance provided by insurers whose policies provide for retroactive adjustments, estimated litigation costs and other factors. Since these reserves are based on estimates, the actual expenses we incur may differ from the amount reserved and could result in our recognizing a significant amount of expenses in excess of our reserves. Our costs under our self-insurance arrangements may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and liquidity.\nInsurance may not adequately cover our losses, and the cost of obtaining such insurance may continue to increase.\nWe maintain insurance coverage for our properties and the operations conducted on them, including for casualty, liability, malpractice at managed properties, fire, extended coverage and rental or business interruption loss insurance. Pursuant to our management agreements with DHC, we are obligated to maintain insurance for the senior living communities that we manage for DHC\u2019s account. Recently, the costs of insurance have increased significantly, and these increased costs have had an adverse effect on us and the operating results for our senior living communities. Although DHC funds the insurance premiums for the managed senior living communities, the increased costs of insurance may negatively impact the financial results at those managed senior living communities and hence reduce or prevent our earning incentive fees for our management of those senior living communities or give rise to a DHC right of termination of the applicable management agreements if the EBITDA at those managed senior living communities does not meet certain targets. In addition, we are responsible for paying for insurance for other properties that we operate, including senior living communities that we own or lease, and increased insurance costs will adversely impact us as a result. Losses of a catastrophic nature, such as those caused by hurricanes, flooding, volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, among other things, or losses from terrorism, may be covered by insurance policies with limitations such as large deductibles or co-payments that we or, with respect to the properties that DHC owns and we manage, DHC may not be able to pay. Insurance proceeds may not be adequate to restore an affected property to its condition prior to a loss or to compensate us for our losses, including the loss of future revenues from an affected property. Similarly, our other insurance, including our general liability insurance, may not provide adequate insurance to cover our losses. In addition, we do not have any insurance to limit losses that we may incur as a result of known or unknown environmental conditions. Further, we cannot be sure that certain types of risks that are currently insurable will continue to be insurable on an economically feasible basis, and, in the future, we may discontinue certain insurance coverage on some or all of our properties that we own or are otherwise not obligated to maintain pursuant to agreements with third parties if the cost of premiums for any of these policies in our judgment exceeds the value of the coverage discounted for the loss. If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs, we may have to incur uninsured costs to mitigate such losses or lose all or a portion of the capital invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property. We might also remain obligated for any financial obligations related to the property, even if the property is irreparably damaged. In addition, future changes in the insurance industry\u2019s risk assessment approach and pricing structure could further increase the cost of insuring our properties or decrease the scope of insurance coverage, either of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nSuccessful union organization of our employees may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time labor unions attempt to organize our employees. If federal legislation modifies the labor laws to make it easier for employee groups to unionize, additional groups of employees may seek union representation. If our employees were to unionize, it could result in business interruptions, work stoppages, the degradation of service levels due to work rules, or increased operating expenses that may adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur geographic concentration of our senior living communities exposes us to changes in market conditions in those areas.\nWe have a high concentration of our senior living communities in various geographic areas, including in Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Texas and California. As a result of this concentration, the conditions of local economies and real estate markets, changes in governmental rules and regulations, particularly with respect to senior living communities, acts of nature and other factors that may result in a decrease in demand for our services in these states could have\nan adverse effect on our revenues, results of operations and cash flow. In addition, we are particularly susceptible to revenue loss, cost increases or damage caused by severe weather conditions or natural disasters such as hurricanes, wildfires, earthquakes or tornadoes in those areas.\nTermination of assisted living resident agreements and resident attrition could adversely affect our revenues and earnings.\nState regulations governing assisted living communities typically require a written resident agreement with each resident. Most of these regulations also require that each resident have the right to terminate these assisted living resident agreements for any reason on reasonable notice. Consistent with these regulations, most of our resident agreements allow residents to terminate their agreements on 30 days\u2019 notice. Thus, we may be unable to contract with assisted living residents to stay for longer periods of time, unlike typical apartment leasing arrangements that involve lease agreements with terms of up to a year or longer. If a large number of residents elected to terminate their resident agreements at or around the same time, our revenues and earnings could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, the advanced ages of our senior living residents may result in high resident turnover rates.\nWe are subject to limitations on our ability to use our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.\nWe expect that our ability to deduct pre-2020 net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards will be subject to a significant annual limitation on account of the ownership changes resulting from the Restructuring Transactions. The impact of the ownership change on our net operating losses and other tax credit carryforwards as a result of the completion of the Restructuring Transactions is described in Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Losses and credits that arise after the Conversion Time, which currently are expected to be utilized to offset future taxable income, will not be subject to the limitations resulting from the Restructuring Transactions, but future changes in ownership may result in limitations on usage or elimination of those future losses and credits. Our bylaws contain provisions to facilitate the preservation of the tax treatment of our net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards, including provisions generally prohibiting a person or group from becoming a \u201c5-percent shareholder\u201d (as defined in the applicable Treasury regulations) without the consent of our Board of Directors. However, we cannot be sure that these restrictions will be effective or that our Board of Directors will not determine to waive such restrictions in the future. Moreover, net operating losses and other carryforwards are subject to other limitations under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the IRC, including provisions generally restricting carryforwards of net operating losses arising in taxable years beginning after 2017 from offsetting more than 80% of the current year\u2019s taxable income, which could affect our ability to utilize all of our existing net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in a given year.\nOur operations are subject to environmental risks and liabilities.\nOur operations are required to comply with various environmental laws governing the use, management and disposal of, and human exposure to, hazardous and toxic substances. If we fail to comply with such laws, or if the properties we own, operate or use for disposal are contaminated by such substances, we may be subject to penalties or other corrective action requirements and liabilities, including the costs to investigate or remediate such contamination. These laws also expose us to claims by third parties for costs and damages they may incur in connection with hazardous substances related to our activities and properties. If we experience these environmental liabilities and costs, they could have a material impact on our operating results and financial condition.\nOur operations are subject to risks from adverse weather and climate events.\nSevere weather may have an adverse effect on certain senior living communities we operate. Flooding caused by rising sea levels and severe weather events, including hurricanes, tornadoes and widespread fires have had and may have in the future an adverse effect on senior living communities we operate and result in significant losses to us and interruption of our business. When major weather or climate-related events, such as hurricanes, floods and wildfires, occur near our senior living communities, we may relocate the residents at our senior living communities to alternative locations for their safety and close or limit the operations of the impacted senior living community until the event has ended and the senior living community is then ready for operation. We may incur significant costs and losses as a result of these activities, both in terms of operating, preparing and repairing our senior living communities in anticipation of, during and after a severe weather or climate-related event and in terms of potential lost business due to the interruption in operating our senior living communities. Our insurance may not adequately compensate us for these costs and losses.\nFurther, concerns about climate change have resulted in various treaties, laws and regulations that are intended to limit carbon emissions and address other environmental concerns. These and other laws may cause energy or other costs at our\nsenior living communities to increase. In the long-term, we believe any such increased operating costs will be passed through and paid by our residents and other customers in the form of higher charges for our services. However, in the short-term, these increased costs, if material in amount, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and cause the value of our securities to decline.\nA severe cold and flu season, epidemics or any other widespread illnesses could adversely affect the occupancy of our senior living communities.\nOur revenues are dependent on occupancy at our senior living communities. If there were to occur a severe cold and flu season, an epidemic or any other widespread illnesses, including the Coronavirus, in locations where our senior living communities are located, our revenues from those communities would likely be significantly adversely impacted. During such occasions, we may experience a decline in occupancy due to residents leaving our communities and, we may be required, or we may otherwise determine that it would be prudent, to quarantine some or all of the senior living community and not permit new residents during that time. Further, depending on the severity of the occurrence, we may be required to incur costs to identify, contain and remedy the impacts of those occurrences at those senior living communities. As a result, these occurrences could significantly adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur business could be adversely impacted if there are deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting.\nThe design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors, misstatements or misrepresentations. While management will continue to review the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting, we cannot be sure that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time. Deficiencies, including any material weaknesses, in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting could result in misstatements of our results of operations or our financial statements or could otherwise materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nRisks Arising From Certain of Our Relationships and Our Organization and Structure\nOur agreements and relationships with DHC, one of our Managing Directors, RMR LLC and others related to them may create conflicts of interest or the perception of such conflicts of interest.\nWe have significant commercial and other relationships with DHC, the Chair of our Board of Directors and one of our Managing Directors, Adam D. Portnoy, RMR LLC and others related to them, including:\n\u2022\nthe substantial majority of the senior living communities that we operate are owned by DHC and our business is substantially dependent upon our relationship with DHC;\n\u2022\nfollowing the completion of the Restructuring Transactions, DHC owned 33.9% of our outstanding common shares as of January 1, 2020;\n\u2022\nRMR LLC provides management services to us and DHC and we pay RMR LLC fees for those services based on a percentage of revenues, as defined under our business management agreement with RMR LLC. In the event of a conflict between us and DHC or us and RMR LLC, any of its affiliates or any public entity RMR LLC or its subsidiaries provide management services to, RMR LLC may act on its own and DHC\u2019s or such other entity\u2019s behalf rather than on our behalf;\n\u2022\nAdam Portnoy, is also the chair of the board of trustees and a managing trustee of DHC, is a managing director, an officer and employee and, as the sole trustee of ABP Trust, the controlling shareholder of RMR Inc., and is an officer of, and through ABP Trust owns equity interests in, RMR LLC. RMR Inc. is the managing member of RMR LLC;\n\u2022\nAdam Portnoy beneficially owned, following the completion of the Restructuring Transactions, in aggregate, approximately 6.3% of our outstanding common shares and 1.1% of DHC's outstanding common shares, in each case as of January 1, 2020;\n\u2022\nour President and Chief Executive Officer, Katherine E. Potter, and our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, Jeffrey C. Leer, are also officers and employees of RMR LLC, as are DHC\u2019s president and chief operating officer and chief financial officer and treasurer;\n\u2022\nour other Managing Director and Secretary, Jennifer B. Clark, is a managing trustee and secretary of DHC and a managing director and officer of RMR Inc. and an officer and employee of RMR LLC;\n\u2022\nprior to December 31, 2001, we were a wholly owned subsidiary of DHC. On that date, DHC distributed substantially all of our then outstanding common shares it owned to its shareholders. In connection with that distribution, we entered agreements with DHC and RMR LLC which, among other things, limit (subject to certain exceptions) ownership of more than 9.8% of our voting shares, restrict our ability to take any action that could jeopardize the tax status of DHC as a real estate investment trust and limit our ability to acquire real estate of types which are owned by DHC or other businesses managed by RMR LLC; and\n\u2022\nwe lease our office headquarters building from a subsidiary of ABP Trust.\nThese multiple responsibilities, relationships and cross ownerships could create competition for the time and efforts of RMR LLC, our Managing Directors and other RMR LLC personnel, including our executive officers, and give rise to conflicts of interest, or the perception of such conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving us, RMR Inc., RMR LLC, our Managing Directors, the other companies to which RMR LLC or its subsidiaries provide management services and their related parties. Conflicts of interest or the perception of conflicts of interest could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business and the market price of our common shares and other securities and we may be subject to increased risk of litigation as a result.\nAs a result of these relationships, the New Management Agreements, business management agreement with RMR LLC and other transactions with DHC, our Managing Director, RMR LLC and others related to them were not negotiated on an arm\u2019s-length basis between unrelated third parties, and therefore, while certain of these agreements were negotiated with the use of a special committee and approved by our disinterested directors, the terms thereof may not be as favorable to us as they would have been if they were negotiated on an arm\u2019s-length basis between unrelated third parties. In the past, in particular, following periods of volatility in the overall market or declines in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, stockholder litigation, dissident stockholder director nominations and dissident stockholder proposals have often been instituted against companies alleging conflicts of interest, in business dealings with affiliated and related persons and entities. These activities, if instituted against us, and the existence of conflicts of interest or the perception of conflicts of interest could result in substantial costs and diversion of our management\u2019s attention and could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business and the market price of our common shares.\nThe substantial majority of the senior living communities that we operate are owned by DHC and our business is substantially dependent on our relationship with DHC.\nOf the 268 senior living communities we operate, 244 are owned by DHC, and, as of January 1, 2020, we manage all of those senior living communities pursuant to the New Management Agreements.\nDHC may terminate the New Management Agreements in certain circumstances, including if the EBITDA we generate at our managed senior living communities does not exceed target levels or for our uncured material breach. Our business is substantially dependent upon our continued relationship with DHC. The loss of the New Management Agreements with DHC, or a material change to their terms, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nDHC owns 33.9% of our outstanding common shares. As a result, investors in our securities may have less influence over our business than shareholders of other publicly traded companies.\nAs of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, DHC owns 33.9% of our outstanding common shares.\nFor so long as DHC continues to retain a significant ownership stake in us, it may have a significant influence in the election of the members of our Board of Directors, including our Independent Directors, and the outcome of stockholder actions. As a result, DHC may have the ability to significantly impact all matters affecting us, including:\n\u2022\nthe composition of our Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nthrough our Board of Directors, determinations with respect to our management, business and investments generally, including with respect to our acquisition and disposition of assets, financing activities and plans, capital structure, distributions on our common shares, corporate policies and the appointment and removal of our officers, among others;\n\u2022\ndeterminations with respect to mergers and other business combinations; and\n\u2022\nthe number of common shares available for issuance under our equity compensation plan.\nIn addition, the significant ownership of DHC and Adam Portnoy and the entities controlled by him in us may discourage transactions involving a change of control of us, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their common shares over the then current market price.\nAs a result of the large ownership position of DHC, trading in our common shares may be more difficult.\nAs of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, DHC owns 33.9% of our outstanding common shares. This large shareholding reduces the number of our common shares that might otherwise be available to trade publicly, which could adversely affect the liquidity and market price of our common shares.\nOwnership limitations and certain provisions in our charter, bylaws and certain material agreements, as well as certain provisions of Maryland law, may deter, delay or prevent a change in our control or unsolicited acquisition proposals.\nOur charter and bylaws contain separate provisions which prohibit any stockholder from owning more than 9.8% and 5% of the number or value of any class or series of our outstanding shares of stock. The 9.8% ownership limitation in our charter is consistent with our contractual obligation with DHC to not take actions that may conflict with DHC\u2019s status as a real estate investment trust under the IRC. The 5% ownership limitation in our bylaws, or our NOL bylaw, is intended to help us preserve the tax treatment of any net operating losses and other tax benefits we may have from time to time. We also believe these provisions promote good orderly governance. These provisions inhibit acquisitions of a significant stake in us and may deter, delay or prevent a change in control of us or unsolicited acquisition proposals that a stockholder may consider favorable.\nOther provisions contained in our charter and bylaws or under Maryland law may also inhibit acquisitions of a significant stake in us and deter, delay or prevent a change in control of us or unsolicited acquisition proposals that a stockholder may consider favorable, including, for example, provisions relating to:\n\u2022\nthe division of our Directors into three classes, with the term of one class expiring each year, which could delay a change of control of us;\n\u2022\nstockholder voting rights and standards for the election of Directors and other provisions which require larger majorities for approval of actions which are not approved by our Board of Directors than for actions which are approved by our Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nthe authority of our Board of Directors, and not our stockholders, to adopt, amend or repeal our bylaws and to fill vacancies on our Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nrequired qualifications for an individual to serve as a Director and a requirement that certain of our Directors be \u201cIndependent Directors\u201d and other Directors be \u201cManaging Directors\u201d, as defined in our bylaws;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the ability of our stockholders to propose nominees for election as Directors and propose other business to be considered at a meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022\ncertain procedural and informational requirements applicable to stockholders requesting that a special meeting be called;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the ability of our stockholders to remove our Directors;\n\u2022\nthe authority of our Board of Directors to create and issue new classes or series of stock (including stock with voting rights and other rights and privileges that may deter a change in control) and issue additional common shares;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on business combinations between us and an interested stockholder that have not first been approved by our Board of Directors (including a majority of Directors not related to the interested stockholder); and\n\u2022\nthe authority of our Board of Directors, without stockholder approval, to implement certain takeover defenses.\nOur management agreements with DHC provide that our rights under those agreements may be cancelled by DHC upon the acquisition by any person or group of more than 9.8% of our voting stock, and upon other change in control events, as defined in those documents, including the adoption of any proposal (other than a precatory proposal) or the election to our Board of Directors of any individual if such proposal or individual was not approved, nominated or appointed, as the case may be, by vote of a majority of our Directors in office immediately prior to the making of such proposal or the nomination or appointment of such individual. In addition, a change in control event of us, including upon the acquisition by any person or group of more than 35% of our voting stock, is a default under our credit agreement, unless approved by our lenders.\nOur rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our Directors and officers are limited.\nOur charter limits the liability of our Directors and officers to us and our stockholders for money damages to the maximum extent permitted under Maryland law. Under current Maryland law, our Directors and officers will not have any liability to us and our stockholders for money damages other than liability resulting from:\n\u2022\nactual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money, property or services; or\n\u2022\nactive and deliberate dishonesty by such Director or officer that was established by a final judgment as being material to the cause of action adjudicated.\nOur charter and contractual obligations authorize and may require us to indemnify, to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law, any present or former Director or officer for actions taken by them in those and other capacities. In addition, we may be obligated to pay or reimburse the expenses incurred by our present and former Directors and officers without requiring a preliminary determination of their ultimate entitlement to indemnification. As a result, we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our present and former Directors and officers than might otherwise exist absent the provisions in our charter and contracts or that might exist with other companies, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 recourse in the event of actions not in their best interest.\nStockholder litigation against us or our Directors, officers, manager, other agents or employees may be referred to mandatory arbitration proceedings, which follow different procedures than in-court litigation and may be more restrictive to stockholders asserting claims than in-court litigation.\nOur stockholders agree, by virtue of becoming stockholders, that they are bound by our governing documents, including the arbitration provisions of our bylaws, as they may be amended from time to time. Our bylaws provide that certain actions by one or more of our stockholders against us or any of our Directors, officers, manager, other agents or employees, other than disputes, or any portion thereof, regarding the meaning, interpretation or validity of any provision of our charter or bylaws, will be referred to mandatory, binding and final arbitration proceedings if we, or any other party to such dispute, including any of our Directors, officers, manager, other agents or employees, unilaterally so demands. As a result, we and our stockholders would not be able to pursue litigation in state or federal court against us or our Directors, officers, manager, other agents or employees, including, for example, claims alleging violations of federal securities laws or breach of fiduciary duties or similar director or officer duties under Maryland law, if we or any of our Directors, officers, manager, other parties or employees, against whom the claim is made unilaterally demands the matter be resolved by arbitration. Instead, our stockholders would be required to pursue such claims through binding and final arbitration.\nOur bylaws provide that such arbitration proceedings would be conducted in accordance with the procedures of the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, as modified by our bylaws. These procedures may provide materially more limited rights to our stockholders than litigation in a federal or state court. For example, arbitration in accordance with these procedures does not include the opportunity for a jury trial, document discovery is limited, arbitration hearings generally are not open to the public, there are no witness depositions in advance of arbitration hearings and arbitrators may have different qualifications or experiences than judges. In addition, although our bylaws\u2019 arbitration provisions contemplate that arbitration may be brought in a representative capacity or on behalf of a class of our stockholders, the rules governing such representation or class arbitration may be different from, and less favorable to, stockholders than the rules governing representative or class action litigation in courts. Our bylaws also generally provide that each party to such an arbitration is required to bear their own costs in the arbitration, including attorneys\u2019 fees, and that the arbitrators may not render an award that includes shifting of such costs or, in a derivative or class proceeding, award any portion of our award to any\nstockholder or such stockholder\u2019s attorneys. The arbitration provisions of our bylaws may discourage our stockholders from bringing, and attorneys from agreeing to represent our stockholders wishing to bring, litigation against us or our Directors, officers, manager, other agents or employees. Our agreements with RMR LLC and DHC have similar arbitration provisions to those in our bylaws.\nWe believe that the arbitration provisions in our bylaws are enforceable under both state and federal law, including with respect to federal securities laws claims. We are a Maryland corporation and Maryland courts have upheld the enforceability of arbitration bylaws. In addition, the United States Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld agreements to arbitrate other federal statutory claims, including those that implicate important federal policies. However, some academics, legal practitioners and others are of the view that charter or bylaw provisions mandating arbitration are not enforceable with respect to federal securities laws claims. It is possible that the arbitration provisions of our bylaws may ultimately be determined to be unenforceable.\nBy agreeing to the arbitration provisions of our bylaws, stockholders will not be deemed to have waived compliance by us with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nOur bylaws designate the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland as the sole and exclusive forum for certain actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our Directors, officers, manager, agents or employees.\nOur bylaws currently provide that, unless the dispute has been referred to binding arbitration, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland will be the sole and exclusive forum for: (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (2) any action asserting a claim for breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any Director, officer, manager, agent or employee of ours to us or our stockholders; (3) any action asserting a claim against us or any Director, officer, manager, agent or employee of ours arising pursuant to Maryland law, our charter or bylaws brought by or on behalf of a stockholder, either on his, her or its own behalf, on our behalf or on behalf of any series or class of shares of stock of ours or by stockholders against us or any Director, officer, agent, or employee of ours, or our manager, including any disputes, claims or controversies relating to the meaning, interpretation, effect, validity, performance or enforcement of the charter or bylaws; or (4) any action asserting a claim against us or any Director, officer, agent, employee, or manager of ours that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Our bylaws currently also provide that the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland will be the sole and exclusive forum for any dispute, or portion thereof, regarding the meaning, interpretation or validity of any provision of our charter or bylaws. The exclusive forum provision of our bylaws does not apply to any action for which the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland does not have jurisdiction or to a dispute that has been referred to binding arbitration in accordance with our bylaws. The exclusive forum provision of our bylaws does not establish exclusive jurisdiction in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland for claims that arise under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Exchange Act or other federal securities laws if there is exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction in the federal courts. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in our common shares shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to these provisions of our bylaws, as they may be amended from time to time. The arbitration and exclusive forum provisions of our bylaws may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that the stockholder believes is favorable for disputes with us or our Directors, officers, agents, employees, or our manager, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our Directors, officers, agents, employees or our manager.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nIf we fail to operate profitably, the value of our securities may decline and could become worthless.\nWe have incurred operating losses in each of our past four fiscal years and we had an accumulated deficit of $245.2 million as of December 31, 2019, and we had net negative cash flows from operations in recent prior years. Since December 31, 2018, we have taken various actions to improve our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, including completing the Restructuring Transactions on January 1, 2020. Although we believe these actions will allow us to operate profitably in the future, our business remains subject to various risks, including those noted in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, some of which are beyond our control. As a result, we may fail to operate profitably in the future, despite the actions we have taken. If we fail to operate profitably, the value of our securities may decline and could become worthless.\nThe number of common shares we issued in connection with the Restructuring Transactions may significantly impact our share price and volatility.\nIn connection with the Restructuring Transactions, on January 1, 2020, we issued an aggregate of 26,387,007 of our common shares to DHC and to DHC shareholders of record as of December 13, 2019, which resulted in DHC owning 33.9% and those DHC shareholders owning 51.1% of our then outstanding common shares as of that date. The number of our common shares issued in the Share Issuances represents a significant percentage of our currently outstanding common shares. The trading, the lack of trading, or any market expectations of the trading or lack of trading of those shares may significantly impact the trading price and liquidity of our common shares.\nAny future equity issuances we may make may significantly dilute our stockholders\u2019 equity interests.\nThe trading price of our common shares is currently well below the historical trading prices for our common shares, adjusting for the one-for-ten reverse stock split that we completed on September 30, 2019. If we issue additional common shares at or near current trading price levels, certain of our pre-existing stockholders, especially our long-term stockholders, may experience significant dilution of their equity interests.\nIf we fail to maintain compliance with the minimum bid price requirements of the Nasdaq listing standards, Nasdaq may determine to delist our common shares, which could negatively impact the market price and liquidity of our common shares and reduce our ability to raise additional capital.\nOn October 22, 2018, we received a letter from Nasdaq informing us that we were not in compliance with the minimum bid price Nasdaq standard for continued listing on Nasdaq. On September 30, 2019, we completed a one-for-ten reverse stock split of our outstanding common shares, which resulted in the closing bid price of our common shares exceeding the $1.00 per share minimum bid price requirement for the applicable period. Consequently, on October 15, 2019, we received a letter from Nasdaq informing us that we had regained compliance with the minimum bid price standard for continued listing on Nasdaq. We cannot be sure that we will be able to maintain compliance with this listing standard or that we will otherwise be in compliance with other Nasdaq listing standards. If we fail to maintain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement or to meet other applicable continued listing standards of Nasdaq in the future, and Nasdaq determines to delist our common shares, the market price and liquidity of our common shares could be negatively impacted and our ability to raise additional capital could be reduced.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common shares in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common shares, and we currently do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nChanges in market conditions could adversely affect the value of our securities.\nAs with other publicly traded securities, the value of our securities depends on various market conditions and other factors that are subject to change from time to time, including:\n\u2022\nthe extent of investor interest in our securities;\n\u2022\nthe liquidity of the market for our securities;\n\u2022\ninvestor confidence in the stock markets, generally;\n\u2022\nchanges in our operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in analysts\u2019 expectations;\n\u2022\nmarket interest rates;\n\u2022\nnational economic conditions; and\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions.\nIn addition, the stock market in recent years has experienced broad price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also cause the value of our securities to decline. Stockholders may be unable to resell our common shares at or above the price at which they purchased our common shares.", "PERMNO": 89252, "SIC": 8051, "TIC": "FVE"}
