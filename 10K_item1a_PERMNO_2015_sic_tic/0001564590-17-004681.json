{"cik": "1674930", "company": "Fulgent Genetics, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-17", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Before making any investment decision with respect to our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below and all of the other information included in this report and the other filings we make with the SEC. We believe the risks and uncertainties described below are the most significant we face. The occurrence of any of these risks could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects and reputation and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business.\nBusiness and Strategy Risks\nOur industry is subject to rapidly changing technology and new and increasing amounts of scientific data, and if we fail to keep pace with these technological advances, we may be unable to compete effectively and our business and prospects could suffer.\nIn recent years, there have been numerous advances in the analysis of large amounts of genomic information and the role of genetics and gene variants in disease diagnosis and treatment. Our industry has been, and we believe will continue to be, characterized by rapid technological change, increasing amounts of data, frequent introductions of new genetic tests and evolving industry standards, all of which could make our tests obsolete if we are not able to enhance our technologies and tests faster and better than our competitors to maintain our competitive advantage. Our future success will depend on our ability to keep pace with the evolving needs of our customers in a timely and cost-effective manner and to pursue new market opportunities that develop as a result of technological and scientific advances. If we are not able to keep pace with technological advances and increased customer expectations that develop as a result of these advances, we may be unable to sustain or grow our business and our future operations and prospects could suffer.\nWe are an early-stage company with a limited operating history, which may expose us to enhanced risks and increase the difficulty of evaluating our business and prospects.\nWe began operations in May 2012 and commercially launched our first genetic tests in 2013. As a result, we have only a limited operating history upon which you can evaluate our business and prospects. Our revenue growth may not continue or increase, we may not achieve profitability and, if we achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain it. Our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and inhibits our ability to forecast our future operating results, including revenue, cash flows and movement toward profitability. Our limited operating history makes it difficult to determine if these fluctuations reflect seasonality in our performance or are the result of other events. We have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in the life sciences and technology industries, such as risks related to an evolving and unpredictable industry and business model, management of growth and other uncertainties described in this report. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties are incorrect or these risks and uncertainties change due to changes in our markets, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our operating and financial results could differ materially from our expectations and our business could suffer.\nWe have a history of losses, and we may never be able to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe have a history of losses. For 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded a loss from continuing operations of $5.4 million, $5.0 million and $990,000, respectively. To date, we have generated limited revenue, and we may never achieve revenue sufficient to offset our expenses and achieve or sustain profitability. In addition, we may continue to incur losses in the future, particularly as we focus on growing our business and operations and experience expected increases in expenses related to this growth. Our prior losses and any future losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital. Our failure to achieve and sustain profitability in the future would negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nSales to a small number of customers have represented a significant portion of our revenue in certain periods, and the loss of, or a significant reduction in sales to, any one of these customers could materially harm our business.\nThe composition of our customer base can fluctuate from period to period, as our key customers experience volatility in their genetic testing demand. In certain periods, a small number of customers has accounted for a significant portion of our revenue. For instance, in 2016, Customers A and B each contributed 15% of our total revenue, and Customer B also contributed 19% and 11% of our total revenue in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Generally, we do not have long-term purchase agreements with any of our customers and, as result, any or all of them could decide at any time to discontinue, decrease or delay their orders from us. In addition, the prices that our customers pay for our products could be subject to fluctuations. Further, the failure of any one of our key customers to pay on a timely basis would negatively impact our cash flows from operations. Our ability to maintain or increase sales to our key customers\ndepends on a variety of factors, including the other risk factors discussed in this report, many of which are beyond our control. Because of these and other factors, sales to these customers may not continue and the amount of such sales may not reach or exceed historical levels in any future period. The loss of any of our key customers or a reduction in orders or difficulties collecting payments from any of them could significantly reduce our revenue and adversely affect our operating results.\nIf we are not able to grow and diversify our customer base and increase demand for our tests from existing and new customers, our commercial success would be limited.\nTo achieve our anticipated revenue growth, we must increase test volume by further penetrating our existing hospital and medical institution customers. In addition, we must grow our customer base beyond hospitals and medical institutions and into additional customer groups, such as individual physicians, other practitioners and research institutions. To this end, we have made efforts to diversify our customer base beyond hospitals by establishing a vendor code with a national clinical laboratory that orders our tests to fulfill some of the genetic testing orders it receives from certain U.S. government agencies and contracting with a regional hospital network within the U.S. Army to provide genetic tests for members and their families. We have also pursued relationships with payors, including Medicare, some state Medicaid programs and third-party payors, in order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for our tests to make them accessible to more individual physicians. Establishing these relationships means that we have agreed with the applicable payor, laboratory or other customer to provide certain of our tests at negotiated rates, but, except for our relationship with the hospital network within the U.S. Army, which involves a minimum commitment of approximately $400,000 of our tests annually over a three-year period, none of these relationships obligate any party to order our tests at any agreed volume or frequency, or at all. Further, our relationship with the hospital network within the U.S. Army is subject to unique risks associated with government contracts, including cancellation if adequate appropriations for subsequent performance periods are not made and modification or termination at their convenience and without prior notice. As a result, these relationships, or any similar relationships we may establish in the future, may not amount to meaningful increases in our customer base, the number of billable tests we deliver or our total revenue, or improve our ability to achieve profitability. We may not succeed in facilitating the clinical acceptance and adoption of our tests needed to achieve the increased volumes and customer growth we expect. Because detailed genetic data from tests such as ours have only recently become available at relatively affordable prices, the pace and degree of market acceptance and adoption of these tests is uncertain.\nWe may fail to expand our customer base and grow our volume of tests delivered for a variety of reasons, including, among others:\n\u2022\nthe genetic testing market generally, and particularly the market for NGS genetic tests, is relatively new and may not grow as predicted or may decline;\n\u2022\nour efforts to improve our existing tests and develop and launch new tests may be unsuccessful;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to convince additional hospitals and medical institutions or additional customer groups, such as individual physicians, other practitioners and research institutions, of the utility of our tests and their potential advantages over existing and new alternatives;\n\u2022\nour efforts to increase our sales force and expand our marketing efforts may fail;\n\u2022\nwe may be unsuccessful in demonstrating the benefits of our broad and customizable test menu;\n\u2022\ngenetic testing is expensive and many existing and potential new customers may be sensitive to pricing, particularly if we are not able to maintain low prices relative to our competitors;\n\u2022\npotential new customers, particularly individual physicians and other practitioners, may not adopt our tests if coverage and adequate reimbursement are not available;\n\u2022\nnegative publicity or regulatory investigations into the actions of companies within our industry could raise doubts about the legitimacy of diagnostics technologies generally, and could result in scrutiny of diagnostic activities by the FDA or other applicable government agencies; and\n\u2022\nour competitors could introduce new tests that cover more genes or that provide more accurate or reliable results at the same or a lower price than ours.\nIf we are unable to address these and other risks associated with growing our customer base and deepening our relationships with existing customers, we may not achieve our anticipated growth in billable tests and our results of operations would be adversely impacted.\nWe face intense competition, which is likely to intensify further as existing competitors devote additional resources to, and new participants enter, the market, and if we cannot compete successfully, we may be unable to increase our revenue or achieve or grow profitability.\nWith the development of NGS, the clinical genetic testing market has become increasingly competitive, and we expect this competition to further intensify in the future. We face competition from a variety of sources, including, among others:\n\u2022\ndozens of companies focused on molecular genetic testing services, including specialty and reference laboratories that offer traditional single-gene and multi-gene tests, such as Ambry Genetics, Inc.; Counsyl Inc.; Foundation Medicine, Inc.; GeneDx, a subsidiary of OPKO Health, Inc.; Invitae Corporation; Myriad Genetics, Inc.; and Pathway Genomics Corporation, as well as other commercial and academic laboratories; and\n\u2022\nestablished and emerging healthcare, information technology and service companies that may develop and sell competitive tests, which may include informatics, analysis, integrated genetic tools and services for health and wellness.\nAdditionally, participants in closely related markets, such as prenatal testing and clinical trial or companion diagnostic testing, could converge on offerings that are competitive with the type of tests we perform. Instances where potential competitors are aligned with key suppliers or are themselves suppliers could provide such potential competitors with significant advantages. Further, hospitals, research institutions and eventually individual physicians and other practitioners may also seek to perform at their own facilities the type of genetic testing we would otherwise perform for them. In this regard, continued development of, and associated decreases in the cost of, equipment, reagents and other materials and databases and genetic data interpretation services may enable broader direct participation in genetic testing and analysis and drive down the use of third-party testing companies such as ours. Moreover, the biotechnology and genetic testing fields continue to undergo significant consolidation, permitting larger clinical laboratory service providers to increase cost efficiencies and service levels, resulting in more intense competition.\nMany of our existing and potential future competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, greater brand recognition and market penetration, substantially greater financial, technological and research and development resources and selling and marketing capabilities, and considerably more experience dealing with third-party payors. As a result, they may be able to respond more quickly to changes in customer requirements or preferences, devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their tests, devote more resources to and obtain more favorable results from third-party payors regarding coverage and reimbursement for their offerings, adopt more aggressive pricing policies for their tests, secure supplies from vendors on more favorable terms or devote substantially more resources to infrastructure and systems development. We may not be able to compete effectively against these organizations.\nAdditionally, increased competition and cost-saving initiatives on the part of government entities and other third-party payors could result in pricing pressures, which could harm our sales or ability to gain market share and achieve profitability. In addition, competitors may be acquired by, receive investments from or enter into other commercial relationships with larger, well-established and well-financed companies as use of NGS for clinical diagnosis and preventative care increases. Further, companies or governments that effectively control access to genetic testing through umbrella contracts or regional preferences could promote our competitors or prevent us from performing certain tests in certain territories. If we are unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors, we may be unable to increase market acceptance and sales volume of our tests, which could prevent us from increasing our revenue or achieving or growing profitability.\nWe will need to invest in and expand our infrastructure and hire additional skilled personnel in order to support our anticipated growth, and our failure to effectively manage any future growth could jeopardize our business.\nTo increase the volume of tests that we offer and deliver, we must invest in our infrastructure, including our testing capacity and information systems, enterprise software systems, customer service, billing and collections systems and processes and internal quality assurance programs, in the near term. We will also need to invest in hiring additional skilled personnel, including biostatisticians, geneticists, software engineers, laboratory directors and specialists, sales and marketing experts and other scientific, technical and managerial personnel to market, process, interpret and validate the quality of results of our genetic tests and otherwise manage our operations. For example, before we deliver a report for any of our genetic tests, the results summarized in the report must be reviewed and approved by a licensed and qualified laboratory director. We currently have only one such laboratory director with all of the required licenses, Dr. Han Lin Gao, who conducts this review and approval for each test we deliver. We are in the process of licensing additional laboratory directors to assist Dr. Gao, and we may need to hire more laboratory directors in the future to further scale our business. If we fail to hire additional qualified personnel or otherwise develop our infrastructure sufficiently in advance of demand or if we fail to generate demand commensurate with our level of investment in our infrastructure, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Additionally, although we do not presently have plans to acquire new or expand our existing laboratory space, we may need to do so in the future as our volumes increase, and any need to obtain an additional facility or replace our existing facility with a larger one would involve significant challenges.\nThe time and resources required to implement new systems, to add and train additional skilled personnel and to acquire or expand laboratory space as needed are uncertain. Any future growth we may experience could create a strain on our organizational, administrative and operational infrastructure, including laboratory operations, quality control, customer service, sales and marketing and management. We may not be able to maintain the quality of or expected turnaround times for our tests or satisfy customer demand if and when it grows. Our ability to effectively manage any growth we experience will also require us to continue to improve our laboratory and other operational, financial and management systems and controls and our reporting processes and procedures, which we may not be able to do.\nWe have limited experience marketing and selling our tests and our commercial success will depend in part upon our ability to grow our sales and marketing team and generate sales using this relatively small internal and developing team.\nWe have limited experience marketing and selling our tests, which we began selling in 2013. We may not be able to market or sell our existing tests or any future tests we may develop in order to drive demand sufficient to support our planned growth. We currently sell our tests in the United States through a small internal sales force and outside the United States through one internal sales person and we have historically relied significantly on organic growth and word-of-mouth among our customers to generate interest in our tests. Our ability to maintain and grow sales volume in the future will depend in large part upon our ability to develop and substantially expand our sales team and to increase the scope of our marketing efforts. We intend to aggressively build our sales and marketing team in the near term in order to pursue expansion of our customer base and growth in the volume of tests ordered, with the goal of more than doubling the size of our sales and marketing team in the next 12 months. This expansion will involve significant time and expense. Additionally, we may not be able to attract and hire the qualified personnel we need to grow our sales and marketing team as quickly as we intend for various reasons, including intense competition in our industry for qualified personnel. Even if we are able to further develop our sales and marketing team, we have limited experience managing a sales and marketing team and it may not be successful in growing our customer base or increasing penetration into our existing customers.\nIn addition, our future sales will depend in large part upon our ability to expand our brand awareness, laterally grow our customer base and vertically penetrate our relationships with existing customers by educating the medical community, including existing and potential future customers, about the benefits and the full scale of our offering. We also intend to obtain publication of scientific and medical results in peer-reviewed journals and make presentations at leading industry conferences. We have limited experience with this type of activity and we may not be successful in implementing these initiatives. If we are not able to drive sufficient levels of revenue using our sales and marketing strategies to support our planned growth, our business and results of operations would be negatively affected. Additionally, if we are not able to obtain sufficient clinical information in support of our tests, third-party payors could designate our tests as experimental or investigational and decline to cover and reimburse our tests as a result of such designation.\nWe also intend to increase our focus on growing our international sales and customer base. Outside the United States, we use and intend to continue to use one internal sales person, and we may also engage distributors or establish other types of arrangements, such as joint ventures or other partner relationships, to assist with sales, logistics, education and customer support in the future. To this end, we are working with Xi Long, a large stockholder of our company, to develop a strategic commercial relationship to pursue additional customers in China, which we expect to be finalized in the first half of 2017. We anticipate that this relationship, if it proceeds, could expand our long-term opportunities to address the genetic testing market in Asia; however, the terms of this relationship have not been finalized and we may never be successful in forming this relationship or realizing any of the benefits we anticipate from it. We believe identifying, qualifying and engaging distributors or other partners with local industry experience and knowledge will be necessary to effectively market and sell our tests outside the United States. We may not be successful in finding, attracting and retaining qualified distributors or other partners or we may not be able to enter into arrangements covering desired territories on favorable terms. Sales practices utilized by distributors or other partners that are locally acceptable may not comply with sales practices or standards required under U.S. laws that apply to us, which could subject us to additional compliance risks. If our sales and marketing efforts are not successful outside the United States, we may not achieve significant market acceptance for our tests in international markets, which could materially and adversely impact our business operations.\nIf we are sued for product or professional liability, we could face substantial liabilities that exceed our resources.\nOur business depends upon our ability to provide reliable and accurate test results that incorporate rapidly evolving information about the role of genes and gene variants in disease and clinically relevant outcomes associated with those variants. Hundreds of genes can be implicated in some disorders and overlapping networks of genes and symptoms can be implicated in multiple conditions. As a result, a substantial amount of judgment is required in order to interpret the results of each test we perform and produce a report summarizing these results. Errors, such as failures to detect genomic variants with high accuracy, or mistakes, such as failures to completely and correctly identify the significance of gene variants, could subject us to product liability or professional liability claims. A product liability or professional liability claim against us could result in substantial damages and be costly and time-consuming to defend. Although we maintain liability insurance, including for errors and omissions, our insurance may not fully protect us from the financial impact of defending against these types of claims or any judgments, fines or settlement costs arising out of any such claims.\nAny liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our insurance rates or prevent us from securing adequate insurance coverage in the future. Additionally, any liability lawsuit could damage our reputation or force us to suspend sales of our tests. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations.\nOur ability to achieve profitability depends upon our ability to collect payment for the tests we deliver to hospitals and medical institutions, which we may not be able to do successfully.\nWe are currently, and we have been since starting our genetic testing business, focused primarily on providing our tests to hospitals and medical institutions. These customers are typically able to pay for the cost of our tests using funds reimbursed in connection with a patient\u2019s diagnosis related group, or DRG. However, our ability to collect payment for the tests we perform is subject to a number of risks, many of which are not within our control, including risks of default or bankruptcy by the party responsible for payment and other risks associated with payment collection generally. Further, healthcare policy changes that influence the way healthcare is financed or other changes in the market that impact payment rates by institutional or non-institutional customers could affect our collection rates. For example, because reimbursement under a DRG is typically provided at a fixed amount intended to cover all services provided to the patient, the cost of our tests may be viewed to limit the profitability of the billing institution. If we are unable to convince hospitals and medical institutions of the value and benefit provided by our tests, or if the amount reimbursed under these DRG codes was decreased, these customers may slow, or stop altogether, their purchasing of our tests. Moreover, our ability to collect payment for our tests in a timely manner or at all may decline to the extent we expand our business into new customer groups, including individual physicians and other practitioners, from which collection rates may be lower than hospitals and medical institutions.\nIf third-party payors do not provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for our tests, our commercial success could be limited.\nCoverage and reimbursement by third-party payors, including managed care organizations, private health insurers and government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, for the types of genetic tests we perform can be limited and uncertain. Although our existing customer base consists primarily of hospitals and medical institutions, from which we typically receive direct payment for ordered tests, we believe our potential for future success is dependent upon our ability to attract new customer groups, including individual physicians and other practitioners. These practitioners may not order our tests unless third-party payors cover and provide adequate reimbursement for a substantial portion of the price of our tests. If we are not able to obtain coverage and an acceptable level of reimbursement for our tests from third-party payors, there would typically be a greater co-insurance or co-payment requirement from the patient for whom the test is ordered or the patient may be forced to pay the entire cost of the test out-of-pocket, which could dissuade practitioners from ordering our tests and, if ordered, could result in delay in or decreased likelihood of our collection of payment, whether from patients or from third-party payors. We believe our ability to increase the number of tests we sell and our revenue will depend upon our success in achieving broad coverage and reimbursement for our tests from third-party payors.\nCoverage and reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend on a number of factors, including a payor\u2019s determination that a test is appropriate, medically necessary and cost-effective. Each payor makes its own decision as to whether to establish a policy or enter into a contract to cover our tests and the amount it will reimburse for a test, and seeking a determination by a payor to cover our tests and the amount it will reimburse for our tests would likely be made on an indication-by-indication basis. In addition, the coding procedure used by all third-party payors with respect to establishing payment rates for various procedures, including our tests, is complex, does not currently adapt well to the genetic tests we perform and may not enable coverage and adequate reimbursement rates for our tests. As a result, obtaining approvals from third-party payors to cover our tests and establishing adequate reimbursement levels is an unpredictable, challenging, time-consuming and costly process, and we may never be successful.\nTo date, we have contracted with a regional physician services organization and a national health insurance company to become an in-network provider. We have also enrolled as a supplier in the Medicare program and in 10 state Medicaid programs, but we have not obtained any coverage, pricing or reimbursement approvals from payors in any countries outside of the United States. Although becoming an in-network provider or enrolling as a supplier means that we have agreed with these payors to provide certain of our tests at negotiated rates, it does not obligate any physicians to order our tests or guarantee that we will receive reimbursement for our tests from these or any other payors at adequate levels. Thus, these payor relationships, or any similar relationships we may establish in the future, may not result in acceptable levels of reimbursement for our tests or meaningful increases in our physician customer base or the number of billable tests we sell to physicians. We expect to focus on increasing coverage and reimbursement for our current tests and any future tests we may develop. We believe it may take several years to achieve coverage and adequate contracted reimbursement with third-party payors. However, we cannot predict whether, under what circumstances, or at what payment levels payors will cover and reimburse for our tests. If we fail to establish and maintain broad coverage and reimbursement for our tests, our ability to generate increased revenue and grow our test volume and customer base could be limited and our future prospects and our business could suffer.\nIf our sole laboratory facility becomes inoperable, if we are forced to vacate the facility or if we are unable to obtain additional laboratory space as and when needed, we would be unable to perform our tests and our business would be harmed.\nWe perform all of our tests at a single laboratory in Temple City, California. Our laboratory facility could be damaged or rendered inoperable by natural or man-made disasters, including earthquakes, floods, fires and power outages, which could render it difficult or impossible for us to perform our tests for some period of time. The inability to perform our tests or the backlog that could develop if our laboratory is inoperable for even a short period of time could result in the loss of customers or harm to our reputation. Although we maintain insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.\nFurther, if we need to move to a different facility or locate additional laboratory space as our business grows, we may have difficulty locating suitable space in a timely manner, on reasonable terms or at all, and even if acceptable space was available, it would be challenging, time-consuming and expensive to obtain or transfer the licensure and accreditation required for a commercial laboratory like ours and the equipment we use to perform our tests. These challenges could be amplified if we or our partners seek to procure laboratory space outside the United States as we seek to expand our international operations. If we are unable to obtain or are delayed in obtaining new laboratory space as needed, we may not be able to provide existing tests or develop and launch new tests, which could result in harm to our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nEthical, legal and social concerns related to the use of genetic information could reduce demand for our tests.\nGenetic testing has raised ethical, legal and social issues regarding privacy and the appropriate uses of the resulting information. Government authorities could, for social or other purposes, limit or regulate the use of genetic information or genetic testing or prohibit testing for genetic predisposition to certain conditions, particularly for those that have no known cure. Similarly, these concerns may lead patients to refuse to use or physicians to be reluctant to order genetic tests, even if permissible. These and other ethical, legal and social concerns may limit market acceptance and adoption of our tests or reduce the potential markets for our tests, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on a limited number of suppliers and, in some cases, a sole supplier, for some of our laboratory instruments and materials and we may not be able to find replacements or immediately transition to alternative suppliers if necessary.\nWe rely on a limited number of suppliers, or, in the case of Illumina, Inc., a sole supplier, for certain laboratory substances used in the chemical reactions incorporated into our processes, which we refer to as reagents, as well as for the sequencers and various other equipment and materials that we use in our laboratory operations. We do not have long-term agreements with any of our suppliers and, as a result, they could cease supplying these materials and equipment to us at any time or fail to provide us with sufficient quantities of materials that meet our specifications. Our laboratory operations would be interrupted if we encounter delays or difficulties in securing these reagents, sequencers or other equipment or materials or if we need a substitute for any of our suppliers and are not able to locate and make arrangements with an acceptable substitute. Any such interruption could significantly affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation. We rely on Illumina as the sole supplier of the next generation sequencers and associated reagents we use to perform our genetic tests and as the sole provider of maintenance and repair services for these sequencers. Any disruption in Illumina\u2019s operations could impact our supply chain and laboratory operations as well as our ability to conduct our tests.\nWe believe there are only a few other manufacturers that are currently capable of supplying and servicing the equipment necessary for our laboratory operations, including sequencers and various associated reagents. Transitioning to a new supplier would be time-consuming and expensive, could result in interruptions in or otherwise affect the performance specifications of our laboratory operations or could require that we revalidate our tests. In addition, the use of equipment or materials provided by a replacement supplier could require us to alter our laboratory operations and procedures. In the case of obtaining an alternative supplier for Illumina, replacement sequencers and associated reagents that meet our quality control and performance requirements may not be available on reasonable terms, in a timely manner or at all. If we encounter delays or difficulties in securing, reconfiguring or revalidating the equipment and reagents we require for our tests, our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation would be adversely affected.\nWe rely on a third-party for certain portions of our billing and collection processing, which is complex and time-consuming, and any delay in transmitting and collecting claims could have an adverse effect on our future revenue.\nWe have engaged a third-party service provider for certain claims processing, billing and collection functions. Billing for our tests is complex, time-consuming and expensive. Depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law, we plan to bill various payors, including customers directly in the case of our hospital and medical institution customers, as well as Medicare, Medicaid, insurance companies and patients, all of which may have different billing requirements. We may face increased risk in our collection\nefforts due to the complexities of these billing requirements, including long collection cycles, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSeveral factors make the billing process complex, including:\n\u2022\ndifferences between the list price for our tests and the reimbursement rates of payors;\n\u2022\ncompliance with complex federal and state regulations related to billing government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u2022\ndisputes among payors as to which party is responsible for payment;\n\u2022\ndifferences in coverage among payors and the effect of patient co-payments or co-insurance;\n\u2022\ndifferences in information and billing requirements among payors;\n\u2022\nincorrect or missing billing information; and\n\u2022\nthe resources required to manage the billing and claims appeals process.\nEven though we have engaged a third party to assist with some of these billing and collections functions, we will still need to make significant efforts and expend substantial resources to develop systems and procedures to handle these aspects of our business, which will become increasingly important as we focus on establishing coverage and reimbursement policies with third-party payors. As a result, these billing complexities, along with the related uncertainty in obtaining payment for our tests, could negatively affect our revenue and cash flow, our ability to achieve profitability and the consistency and comparability of our results of operations. In addition, if claims for our tests are not submitted to payors on a timely basis, or if we are required to switch to a different provider to handle our processing and collections functions, it could have an adverse effect on our revenue and our business.\nWe are exposed to additional business, regulatory, political, operational, financial and economic risks related to our international operations.\nOur existing customer base includes international customers, many of which are based in Canada. Approximately $10.0 million, $4.5 million and $638,000 of our revenue came from non-U.S. customers in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and of this, approximately $3.8 million, $2.7 million and $194,000 in the respective periods came from customers located in Canada. Our business strategy includes plans to increase this volume in the near term, from customers in Canada and other geographic markets, including Asia and Europe. To this end, we recorded revenues of $3.2 million from tests ordered by customers in China in 2016 and we are working with Xi Long to develop a strategic commercial relationship in order to further pursue our opportunities in this market, although this relationship has not been, and may never be, finalized or successful. We may also enter into new geographic markets and increase our presence in existing foreign markets by engaging distributors or joining with other partners to conduct physician outreach activities and develop and expand payor relationships outside of the United States.\nDoing business internationally involves a number of risks, including, among others:\n\u2022\nmultiple, conflicting and evolving laws and regulations, such as privacy regulations, tax laws, employment laws, regulatory requirements and other government approvals, permits and licenses;\n\u2022\nlogistics and regulations associated with shipping blood or other tissue specimens, including infrastructure conditions, transportation delays, export and import restrictions and other trade barriers, such as tariffs or other charges, all of which involve increased uncertainty following the results of the 2016 U.S. presidential election as the trade policies of the current administration may threaten existing and proposed trade agreements and impose more restrictive U.S. export-import regulations;\n\u2022\nlimits on our ability to penetrate international markets if we do not conduct our tests locally, including local legal and regulatory requirements that would force us to build additional laboratories or engage in joint ventures or other partner relationships in order to offer our tests in certain countries;\n\u2022\nfailure by us or any distributors or other partners we may engage in the future to obtain regulatory approvals for the use of our tests in various countries;\n\u2022\ncomplexities and difficulties in obtaining protection for and enforcing our intellectual property;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\ncomplexities associated with managing multiple payor coverage and reimbursement regimes, government payors or patient self-pay systems;\n\u2022\nfinancial risks, such as longer payment cycles, difficulty collecting accounts receivable, the impact of local and regional financial conditions on demand and payment for our tests and exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, political and economic instability, including wars, terrorism, and political unrest, outbreak of disease, boycotts, curtailment of trade and other business restrictions; and\n\u2022\nregulatory and compliance risks that relate to prohibiting bribery and maintaining accurate information and control over activities that may fall within the purview of applicable anti-bribery laws.\nAny of these factors could significantly harm our existing relationships with international customers or derail our international expansion plans, which would cause our revenue and results of operations to suffer.\nWe may not be successful in developing and marketing new tests, which could negatively impact our performance and prospects.\nWe believe our future success will depend upon our ability to continue to expand our test offering and develop and sell new tests. For instance, in 2016 we launched a new chromosomal test called CNV+ that is designed to use NGS technology to detect copy number variants with similar or improved results as compared to microarray-based genomic tests. We expect these tests will target customers that are already using microarray-based testing; however, these tests may not be accepted as a replacement for microarray-based tests and they may not be adopted by these customers or at all. In addition, we expect to offer somatic testing for certain cancers in the near future. We may not be successful in launching or marketing these or any other new tests we may develop or, if we are successful, the demand for our other tests could decrease or may not continue to increase at historical rates due to sales of the new tests.\nOur pipeline of new tests is in various stages of development and will be time-consuming and costly to fully develop and introduce, as development and marketing of new tests requires us to conduct research and development and further develop and scale our laboratory processes and infrastructure to be able to analyze increasing amounts of more diverse data. Further, we may be unable to discover or develop new tests for a variety of reasons, including failure of any proposed test to perform as expected, lack of validation or reference data for the test or failure to demonstrate the utility of the test. Further, any new test we are able to develop may not be launched in a timely manner, meet applicable regulatory standards, successfully compete with other technologies and available tests, avoid infringing the proprietary rights of others, achieve coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, be capable of performance at commercial levels and at reasonable costs, be successfully marketed or achieve sufficient market acceptance for us to recoup our time and capital investment in the development of the test. Any failure to successfully develop and sell new tests could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain customers and our revenue and prospects.\nActual or attempted security breaches, loss of data and other disruptions could compromise sensitive information related to our business or to patients or prevent us from accessing critical information, any of which could expose us to liability and adversely affect our business and our reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we and a third-party billing and collections provider that we have engaged generate, collect and store sensitive data, including PHI, personally identifiable information, intellectual property and proprietary information and other business-critical information, such as research and development data, commercial information and business and financial information. We manage and maintain the data we generate, collect and store utilizing a combination of on-site systems and managed data center systems. We also communicate sensitive patient data when we deliver reports summarizing test results to our customers, which we deliver via our online encrypted web portal, encrypted email or fax or overnight courier. We face a number of risks related to protecting this information, including loss of access, inappropriate disclosure, unauthorized modification and inability to adequately implement protective controls.\nThe secure processing, storage, maintenance and transmission of this critical information are vital to our operations and business strategy and we devote significant resources to protecting the confidentiality and integrity of this information. Although we have implemented security measures designed to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure, our information technology and infrastructure and that of our third-party billing and collections provider could fail, be inadequate or vulnerable to attacks by hackers or viruses or be breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. A breach or interruption could compromise our information systems and the information we store could be accessed by unauthorized parties, manipulated, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such unauthorized access, manipulation, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings and could result in liability or penalties under federal and state laws that protect the privacy of personal information, discussed below under \u201cWe are subject to broad legal requirements regarding the information we test and analyze and any failure to comply with these requirements could result in harsh penalties, damage our reputation and materially harm our business.\u201d Additionally, unauthorized access, manipulation, loss or dissemination could significantly damage our reputation and disrupt our operations, including our ability to perform our tests, analyze and provide test results, bill customers or other payors, process claims for reimbursement, provide customer service, conduct research and development activities, collect, process, and\nprepare company financial information, conduct education and outreach activities and manage the administrative aspects of our business, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nThe loss of any member of our senior management team could adversely affect our business.\nOur success depends in large part upon the skills, experience and performance of our executive management team and others in key leadership positions, especially Ming Hsieh, our founder and Chief Executive Officer, and Dr. Gao, our Chief Scientific Officer and Lab Director. The continued efforts of these persons will be critical to us as we continue to develop our technologies and test processes and focus on growing our business. If we lose one or more key executives, we could experience difficulties maintaining our operations, including delivering reports to customers after review and approval by a licensed and qualified laboratory director, competing effectively, advancing our technologies, developing new tests and implementing our business strategies. All of our executives and employees, including Mr. Hsieh and Dr. Gao, are at-will, which means that either we or the executive or employee may terminate their employment at any time. We do not carry key man insurance for any of our executives or other employees. In addition, we do not have a long-term retention agreement in place with any of our executives or key employees.\nWe rely on highly skilled personnel in a broad array of disciplines, and if we are unable to hire, retain or motivate these individuals, we may not be able to maintain the quality of our tests or grow effectively.\nOur performance, including our research and development programs and laboratory operations, largely depends upon our continued ability to identify, hire, train, motivate and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization, including biostatisticians, geneticists, software engineers, laboratory directors and specialists, sales and marketing experts and other scientific, technical and managerial personnel. Competition in our industry for qualified executives and other employees is intense and we may not be able to attract or retain the qualified personnel we need to execute our business plan due to high levels of competition for these personnel among our competitors, other life science businesses, universities and public and private research institutions. In addition, our compensation arrangements may not be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees. If we are not able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we may experience constraints that could adversely affect our ability to expand our business and support our clinical laboratory operations and our sales and marketing and research and development efforts, which would negatively affect our prospects for future growth and success.\nOur inability to obtain additional capital in the future when needed and on acceptable terms may limit our ability to execute our business plans.\nWe expect our capital expenditures and operating expenses to increase over the next several years as we expand our infrastructure, sales and marketing and other commercial operations and research and development activities. We may seek to raise additional capital through securities offerings, credit facilities or other debt financings, asset sales or collaborations or licensing arrangements. Additional funding may not be available to us when needed, on acceptable terms or at all. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities, our existing stockholders could experience substantial dilution. Additionally, any preferred equity securities we issue could provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock, and our issuance of any additional equity securities, or the possibility of such an issuance, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. The terms of debt securities issued or borrowings, if available, could impose significant restrictions on our operations, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt or issue additional equity, limitations on our ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business, and would result in increased fixed payment obligations. In the event that we seek to sell assets or enter into collaborations or licensing arrangements to raise capital, we may be required to accept unfavorable terms or relinquish or license to a third party our rights to important or valuable technologies or tests we may otherwise seek to develop ourselves. Moreover, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital, including investment banking, legal and accounting fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs. If we are not able to secure additional funding when needed and on reasonable terms, we may be forced to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more sales and marketing initiatives, research and development programs or other growth plans or strategies. In addition, we may be forced to work with a partner on one or more aspects of our tests or market development programs or initiatives, which could lower the economic value of these tests, programs or initiatives to our company. Any such outcome could significantly harm our business, performance and prospects.\nWe may acquire businesses or assets, form joint ventures, make investments in other companies or technologies or establish other strategic relationships that could harm our operating results, dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership or cause us to incur debt or significant expense.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses or assets, investments in other companies, technology licensing arrangements, joint ventures or strategic relationships, including partnerships with pharmaceutical companies to further develop our pharmacogenomics opportunities. As an organization, we have limited experience with respect to acquisitions, investments or the formation of strategic relationships or joint ventures. If we make acquisitions in the future, we may\nnot be able to successfully integrate the acquired businesses or technologies into our existing business, we could assume unknown or contingent liabilities and we could be forced to record significant write-offs or incur debt as a result of the acquisitions, any of which could harm our operating results. Further, integration of an acquired business or technology could require management and capital resources that otherwise would be available for ongoing development of our existing business or pursuit of other opportunities. If we pursue partnerships with pharmaceutical companies, our ability to establish and maintain these partnerships could be challenging due to several factors, including competition with other genetic testing companies and internal and external constraints placed on pharmaceutical organizations that limit the number and type of relationships they can establish with companies like ours. Moreover, we may not be able to identify or complete any acquisition, investment, technology license, joint venture or strategic relationship in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis or at all, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any such transaction sufficiently to recoup our costs.\nTo finance any acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or strategic relationships, we may seek to raise additional funds through securities offerings, credit facilities, asset sales or collaborations or licensing arrangements. Each of these methods of fundraising is subject to a variety of risks, including those discussed above under \u201cOur inability to obtain additional capital when needed and on acceptable terms in the future may limit our ability to execute our business plan.\u201d Further, additional funds may not be available when needed, on acceptable terms or at all. We may also seek to fund these transactions with issuances of our capital stock, even if the price of our common stock is low or volatile, which would involve risks associated with capital-raising equity offerings, including dilution to existing stockholders and the possible decline of the market price of our common stock. Any inability to fund acquisitions, investments or strategic relationships could cause us to forfeit opportunities that we believe to be promising or valuable, which could harm our prospects.\nWe depend on our information technology systems and any failure of these systems, due to hardware or software failures, delays in operation, failures to implement new or enhanced systems or cybersecurity breaches, could harm our business.\nWe depend on information technology and telecommunications systems for significant elements of our operations, such as our laboratory information management systems, including test validation, specimen tracking and quality control, our bioinformatics analytical software systems, our expansive reference library of information relating to genetic variants and their role in disease, personal information storage, maintenance and transmission, our customer-facing web-based software and customer service, our report production systems and our billing and reimbursement, research and development, scientific and medical data analysis and general administrative activities, including our disclosure controls, internal control over financial reporting and other public reporting functions. In addition, our third-party service providers depend upon technology and telecommunications systems in order to provide the contracted services for us. Now that we are a public company, we expect to expand and strengthen a number of enterprise software systems that affect a broad range of business processes and functions, including for example, systems handling human resources, financial and other disclosure controls and reporting, customer relationship management, regulatory compliance, security controls and other infrastructure operations.\nInformation technology and telecommunications systems are vulnerable to disruption and damage from a variety of sources, including power outages and other telecommunications or network failures, natural disasters, the outbreak of war or acts of terrorism. Moreover, despite network security and back-up measures, our servers and other electronic systems are potentially vulnerable to cybersecurity breaches, such as physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptive events. Despite the precautionary measures we have taken to detect and prevent or solve problems that could affect our information technology and telecommunications systems, there may be failures or significant downtime of these systems or those used by our third-party service providers. Any such failure or downtime could prevent us from conducting tests, preparing and providing reports to customers, billing payors, handling customer inquiries, conducting research and development activities, maintaining our financial and disclosure controls and other reporting functions and managing the administrative aspects of our business. Moreover, any such failure or downtime could force us to transfer data collection operations to an alternate provider of server-hosting services, which could involve significant costs and could result in further delays in our ability to conduct tests, deliver reports to our customers and otherwise manage our operations. Any such disruption or loss of information technology or telecommunications systems on which critical aspects of our operations depend could have a material adverse effect on our business and our reputation.\nAdditionally, as our business grows, we will need to continually improve and expand the scope of our technology systems in order to maintain adequate systems for the scale of our operations. Any failure to make such improvements or any significant delay in the planned delivery of new systems or system enhancements could render our systems obsolete or inadequate, in which case our service to our customers and our other business activities could suffer and we could be more vulnerable to electronic breaches from outside sources.\nAlthough we carry property and business interruption insurance, the coverage may not be adequate to compensate for all losses that may occur in the event of any system failures.\nWe rely on commercial courier delivery services to transport specimens to our laboratory facility in a timely and cost-efficient manner, and if these delivery services are disrupted, our business would be harmed.\nOur business depends on our ability to quickly and reliably deliver test results to our customers. Specimens are typically received within days for analysis at our Temple City, California laboratory. Disruptions in delivery service, whether due to labor disruptions, bad weather, natural disaster, terrorist acts or threats or for other reasons could adversely affect specimen integrity and our ability to process specimens in a timely manner and otherwise service our customers, and ultimately our reputation and our business. In addition, if we are unable to continue to obtain expedited delivery services on commercially reasonable terms, our operating results may be adversely affected.\nRegulatory Risks\nAny changes in laws, regulations or the enforcement discretion of the FDA with respect to the marketing of diagnostic products, or violations of laws or regulations by us, could adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe laws and regulations governing the marketing of diagnostic products are evolving, extremely complex and in many instances there are no significant regulatory or judicial interpretations of these laws and regulations. Pursuant to its authority under the FDC Act, the FDA has jurisdiction over medical devices, including our tests. Among other things, pursuant to the FDC Act and its implementing regulations, the FDA regulates the research, testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, premarket clearance or approval, marketing and promotion, and sales and distribution of medical devices in the United States to ensure that medical products distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses. In addition, the FDA regulates the import and export of medical devices.\nAlthough the FDA has statutory authority to assure that medical devices, including our tests, are safe and effective for their intended uses, the FDA has historically exercised its enforcement discretion and not enforced applicable provisions of the FDC Act and regulations with respect to LDTs, which are a particular type of medical device. We believe our tests are LDTs. As a result, we believe our tests are not currently subject to the FDA\u2019s enforcement of its medical device regulations and the applicable FDC Act provisions.\nEven though we commercialize our tests as LDTs, our tests may in the future become subject to more onerous regulation by the FDA. For example, the FDA may disagree with our assessment that our tests fall within the definition of an LDT and seek to regulate our tests as medical devices. Moreover, the FDA has issued certain guidance stating that it intends to modify its policy of enforcement discretion with respect to LDTs and begin to enforce its medical device requirements, including premarket submission requirements, for LDTs that have historically been marketed without FDA premarket review and oversight. Subsequently, the FDA solicited public input and published two draft guidance documents relating to FDA oversight of NGS-based tests. These two draft guidance documents describe the FDA\u2019s thinking and proposed approach regarding the possible use of FDA-recognized standards to support analytical validity, and public human genetic variant databases to support clinical validity, of these tests. Until the FDA finalizes its guidance regarding LDTs and NGS-based tests, it is unknown how the FDA may regulate our tests in the future and what testing and data may be required to support any required clearance or approval.\nIf the FDA begins to enforce its medical device requirements for LDTs or if the FDA disagrees with our assessment that our tests are LDTs, we could for the first time be subject to enforcement of a variety of regulatory requirements, including registration and listing, medical device reporting and quality control, and we could be required to obtain premarket clearance or approval for our existing tests and any new tests we may develop, which may force us to cease marketing our tests until we obtain the required clearance or approval. The premarket review process can be lengthy, expensive, time-consuming and unpredictable. Further, obtaining pre-market clearance may involve, among other things, successfully completing clinical trials. Clinical trials require significant time and cash resources and are subject to a high degree of risk, including risks of experiencing delays, failing to complete the trial or obtaining unexpected or negative results. If we are required to obtain premarket clearance or approval and/or conduct premarket clinical trials, our development costs could significantly increase, our introduction of any new tests we may develop may be delayed and sales of our existing tests could be interrupted or stopped. Any of these outcomes could reduce our revenue or increase our costs and materially adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition. Moreover, any cleared or approved labeling claims may not be consistent with our current claims or adequate to support continued adoption of and reimbursement for our tests. For instance, if we are required by the FDA to label our tests as investigational, or if labeling claims the FDA allows us to make are limited, order levels may decline and reimbursement may be adversely affected. As a result, we could experience significantly increased development costs and a delay in generating additional revenue from our existing tests or from tests we may develop.\nIn addition, while we qualify all materials used in our products in accordance with CLIA regulations and guidelines, the FDA could promulgate regulations or guidance documents impacting our ability to purchase materials necessary for the performance of our tests. If any of the reagents we obtain from suppliers and use in our tests are affected by future regulatory actions, our business could\nbe adversely affected, including by increasing the cost of testing or delaying, limiting or prohibiting the purchase of reagents necessary to perform testing with our products.\nFailure to comply with any applicable FDA requirements could trigger a range of enforcement actions by the FDA, including warning letters, civil monetary penalties, injunctions, criminal prosecution, recall or seizure, operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of operations and denial of or challenges to applications for clearance or approval, as well as significant adverse publicity.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable federal, state, local and foreign laboratory licensing requirements, we could lose the ability to perform our tests or experience disruptions to our business.\nWe are subject to CLIA, a federal law that establishes quality standards for all laboratory testing and is intended to ensure the accuracy, reliability and timeliness of patient results. CLIA requires that we hold a certificate specific to the laboratory examinations we perform and that we comply with various standards with respect to personnel qualifications, facility administration, proficiency testing, quality control, quality assurance and inspections. CLIA certification is required in order for us to be eligible to bill federal and state healthcare programs, as well as many private third-party payors, for our tests. We have obtained CLIA certification to conduct our tests at our laboratory in Temple City, California. To renew this certification, we are subject to survey and inspection every two years and we may be subject to additional unannounced inspections.\nWe are also required to maintain a license to conduct testing in the State of California. California laws establish standards for day-to-day operation of our clinical reference laboratory in Temple City, including with respect to the training and skills required of personnel, quality control and proficiency testing requirements. In addition, certain other states require us to maintain out-of-state laboratory licenses or obtain approval on a test-specific basis to perform testing on specimens from these states. Additional states could adopt similar licensure requirements in the future, which could require us to modify, delay or discontinue our operations in such jurisdictions. We are also subject to regulation in foreign jurisdictions, which we expect will increase as we seek to expand international utilization of our tests or if jurisdictions in which we pursue operations adopt new or modified licensure requirements. Foreign licensure requirements could require review and modification of our tests in order to offer them in certain jurisdictions or could impose other limitations, such as restrictions on the transport of human blood or other tissue necessary for us to perform our tests that may limit our ability to make our tests available outside of the United States. Additionally, complying with licensure requirements in new jurisdictions may be expensive, time-consuming and subject us to significant and unanticipated delays.\nFailure to comply with applicable clinical laboratory licensure requirements could result in a range of enforcement actions, including license suspension, limitation or revocation, directed plan of correction, onsite monitoring, civil monetary penalties, civil injunctive suits, criminal sanctions and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, as well as significant adverse publicity. Any sanction imposed under CLIA, its implementing regulations or state or foreign laws or regulations governing clinical laboratory licensure, or our failure to renew our CLIA certificate or any other required local, state or foreign license or accreditation, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In such case, even if we were able to bring our laboratory back into compliance, we could incur significant expenses and lose revenue while doing so.\nIn addition to CLIA requirements, we elect to participate in CAP accreditation. CMS has deemed CAP standards to be equally or more stringent than CLIA regulations and has approved CAP as a recognized accrediting organization. Inspection by CAP is performed in lieu of inspection by CMS for CAP-accredited laboratories. Because we are accredited by the CAP Laboratory Accreditation Program, we are deemed to also comply with CLIA. While not required to operate a CLIA-certified laboratory, many private insurers require CAP accreditation as a condition to contracting with clinical laboratories to cover their tests. In addition, some countries outside the United States require CAP accreditation as a condition to permitting clinical laboratories to test samples taken from their citizens. Failure to maintain CAP accreditation could have a material adverse effect on the sales of our tests and the results of our operations.\nWe are subject to broad legal requirements regarding the information we test and analyze and any failure to comply with these requirements could result in harsh penalties, damage our reputation and materially harm our business.\nOur business is subject to federal and state laws that protect the privacy and security of personal health information, including HIPAA, HITECH and similar state laws.\nNumerous other federal, state and foreign laws, including consumer protection laws and regulations, govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality and security of patient health information. In addition, new laws and regulations that further protect the privacy and security of medical records or medical information are regularly considered by federal and state governments. Further, with the recent increase in publicity regarding data breaches resulting in improper dissemination of consumer information, federal and state governments have passed or are considering laws regulating the actions that a business must take if it experiences a data breach, such as prompt disclosure to affected customers. The Federal Trade Commission and states\u2019 Attorneys General have also brought enforcement actions and prosecuted some data breach cases as unfair and/or deceptive acts or practices\nunder the Federal Trade Commission Act. In addition to data breach notification laws, some states have enacted statutes and rules requiring businesses to reasonably protect certain types of personal information they hold or to otherwise comply with certain specified data security requirements for personal information. We intend to continue to comprehensively protect all personal information and to comply with all applicable laws regarding the protection of such information.\nAny failure to implement appropriate security measures to protect the confidentiality and integrity of personal information or any breach or other failure of these systems resulting in the unauthorized access, manipulation, disclosure or loss of this information could result in our noncompliance with these laws. Penalties for failure to comply with a requirement of HIPAA and HITECH vary significantly depending on the failure and could include civil monetary or criminal penalties.\nIn addition, the interpretation, application and interplay of consumer and health-related data protection laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain, contradictory and in flux. As a result, it is possible that laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our current practices. Moreover, these laws and their interpretations are constantly evolving and they may become more stringent over time. Complying with these laws or any new laws or interpretations of their application could involve significant time and substantial costs or require us to change our business practices and compliance procedures in a manner adverse to our business. We may not be able to obtain or maintain compliance with the diverse privacy and security requirements in all of the jurisdictions in which we currently or plan to do business, and failure to comply with any of these requirements could result in civil or criminal penalties, harm our reputation and materially adversely affect our business.\nWe conduct business in a heavily regulated industry. Complying with the numerous statutes and regulations pertaining to our business is expensive and time-consuming, and any failure by us, our consultants or commercial partners to comply could result in substantial penalties.\nOur industry is heavily regulated, and the regulatory environment in which we operate could change significantly and adversely in the future. Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, all of which are subject to change. These laws and regulations currently include, among others:\n\u2022\nthe FDA\u2019s enforcement discretion with respect to LDTs;\n\u2022\nCLIA\u2019s and CAP\u2019s regulation of our laboratory activities;\n\u2022\nfederal and state laws and standards affecting reimbursement by government payors, including certain coding requirements to obtain reimbursement and certain changes to the payment mechanism for clinical laboratory services resulting from PAMA;\n\u2022\nHIPAA and HITECH, which establish comprehensive federal standards with respect to the privacy and security of PHI, and requirements for the use of certain standardized electronic transactions with respect to transmission of such information;\n\u2022\nstate laws governing the maintenance of personally identifiable information of state residents, including medical information, and which impose varying breach notification requirements, some of which allow private rights of action by individuals for violations and also impose penalties for such violations;\n\u2022\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which generally prohibits knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in return for or to induce a person to refer to an individual any good, facility, item or service that is reimbursable under a federal healthcare program;\n\u2022\nthe federal Stark Law, which generally prohibits a physician from making a referral for certain designated health services covered by the Medicare program, including laboratory and pathology services, if the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship with the entity providing the designated health services;\n\u2022\nthe federal false claims laws, which generally impose liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the federal government;\n\u2022\nthe federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which generally prohibits, among other things, the offering or transfer of remuneration to a Medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary if it is likely to influence the beneficiary\u2019s selection of a particular provider, practitioner or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state healthcare program;\n\u2022\nthe Affordable Care Act, which, among other things, establishes a requirement for providers and suppliers to report and return any overpayments received from government payors under the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u2022\nother federal and state fraud and abuse laws, such as anti-kickback laws, prohibitions on self-referral, fee-splitting restrictions, insurance fraud laws, anti-markup laws, prohibitions on the provision of tests at no or discounted cost to induce physician or patient adoption and false claims acts, some of which may extend to services reimbursable by any third-party payor, including private insurers;\n\u2022\nthe federal Physician Sunshine Payment Act and various state laws on reporting relationships with healthcare providers and customers, which could be determined to apply to our LDTs;\n\u2022\nthe prohibition on reassignment of Medicare claims;\n\u2022\nstate laws that prohibit other specified practices, such as billing physicians for tests that they order, waiving coinsurance, copayments, deductibles and other amounts owed by patients, business corporations practicing medicine or employing or engaging physicians to practice medicine and billing a state Medicaid program at a price that is higher than what is charged to one or more other payors;\n\u2022\nthe FCPA and other applicable anti-bribery laws;\n\u2022\nfederal, state and local regulations relating to the handling and disposal of regulated medical waste, hazardous waste and biohazardous waste and workplace safety for healthcare employees; and\n\u2022\nsimilar foreign laws and regulations that apply to us in the countries in which we operate or may operate in the future.\nThe growth of our business generally and our intent to grow our international business, as well as our use of consultants and commercial partners may increase the potential of violating these laws. Our risk of violating these or other laws and regulations is further increased because of the lack of their complete interpretation by applicable regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are thus open to a variety of interpretations.\nWe have adopted policies and procedures designed to comply with these laws and regulations and, in the ordinary course of our business, we conduct internal reviews of our compliance with these laws. Our compliance is also subject to review by applicable government agencies. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees, distributors, consultants and commercial partners, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from government investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations. Additionally, we are subject to the risk that a person or government could allege such fraud or other misconduct, even if none occurred. Any action brought against us for violation of these or other laws or regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business and harm our reputation. If our operations, including the conduct of our employees, distributors, consultants and commercial partners, are found to be in violation of any of these laws and regulations, we may be subject to applicable penalties associated with the violation, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, individual imprisonment, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, refunding of payments received by us and curtailment or cessation of our operations. Any of these consequences could seriously harm our business and our financial results.\nHealthcare policy changes, including recently enacted legislation reforming the U.S. healthcare system, could cause significant harm to our business, operations and financial condition.\nThe Affordable Care Act made a number of substantial changes to the way healthcare is financed both by governmental and private insurers. For example, the Affordable Care Act requires each medical device manufacturer to pay a sales tax on the medical devices it sells. It is unclear at this time when, or if, the provision of our LDTs will trigger the medical device tax if the FDA ends its policy of general enforcement discretion and regulates certain LDTs as medical devices, and it is possible that this tax will apply to some or all of our existing tests or tests we may develop in the future. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act introduces mechanisms to reduce the per capita rate of growth in Medicare spending if expenditures exceed certain targets. Any such reductions could affect reimbursement payments for our tests. The Affordable Care Act also contains a number of other provisions, including provisions governing enrollment in federal and state healthcare programs, reimbursement matters and fraud and abuse, which we expect will impact our industry and our operations in ways that we cannot currently predict.\nIn April 2014, Congress passed PAMA, which included substantial changes to the way in which clinical laboratory services will be paid under Medicare. Under PAMA, certain clinical laboratories are required to periodically report to CMS private payor payment rates and volumes for their tests. Laboratories that fail to report the required payment information may be subject to substantial civil monetary penalties. As required under PAMA, CMS will use the rates and volumes reported by laboratories to develop Medicare payment rates for laboratory tests equal to the volume-weighted median of the private payor payment rates for the tests. The impact of this new payment system on rates for our tests, including any current or future tests we may develop, is uncertain.\nWe cannot predict whether or when these or other recently enacted healthcare initiatives will be implemented at the federal or state level or how any such legislation or regulation may affect us. For instance, the payment reductions imposed by the Affordable Care Act and the changes to reimbursement amounts paid by Medicare for tests such as ours based on the procedure set forth in PAMA, could limit the prices we will be able to charge or the amount of available reimbursement for our tests, which would reduce our revenue. Additionally, these healthcare policy changes could be amended or additional healthcare initiatives could be implemented in the future. For instance, there is uncertainty regarding the continued effect or the Affordable Care Act in its current form following\nthe results of the 2016 U.S. presidential election and in light of the policies of the current administration, which has threatened to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Further, the impact on our business of the expansion of the federal and state governments\u2019 role in the U.S. healthcare industry generally including the social, governmental and other pressures to reduce healthcare costs while expanding individual benefits, is uncertain. Any future changes or initiatives could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we use hazardous materials in a manner that causes contamination or injury, we could be liable for resulting damages.\nOur activities require the use of regulated medical waste, hazardous waste and biohazardous waste, including chemicals, biological agents and compounds, blood and other tissue specimens. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury to employees or third parties from the use, storage, handling or disposal of these materials. In the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources or any applicable insurance coverage we may have secured. Additionally, we are subject on an ongoing basis to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. Although we typically use outside vendors to dispose of such waste that are licensed or otherwise qualified to handle and dispose of the waste, applicable laws and regulations may hold us liable for damages and fines as a result of others\u2019 actions should contamination of the environment or individual exposure to hazardous substances occur. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations could become significant and our failure to comply could result in substantial fines or other consequences, any of which could negatively affect our operating results and significantly harm our reputation.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA and other anti-bribery laws.\nOur international operations are subject to various anti-bribery laws, including the FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws in the non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we operate. The FCPA prohibits companies and their intermediaries from offering, making, or authorizing improper payments to non-U.S. or foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or securing any other improper advantage. These laws are complex and far-reaching in nature, and we may be required in the future to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws or any changes to these laws or their interpretation.\nWe currently engage in significant business outside of the United States, and we plan to increase our international operations in the future. These operations could involve dealings with governments, foreign officials and state-owned entities, such as government hospitals, outside of the United States. In addition, we may engage distributors, partners or third-party intermediaries, such as representatives, contractors, and agents, to assist with promotion and sale of our tests abroad and to obtain necessary permits, licenses, and other regulatory approvals. Any such third parties could be deemed to be our agents and we could be held responsible for any corrupt or other illegal activities of our employees or these third parties, even if we do not explicitly authorize or have actual knowledge of such activities. We have instituted policies, procedures, and internal controls reasonably designed to promote compliance with the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws and we exercise a high degree of vigilance in maintaining, implementing and enforcing these policies and controls. However, these policies and controls could be circumvented or ignored and they cannot guarantee compliance with these laws and regulations. Any violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our operations, involve significant management distraction, involve significant costs and expenses, including legal fees, and harm our reputation. Additionally, other U.S. companies in the medical device and pharmaceutical fields have faced substantial fines and criminal penalties in the recent past for violating the FCPA, and we could also incur these types of penalties, including criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement, and other remedial measures, if we violate the FCPA or other applicable anti-bribery laws. Any of these outcomes could result in a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur services present the potential for embezzlement, identity theft or other similar illegal behavior by our employees, consultants or commercial partners.\nOur operations involve the use and disclosure of personal and business information that could be used to impersonate third parties or otherwise gain access to their data or funds. If any of our employees, consultants or commercial partners takes, converts or misuses such funds, documents or data, we could be liable for damages, and our business reputation could be damaged or destroyed.\nIntellectual Property Risks\nWe currently own no patent applications related to our technology platform and rely upon trade secret protection, non-disclosure agreements and invention assignment agreements to protect our proprietary information, which may not be effective to protect our proprietary technologies and other information.\nWe currently rely upon trade secret protection, non-disclosure agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants and third-parties to protect our confidential and proprietary information. Although our competitors have utilized and are expected to continue to utilize similar methods and have aggregated and are expected to continue to aggregate similar\nlibraries of genetic testing information, our success will depend upon our ability to develop proprietary methods and libraries and to defend any advantages afforded to us by such methods and libraries relative to our competitors. If we do not protect our intellectual property adequately, competitors may be able to use our proprietary technologies and information and thereby erode any competitive advantages they provide us.\nWe will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies are effectively maintained as trade secrets. We expect to rely primarily upon trade secret and proprietary know-how protection for our confidential and proprietary information and we have taken security measures to protect this information. These measures, however, may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other confidential information. Among other things, we seek to protect our trade secrets and other confidential information by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants and other third parties. These confidentiality agreements may not sufficiently safeguard our trade secrets and confidential information and may not provide adequate remedies in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret can be difficult, expensive and time-consuming and the outcome could be unpredictable. In addition, trade secrets or other confidential information could otherwise become known or be independently developed by others in a manner that could prevent legal recourse by us. If any of our trade secrets or other confidential or proprietary information were to be disclosed or misappropriated or if any such information was independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position could be harmed and our business could suffer.\nLitigation or other proceedings or third-party claims of intellectual property infringement or misappropriation could require us to spend significant time and money and could prevent us from selling our tests.\nOur commercial success will depend in part upon our ability to avoid infringement of patents and other proprietary rights owned by third parties, including the intellectual property rights of competitors. There are numerous U.S. and foreign patents and pending patent applications and other intellectual property rights that cover technologies relevant to genetic testing and that are owned by third parties. We may be unaware of patents or other intellectual property rights that a third-party might assert are infringed by our business and there may be patent applications that, if issued, could be asserted against us. As a result, our existing or future operations may be found or alleged to infringe existing or future patents or other intellectual property rights of others. As we continue to sell our existing tests, launch new tests and enter new markets, competitors may claim that our tests infringe or misappropriate their intellectual property rights as part of strategies designed to impede our successful entry into new markets.\nIf a patent infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property suit were brought against us, we could be forced to discontinue or delay our development or sales of any tests or other activities that are the subject of the suit while it is pending. Additionally, defense of these claims, regardless of merit, could cause us to incur substantial expenses, be a substantial diversion of our management and other employee resources and significantly harm our reputation. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may be forced to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees if we are found to have willfully infringed patents, obtain one or more licenses, which may not be available when needed, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, pay royalties, which may be substantial, or redesign any infringing tests or other activities, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. Further, third parties making claims against us for infringement or misappropriation of their patents or other intellectual property rights could seek and obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which, if granted, could prohibit us from performing our tests. Any of these outcomes could delay our introduction of new tests, significantly increase our costs or prevent us from conducting certain of our essential activities, which could materially adversely affect our ability to operate and grow our business.\nDevelopments in patent law could have a negative impact on our business.\nFrom time to time, the U.S. Supreme Court, other federal courts, the U.S. Congress or the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, may change the standards of patentability, and any such changes could have a negative impact on our business.\nThree cases involving diagnostic method claims and \u201cgene patents\u201d have recently been decided by the Supreme Court. In March 2012, the Supreme Court issued a decision in Mayo Collaborative v. Prometheus Laboratories, or Prometheus, a case involving patent claims directed to optimizing the amount of drug administered to a specific patient, holding that the applicable patents\u2019 claims failed to incorporate sufficient inventive content above and beyond mere underlying natural correlations to allow the claimed processes to qualify as patent-eligible processes that apply natural laws. In June 2013, the Supreme Court decided Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, or Myriad, a case challenging the validity of patent claims relating to the breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2, holding that isolated genomic DNA that exists in nature, such as the DNA constituting the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, is not patentable subject matter, but that cDNA, which is an artificial construct created from RNA transcripts of genes, may be patent eligible. In June 2014, the Supreme Court decided Alice Corporation Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank International, or Alice, which affirmed the Prometheus and Myriad decisions and provided additional interpretation.\nIf we make efforts to seek patent protection for our technology and tests, these efforts may be negatively impacted by the Prometheus, Myriad and Alice decisions, rulings in other cases or guidance or procedures issued by the USPTO. However, we cannot fully predict the impact of the Prometheus, Myriad and Alice decisions on the ability of genetic testing, biopharmaceutical or other companies to obtain or enforce patents relating to DNA, genes or genomic-related discoveries in the future, as the contours of when claims reciting laws of nature, natural phenomena or abstract ideas may meet patent eligibility requirements are not clear and may take years to develop via interpretation at the USPTO and in the courts. There are many previously issued patents claiming nucleic acids and diagnostic methods based on natural correlations that issued before these recent Supreme Court decisions and, although many of these patents may be invalid under the standards set forth in these decisions, these patents are presumed valid and enforceable until they are successfully challenged, and third parties holding these patents could allege that we infringe or request that we obtain a license under these patents. Whether based on patents issued prior to or after these Supreme Court decisions, we could be forced to defend against claims of patent infringement or obtain license rights, if available, under these patents. In particular, although the Supreme Court has held in Myriad that isolated genomic DNA is not patent-eligible subject matter, third parties could allege that our activities infringe other classes of gene-related patent claims. There are numerous risks associated with any patent infringement claim against us, which are discussed above under \u201c-Litigation or other proceedings or third-party claims of intellectual property infringement or misappropriation could require us to spend significant time and money and could prevent us from selling our tests.\u201d\nIn addition, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or America Invents Act, which was signed into law in 2011, includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These changes include a transition from a \u201cfirst-to-invent\u201d system to a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system, changes to the way issued patents are challenged and changes to the way patent applications are disputed during the examination process. These changes may favor larger and more established companies that have greater resources to devote to patent application filing and prosecution. The USPTO has developed new regulations and procedures to govern the full implementation of the America Invents Act, but the impact of the America Invents Act on the cost of prosecuting any patent applications we may file, our ability to obtain patents based on our discoveries if we pursue them and our ability to enforce or defend any patents that may issue remains unclear.\nThese and other substantive changes to U.S. patent law could affect our susceptibility to patent infringement claims and our ability to obtain any patents we may pursue and, if obtained, to enforce or defend them, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may not be able to enforce our intellectual property rights outside the United States.\nThe laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States and many companies have encountered significant challenges in establishing and enforcing their proprietary rights outside the United States. These challenges can be caused by the absence of rules and methods for the establishment and enforcement of intellectual property rights in certain jurisdictions. In addition, the legal systems of some countries, particularly developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of certain intellectual property protection, especially relating to healthcare. These aspects of many foreign legal systems could make it difficult for us to stop the misappropriation of our intellectual property rights. Moreover, changes in the law and legal decisions by courts in foreign countries could affect our ability to obtain adequate protection for our technology and the enforcement of intellectual property rights. As a result, our efforts to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights in foreign countries may ultimately prove to be inadequate, in which case our ability to grow our business and our revenue and prospects could be materially harmed.\nThird parties may assert that our employees or consultants have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information or misappropriated trade secrets.\nWe employ individuals who were previously employed at universities, biometric solution or genetic testing, diagnostic or other healthcare companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees and consultants do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or our employees or consultants have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of a former employer or other third-party. Further, we may become subject to ownership disputes in the future arising from, for example, conflicting obligations of consultants or others who are involved in developing our technology and other parties\u2019 intellectual property. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, we could be subject to monetary damages and the loss of valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against any such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs, distract management and other employees and damage our reputation.\nPublic Company Risks\nWe will incur increased costs and demands as a result of compliance with laws and regulations applicable to public companies.\nAs a public company, we will experience significant additional demands that we did not experience as a private company. For example, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and related and other rules implemented by the SEC and The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC, or NASDAQ, impose a number of requirements on public companies, including with respect to corporate governance practices. For instance, as a result of becoming a public company, a majority of our directors are required to be independent and we are required to maintain audit and compensation committees comprised solely of independent directors, maintain a variety of corporate governance policies, adopt and maintain policies regarding internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures and prepare reports on internal controls over financial reporting. Until completion of the Reorganization, we operated without a board of directors under the direction of the Manager of Fulgent LLC, Mr. Hsieh. Further, the SEC and other regulators have continued to adopt new rules and regulations and make additional changes to existing regulations that require our compliance, including pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or Dodd-Frank Act, which was enacted in July 2010. There are significant corporate governance and executive compensation-related disclosure provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act that require the SEC to adopt additional rules and regulations in these areas.\nMoreover, the rules and regulations applicable to public companies will substantially increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs. For instance, we will need to hire additional personnel for, and devote more resources to, our financial reporting function. Additionally, if we continue to grow as anticipated, we will need to implement new and more sophisticated financial and accounting systems and adopt additional procedures for financial reporting in order to meet our obligations as a public company. Any transition of accounting systems can be expensive and can result in delays in our ability to process and report transactions in a timely manner. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of attention to maintaining our compliance with these obligations, which could be time-consuming and expensive. If these requirements divert the attention of our management and personnel from other aspects of our business or if they require substantial costs that we cannot afford, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We also expect that, as a public company, it will be more expensive for us to attract and compensate qualified directors and officers and obtain adequate director and officer liability insurance.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our reported financial information and the market price of our common stock could decline.\nAs a public company, we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and, beginning with our annual report for the year ended December 31, 2017, provide a management report on our internal control over financial reporting. If we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated. We have only started to implement the systems and processes necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We will need to maintain and enhance these systems, processes and controls as we grow and we may need to hire additional personnel and devote more resources to our financial reporting function in order to do so.\nDuring the process of evaluating our internal controls, if we identify one or more material weaknesses, our management will be unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. Moreover, when we are no longer an emerging growth company, our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to issue an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Even if our management concludes that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, our independent registered public accounting firm may conclude that there are material weaknesses with respect to our internal controls or the level at which our internal controls are documented, designed, implemented or reviewed.\nIf we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective or, when we are no longer an emerging growth company, our auditors were to express an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting because one or more material weaknesses had been identified or if internal control deficiencies result in the restatement of our financial results, investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial disclosures and the price of our common stock could decline.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\nAs a result of becoming a public company, we are now subject to the periodic reporting and other requirements of the Exchange Act. As a result, we have implemented disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information we must disclose in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. However, any disclosure\ncontrols and procedures, no matter how well-conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. As a result, because of these inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements or omissions due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected, which could result in failures to file required reports in a timely manner and filing reports containing incorrect information. Any of these outcomes could result in SEC enforcement actions, monetary fines or other penalties, damage to our reputation and harm to our financial condition.\nWe are an emerging growth company and may elect to comply with reduced public company reporting requirements available to emerging growth companies, which could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. We will remain an emerging growth company until December 31, 2021, unless our gross revenue exceeds $1.0 billion in any fiscal year before that date, we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt in any three-year period before that date or the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of the second fiscal quarter of any fiscal year before that date. As an emerging growth company, we are eligible for certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to certain other public companies, including exemption from the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced financial statement and other financial disclosures in registration statements we file, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation and exemption from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and obtaining stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Even after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we may still qualify as a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d which would allow us to take advantage of many of the same exemptions from disclosure requirements, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and having reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation. We have relied on many of these exemptions to date and investors may find our common stock less attractive if we choose to continue to rely on any of these exemptions, in which case there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nUnder the Securities Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption and, as a result, will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nCommon Stock Risks\nAn active, liquid trading market for our common stock may never develop, which could make it difficult for you to sell your shares of our common stock.\nPrior to the completion of our initial public offering on October 4, 2016, no public market for shares of our common stock existed. An active trading market for our shares may never develop or, if developed, may not be sustained. Further, Mr. Hsieh, our founder and Chief Executive Officer, beneficially owns approximately 43.9% of our outstanding voting equity as of the completion of our initial public offering. As a result, fewer shares are actively traded in the public market, which reduces the liquidity of the market for our common stock. The lack of an active trading market could impair your ability to sell your shares at the time you wish to sell them or at a price you consider reasonable. Further, an inactive trading market may impair our ability to raise capital in the future by selling shares of our common stock and may impair our ability to enter into strategic relationships or acquire companies or technologies using shares of our common stock as consideration.\nOur common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol \u201cFLGT.\u201d If we fail to satisfy the continued listing standards of NASDAQ, however, we could be de-listed, which would negatively impact the price of our common stock.\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe trading price of our common stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, wide fluctuations and significant volatility. This volatility may be exacerbated by the relatively small and illiquid market for our shares since the completion of our initial public offering on October 4, 2016. Other factors that may contribute to this volatility may include, among others:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\ncompetition from existing tests or new tests that may emerge;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, investments, strategic relationships, joint ventures, collaborations or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet or exceed financial estimates and projections of the investment community or guidance that we provide to the public;\n\u2022\nissuance of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts or changed recommendations for our common stock;\n\u2022\nthe timing and amount of our investments in the growth of our business;\n\u2022\ndisputes or other developments with respect to our or others\u2019 intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in laws or regulations applicable to our business or our tests;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key management or other personnel;\n\u2022\nchanges in coverage and reimbursement by current or potential payors;\n\u2022\ninability to obtain additional funding, as and when needed;\n\u2022\nproduct liability claims or other litigation;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by us or our stockholders;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, political, industry and market conditions, including factors not directly related to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors, such as increased uncertainty in the U.S. healthcare regulatory environment following the results of the 2016 U.S. presidential election; and\n\u2022\nthe other risk factors discussed in this report.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the market for stock of companies in the life sciences and technology industries in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of specific companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against the company. This type of litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nOur principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our capital stock and are able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nAs of March 1, 2017, our executive officers, directors, holders of 5% or more of our outstanding voting equity and their respective affiliates beneficially owned approximately 70.2% of our outstanding voting equity and Mr. Hsieh, our founder and Chief Executive Officer, beneficially owns approximately 43.9% of our outstanding voting equity. As a result, these stockholders have the ability to control matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including elections of directors, amendments to our organizational documents or approval of any merger, sale of assets or other major corporate transaction. This concentration of ownership may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders, as the interests of these stockholders may not coincide with your interests or the interests of other stockholders and they may act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of all stockholders. Further, this concentration of ownership could adversely affect the prevailing market price for our common stock.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could cause the price of our common stock to fall.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that such sales are pending or could occur, could reduce the market price of our common stock. As of March 16, 2017, we had 17,676,256 outstanding shares of common stock. Of these shares, approximately 3,830,000 shares of our common stock are freely tradable without restriction in the public market. The remaining outstanding shares of our common stock are restricted from sale until March 27, 2017 pursuant to the terms of certain lock-up agreements entered into in connection with our initial public offering and/or are held by our \u201caffiliates,\u201d as that term is defined in the Securities Act, and constitute restricted securities under the Securities Act. Generally, restricted securities may not be sold in the public market unless the sale is registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from registration is available.\nMoreover, Xi Long, which holds an aggregate of 2,025,623 shares of our common stock, has the right, subject to certain conditions, to include its shares in registration statements we may file for ourselves or other stockholders and to require us to file registration statements covering its shares following May 16, 2019. We have also registered the shares of our common stock that we\nmay issue under our 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan, or the 2016 Plan, totaling 591,112 shares subject to options outstanding as of December 31, 2016 and 1,482,727 additional shares reserved for issuance under the 2016 Plan. As a result, these shares will be freely tradable in the public market upon issuance, subject to volume and manner of sale limitations applicable to affiliates and any other legal and contractual limitations.\nFuture issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase our common stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans, could result in additional dilution to the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause the price of our common stock to fall.\nTo raise capital in the future, we may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities, our then-existing stockholders could be materially diluted by such issuances and new investors could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to the holders of our common stock, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock, so any returns will be limited to the value of our common stock.\nWe currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business. As a result, we do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends or other distributions for the foreseeable future. Further, if we were to enter into a credit facility or issue debt securities or preferred equity securities in the future, we may be contractually restricted from paying dividends. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because stockholders must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, to realize any future gains on their investment.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our common stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nIf a trading market for our common stock develops, that trading market will be influenced to some extent by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. We have only recently obtained research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause the price and trading volume of our common stock to decline. Further, if any of these analysts issues an adverse or misleading opinion regarding us, our business model, our industry or our stock performance or if our operating results fail to meet analyst expectations, the price of our common stock could significantly decline.\nProvisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management and depress the market price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions, among other things:\n\u2022\nauthorize our board of directors to issue, without further action by our stockholders, up to 1,000,000 shares of undesignated or \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, thus requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a duly noticed and held meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nspecify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our board of directors, the Chairman of our board of directors or our President, thereby eliminating the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings;\n\u2022\npermit only the board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill vacancies on the board of directors, except as may be required by law;\n\u2022\npermit the board of directors to amend our bylaws, subject to the power of our stockholders to repeal any such amendment;\n\u2022\ndo not permit cumulative voting on the election of directors; and\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for stockholders to propose nominees for election as directors or matters to be acted upon at annual meetings of stockholders.\nIn addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL, which may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. Section 203 imposes certain restrictions on mergers, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15% or more of our common stock.\nHolders of our common stock could be adversely affected if we issue preferred stock.\nPursuant to our certificate of incorporation, our board of directors is authorized to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock without any action on the part of our stockholders. Our board of directors will also have the power, without stockholder approval, to set the terms of any series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights, preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends or in the event of a dissolution, liquidation or winding up and other terms. In the event that we issue preferred stock in the future that has preferences over our common stock with respect to payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if we issue preferred stock that is convertible into our common stock at greater than a one-to-one ratio, the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock or the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nOur certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for:\n\u2022\nany derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\n\u2022\nany action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or to our stockholders;\n\u2022\nany action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws; or\n\u2022\nany action asserting a claim against us governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to this provision of our certificate of incorporation. This choice-of-forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.", "PERMNO": 16290, "SIC": 8071, "TIC": "FLGT"}
