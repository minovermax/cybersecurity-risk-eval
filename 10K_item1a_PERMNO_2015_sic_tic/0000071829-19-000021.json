Risk Factors\nThe following summarizes the most significant risk factors to our business. In addition to these risks, we are subject to a variety of risks that affect many other companies generally, as well as other risks and uncertainties that are not known to us as of the date of this Annual Report. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks. Any of these risk factors, either individually or in combination, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition, or prevent us from meeting our profitability or growth objectives. If you hold our securities or are considering an investment in our securities, you should carefully consider the following risks, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report.\nRisks Related to the Worldwide Oil and Natural Gas Industry\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from customers in the worldwide oil and natural gas industry; therefore, our risk factors include those factors that impact the demand for oil and natural gas. Spending by our customers for exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas is based on a number of factors, including expectations of future hydrocarbon demand, energy prices, the risks associated with developing reserves, our customers' ability to finance exploration and development of reserves, regulatory developments, and the future value of the reserves. Reductions in customer spending levels adversely affect the demand for our products and services, and consequently, our revenues and operating results. The key risk factors that we believe influence the worldwide oil and natural gas markets are discussed below.\nDemand for oil and natural gas is subject to factors beyond our control\nDemand for oil and natural gas, as well as the demand for our products and services, is highly correlated with global economic growth and in particular by the economic growth of countries such as the U.S., India, China, and developing countries in Asia and the Middle East. Weakness in global economic activity could reduce demand for oil and natural gas and result in lower oil and natural gas prices. In addition, demand for oil and natural gas could be impacted by environmental regulations, including cap and trade legislation, regulation of hydraulic fracturing, and carbon taxes. Weakness or deterioration of the global economy could reduce our customers\u2019 spending levels and could reduce our revenues and operating results.\nSupply of oil and natural gas is subject to factors beyond our control\nSupply of oil and natural gas can be affected by the availability of quality drilling prospects, exploration success, and the number and productivity of new wells drilled and completed, as well as the rate of production and resulting depletion of existing wells. Oil and natural gas storage inventory levels are indicators of the relative balance between supply and demand. In recent years, advancements in drilling and completion methods and technologies have contributed to a significant increase in oil production, particularly in the U.S. market. Supply can also be impacted by the degree to which individual Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) nations and other large oil and natural gas producing countries are willing and able to control production and exports of hydrocarbons, to decrease or increase supply, and to support their targeted oil price or meet market share objectives. Any of these factors could affect the supply of oil and natural gas and could have a material effect on our results of operations.\nVolatility of oil and natural gas prices can adversely affect demand for our products and services\nVolatility in oil and natural gas prices can also impact our customers\u2019 activity levels and spending for our products and services. The level of energy prices is important to the cash flow for our customers and their ability to fund exploration and development activities. Expectations about future commodity prices and price volatility are important for determining future spending levels. Our customers also take into account the volatility of energy prices and other risk factors by requiring higher returns for individual projects if there is higher perceived risk.\nOur customers\u2019 activity levels, spending for our products and services, and ability to pay amounts owed us could be impacted by the ability of our customers to access equity or credit markets\nOur customers\u2019 access to capital is dependent on their ability to access the funds necessary to develop oil and natural gas prospects. In recent years, limited access to external sources of funding has, at times, caused customers to reduce their capital spending plans. In addition, a reduction of cash flow to our customers resulting from declines in commodity prices or the lack of available debt or equity financing may impact the ability of our customers to pay amounts owed to us.\nA heightened focus by our customers on cost-saving measures rather than the quality of products and services, which is one of the ways we seek to differentiate ourselves from our competition, could reduce the demand for our products and services\nOur customers are continually seeking to implement measures aimed at greater cost savings, which may include the acceptance of lesser quality products and services in order to improve short term cost efficiencies as opposed to total cost efficiencies. The continued implementation of these kinds of cost saving measures could reduce the demand or pricing for our products and services and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Customer Concentration and Reliance on the U.S. Exploration and Production Market\nIn 2018, approximately 44% of our consolidated revenues were derived from our 20 largest customers, although no customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues. While we are not dependent on any one customer or group of customers, the loss of one or more of our significant customers could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, approximately 66% of our consolidated revenues were derived from our U.S. operations, including approximately $500 million from the exploration and production market.\nBeginning late 2014 and continuing through early 2016, the price of oil declined dramatically from the price levels in prior years. Following this decline, North American drilling activity decreased significantly, which reduced the demand for our services and negatively impacted customer pricing in our North American operations, relative to pre-downturn levels. Oil prices and drilling activity have since improved from the lows reached in early 2016, but remain lower than pre-downturn levels and continue to be volatile, and there are no assurances that the price for oil or activity levels will not experience a significant decline again in the future. Due in part to these changes, our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated significantly and may continue to fluctuate in future periods. Because our business has substantial fixed costs, including significant facility and personnel expenses, downtime or low productivity due to reduced demand could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWhile diversification into non-oil and natural gas markets is intended over the long term to grow the business and offset the cyclical nature of the underlying oil and natural gas business, we cannot be certain of the diversification benefits associated with those lines of business.\nRisks Related to International Operations\nWe have significant operations outside of the U.S., including Canada and certain areas of Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, and Asia Pacific. In 2018, these international operations generated approximately 34% of our consolidated revenues. Substantially all of our cash balance at December 31, 2018 resides within our international subsidiaries. Algeria represented our largest international market with our total Algerian operations representing 9% of our consolidated revenues for 2018 and 8% of our total assets at December 31, 2018, including 22% of our total cash balance at December 31, 2018.\nIn addition, we may seek to expand to other areas outside the U.S. in the future. International operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u25aa\ndifficulties and cost associated with complying with a wide variety of complex foreign laws, treaties, and regulations;\n\u25aa\nuncertainties in or unexpected changes in regulatory environments or tax laws;\n\u25aa\nlegal uncertainties, timing delays, and expenses associated with tariffs, export licenses, and other trade barriers;\n\u25aa\ndifficulties enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems;\n\u25aa\nrisks associated with failing to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, export laws, and other similar laws applicable to our operations in international markets;\n\u25aa\nexchange controls or other limitations on international currency movements, including restrictions on the repatriation of funds to the U.S. from certain countries;\n\u25aa\nsanctions imposed by the U.S. government that prevent us from engaging in business in certain countries or with certain counter-parties;\n\u25aa\ninability to obtain or preserve certain intellectual property rights in the foreign countries in which we operate;\n\u25aa\nour inexperience in certain international markets;\n\u25aa\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u25aa\npolitical and economic instability; and\n\u25aa\nacts of terrorism.\nIn addition, several North African markets in which we operate, including Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, and Algeria have experienced social and political unrest in past years, which, when they occur, negatively impact our operating results and can include the temporary suspension of our operations.\nRisks Related to Our Ability to Attract, Retain, and Develop Qualified Leaders, Key Employees, and Skilled Personnel\nOur failure to attract, retain, and develop qualified leaders and key employees at our corporate, divisional, or regional headquarters could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, all of our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly-skilled engineers, technical sales personnel, and service personnel. In recent years, the labor market in the U.S. has continued to tighten, with national unemployment levels reaching the lowest level experienced in decades. Consequently, the market for qualified employees has become extremely competitive. If we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel, our ability to compete effectively and grow our business will be severely limited. Also, a significant increase in wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction in our skilled labor force or an increase in our operating costs.\nRisks Related to the Availability of Raw Materials\nOur ability to provide products and services to our customers is dependent upon our ability to obtain raw materials necessary to operate our business.\nBarite is a naturally occurring mineral that constitutes a significant portion of our drilling fluids systems. We currently secure the majority of our barite ore from foreign sources, primarily China and India. The availability and cost of barite ore is dependent on factors beyond our control, including transportation, political priorities, U.S. tariffs, and government imposed export fees in the exporting countries, as well as the impact of weather and natural disasters. The future supply of barite ore from existing sources could be inadequate to meet the market demand, particularly during periods of increasing world-wide demand, which could ultimately restrict industry activity or our ability to meet our customers' needs.\nOur mats business is highly dependent on the availability of high-density polyethylene (\u201cHDPE\u201d), which is the primary raw material used in the manufacture of our composite mats. The cost of HDPE can vary significantly based on the energy costs of the producers of HDPE, demand for this material, and the capacity/operations of the plants used to make HDPE. Should the cost of HDPE increase, we may not be able to increase our customer pricing to cover our costs, which could result in a reduction in future profitability.\nRisks Related to the Cost and Continued Availability of Borrowed Funds, including Risks of Noncompliance with Debt Covenants\nWe use borrowed funds as an integral part of our long-term capital structure and our future success is dependent upon continued access to borrowed funds to support our operations. The availability of borrowed funds on reasonable terms is dependent on the condition of credit markets and financial institutions from which these funds are obtained. Adverse events in the financial markets may significantly reduce the availability of funds, which may have an adverse effect on our cost of borrowings and our ability to fund our business strategy. Our ability to meet our debt service requirements and the continued availability of funds under our existing or future loan agreements is dependent upon our ability to generate operating income and remain in compliance with the covenants in our debt agreements. This, in turn, is subject to the volatile nature of the oil and natural gas industry, and to competitive, economic, financial, and other factors that are beyond our control.\nWe fund our ongoing operational needs through a $150.0 million asset-based revolving credit facility (as amended, the \u201cABL Facility\u201d). Borrowing availability under the ABL Facility is calculated based on eligible accounts receivable, inventory, and, subject to satisfaction of certain financial covenants as described below, composite mats included in the rental fleet, net of reserves and limits on such assets included in the borrowing base calculation. To the extent pledged by us, the borrowing base calculation also includes the amount of eligible pledged cash. The lender may establish reserves, in part based on appraisals of the asset base, and other limits at its discretion which could reduce the amounts otherwise available under the ABL Facility. Availability associated with eligible rental mats is also subject to maintaining a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and a minimum level of operating income for the Mats and Integrated Services segment.\nWe are subject to compliance with a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant if our borrowing availability falls below $22.5 million. If we are unable to make required payments under the ABL Facility or other indebtedness of more than $25.0 million, or if we fail to comply with the various covenants and other requirements of the ABL Facility, we would be in default thereunder, which would permit the holders of the indebtedness to accelerate the maturity thereof, unless we are able to obtain, on a timely basis, a necessary waiver or amendment. Any waiver or amendment may require us to revise the terms of our agreement which could increase the cost of our borrowings, require the payment of additional fees, and adversely impact the results of our operations. Upon the occurrence of any event of default that is not waived, the lenders could elect to exercise any of their available remedies, which include the right to not lend any additional amounts or, in the event we have outstanding indebtedness under the ABL Facility, to declare any outstanding indebtedness, together with any accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. If we are unable to repay the outstanding indebtedness, if any, under the ABL Facility when due, the lenders would be permitted to proceed against their collateral. In the event any outstanding indebtedness in excess of $25.0 million is accelerated, this could also cause an event of default under our 2021 Convertible Notes. The acceleration of any of our indebtedness and the election to exercise any such remedies could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nIn addition, credit rating agencies continually review their ratings for the companies that they follow, including us. Credit rating agencies also evaluate the industries in which we operate as a whole and may change their credit rating for us based on their overall view of such industries. There can be no assurance that any rating assigned to our currently outstanding public debt securities will remain in effect for any given period of time or that any such ratings will not be lowered, suspended, or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating agency\u2019s judgment, circumstances so warrant.\nA downgrade of our credit ratings could, among other things:\n\u25aa\nlimit our ability to access capital or otherwise adversely affect the availability of other new financing on favorable terms, if at all;\n\u25aa\nresult in more restricted covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that we may incur;\n\u25aa\ncause us to refinance indebtedness with less favorable terms and conditions, which debt may require collateral and restrict, among other things, our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares;\n\u25aa\nincrease our cost of borrowing; and\n\u25aa\nadversely affect the market price of our outstanding debt securities.\nRisks Related to Operating Hazards Present in the Oil and Natural Gas Industry and Substantial Liability Claims, Including Catastrophic Well Incidents\nWe are exposed to significant health, safety, and environmental risks. Our operations are subject to hazards present in the oil and natural gas industry, such as fires, explosions, blowouts, oil spills, and leaks or spills of hazardous materials (both onshore and offshore). These incidents as well as accidents or problems in normal operations can cause personal injury or death and damage to property or the environment. From time to time, customers seek recovery for damage to their equipment or property that occurred during the course of our service obligations. Damage to our customers\u2019 property and any related spills of hazardous materials could be extensive if a major problem occurs.\nGenerally, we rely on contractual indemnities, releases, limitations on liability with our customers, and insurance to protect us from potential liability related to such events. However, our insurance and contractual indemnification may not be sufficient or effective to protect us under all circumstances or against all risks. In addition, our customers\u2019 changing views on risk allocation together with deteriorating market conditions could force us to accept greater risks to obtain new business, retain renewing business or could result in us losing business if we are not prepared to take such risks. Moreover, we may not be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate. Any damages caused by our services or products that are not covered by insurance or contractual indemnification, or are in excess of policy limits or subject to substantial deductibles, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. See \u201cRisks Related to the Inherent Limitations of Insurance Coverage\u201d below for additional information.\nRisks Related to Business Acquisitions and Capital Investments\nOur ability to successfully execute our business strategy will depend, among other things, on our ability to make capital investments and acquisitions which provide us with financial benefits. Our 2019 capital expenditures are expected to range between $35 million to $45 million (exclusive of any acquisitions). These acquisitions and investments are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u25aa\nincorrect assumptions regarding business activity levels or results from our capital investments, acquired operations, or assets;\n\u25aa\ninsufficient revenues to offset liabilities assumed;\n\u25aa\npotential loss of significant revenue and income streams;\n\u25aa\nincreased or unexpected expenses;\n\u25aa\ninadequate return of capital;\n\u25aa\nregulatory or compliance issues;\n\u25aa\nthe triggering of certain covenants in our debt agreements (including accelerated repayment);\n\u25aa\nunidentified issues not discovered in due diligence;\n\u25aa\nfailure to complete a planned acquisition transaction or to successfully integrate the operations or management of any acquired businesses or assets in a timely manner;\n\u25aa\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from existing operations or other priorities;\n\u25aa\nunanticipated disruptions to our business associated with the implementation of our enterprise-wide operational and financial system; and\n\u25aa\ndelays in completion and cost overruns associated with large capital investments.\nAny of the factors above could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Market Competition\nWe face competition in the Fluids Systems business from larger companies, including Halliburton, Schlumberger, and Baker Hughes, a GE Company, which compete vigorously on fluids performance and/or price. In addition, these companies have broad product and service offerings in addition to their drilling and completion fluids. At times, these larger companies attempt to compete by offering discounts to customers to use multiple products and services, some of which we do not offer. We also have smaller regional competitors competing with us mainly on price and local relationships. Our competition in the Mats and Integrated Services business is fragmented, with many competitors providing various forms of worksite access products and services. More recently, several competitors have begun marketing composite products to compete with our DURA-BASE mat system. While we believe the design and manufacture of our products provide a differentiated value to our customers, many of our competitors seek to compete on pricing. In addition, some of the early patents we received related to our DURA-BASE mat system will expire in 2020 and competitors may begin offering mats that include features described in those patents. We have filed for additional patents, but there is no assurance that these patents will be granted or that competitors will not be able to offer products that are substantially similar to the DURA-BASE mat system.\nRisks Related to Contracts that Can Be Terminated or Downsized by Our Customers Without Penalty\nMany of our fixed-term contracts contain provisions permitting early termination by the customer at their convenience, generally without penalty, and with limited notice requirements. In addition, many of our contracts permit our customers to decrease the products/services with a corresponding decrease in our revenues without penalty. As a result, you should not place undue reliance on the strength of our customer contracts or the terms of those contracts.\nRisks Related to Product Offering Expansion\nAs a key component of our long-term strategy to diversify our revenue streams generated from both operating segments, we seek to continue to expand our product and service offerings and enter new customer markets with our existing products. As with any market expansion effort, new customer and product markets require additional capital investment and include inherent uncertainties regarding customer expectations, industry-specific regulatory requirements, product performance, and customer-specific risk profiles. In addition, we likely will not have the same level of operational experience with respect to the new customer and product markets as will our competitors. As such, new market entry is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters, Including Environmental Regulations\nWe are responsible for complying with numerous federal, state, local, and foreign laws, regulations and policies that govern environmental protection, zoning and other matters applicable to our current and past business activities, including the activities of our former subsidiaries. Failure to remain compliant with these laws, regulations and policies may result in, among other things, fines, penalties, costs of cleanup of contaminated sites and site closure obligations, or other expenditures. We could be exposed to strict, joint and several liability for cleanup costs, natural resource damages and other damages as a result of our conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior operators or other third parties. Further, any changes in the current legal and regulatory environment could impact industry activity and the demands for our products and services, the scope of products and services that we provide, or our cost structure required to provide our products and services, or the costs incurred by our customers.\nMany of the markets for our products and services are dependent on the continued exploration for and production of fossil fuels (predominantly oil and natural gas). In recent years, the topic of climate change has received increased attention worldwide. Many scientists, legislators and others attribute climate change to increased levels of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide attributed to the use of fossil fuels, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The Environmental Protection Agency (the \u201cEPA\u201d) and other domestic and foreign regulatory agencies have adopted regulations that potentially limit greenhouse gas emissions and impose reporting obligations on large greenhouse gas emission sources. In addition, the EPA has adopted rules that could require the reduction of certain air emissions during exploration and production of oil and natural gas. To the extent that laws and regulations enacted as part of climate change legislation increase the costs of drilling for or producing such fossil fuels, limit or restrict oil and natural gas exploration and production, or reduce the demand for fossil fuels, such legislation could have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability.\nHydraulic fracturing is a common practice used by E&P operators to stimulate production of hydrocarbons, particularly from shale oil and natural gas formations in the U.S. The process of hydraulic fracturing, which involves the injection of sand (or other forms of proppants) laden fluids into oil and natural gas bearing zones, has come under increased scrutiny from a variety of regulatory agencies, including the EPA and various state authorities. Several states have adopted regulations requiring operators to identify the chemicals used in fracturing operations, others have adopted moratoriums on the use of fracturing, and the State of New York has banned the practice altogether. In addition, concerns have been raised about whether injection of waste associated with hydraulic fracturing operations, or from the fracturing operations themselves, may cause or increase the impact of earthquakes. Studies are in process regarding the correlation between hydraulic fracturing and earthquakes. Although we do not provide hydraulic fracturing services, we have begun to offer stimulation chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. Regulations which have the effect of limiting the use or significantly increasing the costs of hydraulic fracturing could have a material adverse effect on both the drilling and stimulation activity levels of our customers, and, therefore, the demand for our products and services.\nRisks Related to Legal Compliance\nAs a global business, we are subject to complex laws and regulations in the U.S., the U.K. and other countries in which we operate. These laws and regulations relate to a number of aspects of our business, including anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, sanctions against business dealings with certain countries and third parties, the payment of taxes, employment and labor relations, fair competition, data privacy protections, securities regulation, and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment. The application of these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear and may sometimes conflict. Compliance with these laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in our business practices that could result in reduced revenue and profitability. Non-compliance could also result in significant fines, damages, and other criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions or additional requirements on the conduct of our business and damage our reputation. Certain violations of law could also result in suspension or debarment from government contracts. We also incur additional legal compliance costs associated with global regulations. In some foreign countries, particularly those with developing economies, it may be customary for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, the Italian Criminal Code in Italy, Brazil\u2019s Clean Companies Act, India\u2019s Prevention of Corruption Act and The Companies Act, and Mexico\u2019s Anti-Corruption Law. Although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors, agents, and business partners will not take action in violation with our internal policies. Any such violation of the law or even internal policies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Material Weaknesses in Our Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nPursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to document and test our internal control procedures and to provide a report by management on internal control over financial reporting, including management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of such control. We had a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting identified during 2018 and can give no assurances that material weaknesses will not arise in the future. Although we are working to remedy the material weakness identified in 2018, there can be no assurance as to when the remediation will be completed. Deficiencies, including any material weakness, in our internal control over financial reporting that have not been remediated or that may occur in the future could result in misstatements of our results of operations, restatements of our financial statements, a decline in our stock price, or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to the Inherent Limitations of Insurance Coverage\nWhile we maintain liability insurance, this insurance is subject to coverage limitations. Specific risks and limitations of our insurance coverage include the following:\n\u25aa\nself-insured retention limits on each claim, which are our responsibility;\n\u25aa\nexclusions for certain types of liabilities and limitations on coverage for damages resulting from pollution;\n\u25aa\ncoverage limits of the policies, and the risk that claims will exceed policy limits; and\n\u25aa\nthe financial strength and ability of our insurance carriers to meet their obligations under the policies.\nIn addition, our ability to continue to obtain insurance coverage on commercially reasonable terms is dependent upon a variety of factors impacting the insurance industry in general, which are outside our control. Any of the issues noted above, including insurance cost increases, uninsured or underinsured claims, or the inability of an insurance carrier to meet their financial obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Income Taxes\nOur future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws, both domestically and internationally, or the interpretation or application thereof. From time to time, the U.S. Congress and foreign, state and local governments consider legislation that could increase our effective tax rate. We cannot determine whether, or in what form, legislation will ultimately be\nenacted or what the impact of any such legislation could have on our profitability. If these or other changes to tax laws are enacted, our profitability could be negatively impacted.\nThe U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTax Act\u201d) was enacted in December 2017, resulting in broad and complex changes to U.S. income tax law. Following the enactment of the Tax Act, the U.S. Treasury Department, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d), and other standard-setting bodies have continued to issue new guidance regarding the application or administration of the Tax Act. However, many aspects of the Tax Act remain subject to interpretation, and additional Tax Act guidance is expected to continue to be issued in the future. Any future guidance may differ from our current interpretation, which may result in fluctuations in our effective tax rate in the period in which adjustments are made.\nOur future effective tax rates could also be adversely affected by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, or by changes in tax treaties, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof in one or more countries in which we operate. In addition, we are subject to the potential examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities where we file tax returns. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that such examinations will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Potential Impairments of Goodwill and Long-lived Intangible Assets\nAs of December 31, 2018, our consolidated balance sheet includes $43.8 million of goodwill and $25.2 million of intangible assets, net, substantially all of which relates to the Mats and Integrated Services segment. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently as the circumstances require, if any qualitative factors exist. In completing this annual evaluation during the fourth quarter of 2018, we determined that no reporting unit has a fair value below its net carrying value, and therefore, no impairment is required. However, if the financial performance or future projections for our operating segments deteriorate from current levels, a future impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets may be required, which would negatively impact our financial results in the period of impairment.\nRisks Related to Technological Developments and Intellectual Property in Our Industry\nThe market for our products and services is characterized by continual technological developments that generate substantial improvements in product functions and performance. If we are not successful in continuing to develop product enhancements or new products that are accepted in the marketplace or that comply with industry standards, we could lose market share to competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur success can be affected by our development and implementation of new product designs and improvements and by our ability to protect and maintain critical intellectual property assets related to these developments. Although in many cases our products are not protected by any registered intellectual property rights, in other cases we rely on a combination of patents and trade secret laws to establish and protect this proprietary technology. While patent rights give the owner of a patent the right to exclude third parties from making, using, selling, and offering for sale the inventions claimed in the patents, they do not necessarily grant the owner of a patent the right to practice the invention claimed in a patent. It may also be possible for a third party to design around our patents. We do not have patents in every country in which we conduct business and our patent portfolio will not protect all aspects of our business. When patent rights expire, competitors are generally free to offer the technology and products that were covered by the patents.\nWe also protect our trade secrets by customarily entering into confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, and potential customers and suppliers. Our rights in our confidential information, trade secrets, and confidential know-how will not prevent third parties from independently developing similar information. Publicly available information (such as information in expired patents, published patent applications, and scientific literature) can also be used by third parties to independently develop technology. We cannot provide assurance that this independently developed technology will not be equivalent or superior to our proprietary technology.\nWe may from time to time engage in expensive and time-consuming litigation to determine the enforceability, scope, and validity of our patent rights. In addition, we can seek to enforce our rights in trade secrets, or \u201cknow-how,\u201d and other proprietary information and technology in the conduct of our business. However, it is possible that our competitors may infringe upon, misappropriate, violate or challenge the validity or enforceability of our intellectual property, and we may not able to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights in the future.\nThe tools, techniques, methodologies, programs, and components we use to provide our services may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. Infringement claims generally result in significant legal and other costs, and may distract management from running our business. Royalty payments under licenses from third parties, if available, could increase our costs. Additionally, developing non-infringing technologies could increase our costs. If a license were not available, we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Severe Weather and Seasonality\nWe have significant operations located in market areas around the world that are negatively impacted by severe adverse weather events such as hurricanes in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, typhoons in Australia, droughts across the U.S. and excessive rains outside of the U.S. Additionally, there are market areas around the world in which our operations are subject to seasonality such as Canada where the Spring \u201cbreak-up\u201d (an industry term used to describe the time of year when the frost comes out of the ground causing the earth to become soft and muddy and strict weight restrictions are implemented by the government to prevent potholes forming on roads) results in a significant slowdown in the oil and natural gas industry and our drilling fluids business each year. Such adverse weather events and seasonality can disrupt our operations and result in damage to our properties, as well as negatively impact the activity and financial condition of our customers.\nRisks Related to Cybersecurity Breaches or Business System Disruptions\nWe utilize various management information systems and information technology infrastructure to manage or support a variety of our business operations, and to maintain various records, which may include confidential business or proprietary information as well as information regarding our customers, business partners, employees or other third parties. Failures of or interference with access to these systems, such as communication disruptions, could have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct operations or directly impact consolidated financial reporting. Security breaches pose a risk to confidential data and intellectual property, which could result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of sales and customers, data privacy breaches and damage to our competitiveness and reputation. We have policies and procedures in place, including system monitoring and data back-up processes, to prevent or mitigate the effects of these potential disruptions or breaches. We do not carry insurance against these risks, although we do invest in security technology, perform penetration tests from time to time, and design our business processes to attempt to mitigate the risk of such breaches. However, there can be no assurance that security breaches will not occur.\nAdditionally, the development and maintenance of these measures requires continuous monitoring as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures evolve. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, cybersecurity threats and incidents, none of which have been material to us to date. However, a successful breach or attack could have a material negative impact on our operations or business reputation, harm our reputation and relationships with our customers, business partners, employees or other third parties, and subject us to consequences such as litigation and direct costs associated with incident response. In addition, these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Fluctuations in the Market Value of Our Publicly Traded Securities\nThe market price of our publicly traded securities may fluctuate due to a number of factors, including the general economy, stock market conditions, general trends in the E&P industry, announcements made by us or our competitors, and variations in our operating results. Investors may not be able to predict the timing or extent of these fluctuations.", "PERMNO": 34673, "SIC": 5160, "TIC": "NR"}
