{"cik": "896841", "company": "AVID TECHNOLOGY, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-09", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K, before making an investment decision regarding our common stock. If any of the following risks were to actually occur, our business, financial condition or operating results would likely suffer, possibly materially, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nA natural disaster or catastrophic event may significantly limit our ability to conduct business as normal and harm our business.\nOur operations, and the operations of our customers, are vulnerable to interruptions by natural disasters and catastrophic events. For example, we operate a complex, geographically dispersed business, which includes significant personnel, customers and facilities in California near major earthquake fault lines. We may not be able to protect our company from, and we are predominantly uninsured for, business continuity losses and disruptions caused by such catastrophic events. Disruption or failure of our or our customers\u2019 networks or systems, or injury or damage to either parties\u2019 personnel or physical infrastructure, caused by a natural disaster, public health crisis, terrorism, cyber-attack, act of war, or other catastrophic event may significantly limit our or our customers\u2019 ability to conduct business as normal, including our ability to communicate and transact with customers, suppliers, distributors, and resellers, which may negatively affect our revenues and operating results. Additionally, a natural disaster or catastrophic event could cause us or our customers to suspend all or a portion of operations for a significant period of time, result in a permanent loss of resources, and require the relocation of personnel and material to alternate facilities that may not be available or adequate. Such an event could also cause an indirect economic impact on our customers, which could impact our customers\u2019 purchasing decisions and reduce demand for our products and services. For example, due to the recent outbreak of the coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China, there likely will be disruption to our supply chain as certain of the hardware subcomponent shipments from our manufacturing and hardware development vendors in China may be delayed. Additionally, the outbreak of the coronavirus likely will cause disruption to our customers in China, and possibly elsewhere, reducing or delaying purchasing decisions. We may also experience disruption to our internal operations if we are forced to restrict employee travel, cancel events with customers or partners, or even close office facilities as a result of the outbreak. Although we are monitoring the situation, the Company cannot predict for how long, or the ultimate extent to which the outbreak may disrupt the Company\u2019s operations. Any significant disruption resulting from this or similar events on a large scale or over a prolonged period of time could cause significant delays and disruption to our business until the Company would be able to resume normal business operations or shift to other third-party vendors, negatively affecting our revenue and other financial results. A prolonged disruption of our business could also damage our reputation, particularly among our global news organization customers who are likely to require our solutions and support during such time. Any of these factors could cause a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results.\nThe rapid evolution of the media industry is changing our customers\u2019 needs, businesses and revenue models, and if we cannot anticipate these changes or adapt to them quickly, our revenues will be adversely affected and our business will be harmed.\nThe media industry is rapidly and dramatically transforming as a result of free content, minimal entry costs for creation and distribution, and expanded use of mobile devices. As a result, our customers\u2019 needs, businesses, and revenue models are changing, often in ways that deviate from our traditional core strengths and bases. If we cannot anticipate these changes or adapt to them quickly, our revenues will be adversely affected and our business will be harmed. For example, our customers have to address the increasing digitization of the media industry, which requires the creation of a more seamless value chain between content creation and monetization. Because of the consumerization of the media industry, there is more pressure to create media that can be efficiently repurposed in a variety of ways. As a result of these industry changes, traditional advertising channels are also facing competition from web and mobile platforms, and diminished revenues from traditional advertising could cause some customers\u2019 budgets for the purchase of our solutions to decline; this may be particularly true among local television stations, which in the past have been an important source of revenue for us. Additionally, our customers may seek to pool or share facilities and resources with others in their industry and engage with providers of software as a service.\nThe ongoing evolution of the media industry may reduce demand for some of our existing products and services. New or non-traditional competitors may arise or adapt in response to this evolution of the media industry, which could create downward price pressure on our products and solutions and reduce our market share and revenue opportunities.\nOur success depends in significant part on our ability to offer innovative products and solutions in response to dynamic and rapidly evolving market demand.\nTo succeed in our market, we must offer innovative products and solutions. Innovation requires that we accurately predict future market trends and customer expectations, and that we quickly adapt our development efforts in response. We must also protect our product roadmap and new product initiatives from leaks that might reduce or eliminate any innovative edge that we seek. Predicting market trends is difficult because our market is dynamic and rapidly evolving. Additionally, given the complex, sophisticated nature of our solutions and our typically lengthy product development cycles, we may not be able to rapidly change our product direction or strategic course. If we are unable to accurately predict market trends or adapt to evolving market conditions, we may be unable to capture customer demand and our market reputation and financial performance will be negatively affected. Even to the extent we make accurate predictions and possess the requisite flexibility to adapt, we may be able to pursue only some of the possible innovations due to limited resources. Our success, therefore, further depends on our ability to identify and focus on the most promising innovations.\nOur success also depends on our ability to manage a number of risks associated with new products that we introduce, including timely and successful product launch, market acceptance, and the availability of products in appropriate locations, quantities, and costs to meet demand. There can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful in the near future, or at all, or that our competitors will not take significant market share in similar efforts. If we fail to develop new products and to manage new product introductions and transitions properly, our financial condition and operating results could be harmed.\nOur increased emphasis on a cloud strategy may give rise to risks that could harm our business.\nOur cloud strategy requires continued investment in product development and cloud operations, where we have a limited operating history. Our cloud strategy has also led to changes in the way we price and deliver our products. Many of our competitors may have advantages over us due to their larger presence, larger developer network, deeper experience in the cloud-based computing market, and greater sales and marketing resources. It is uncertain whether our cloud strategy will prove successful, or whether we will be able to develop the necessary infrastructure and business models more quickly than our competitors. Our cloud strategy may give rise to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nif new or current customers desire only perpetual licenses, we may not be successful in selling subscriptions;\n\u2022\nalthough we intend to support our perpetual license business, the increased emphasis on a cloud strategy may raise concerns among our installed customer base;\n\u2022\nwe may be unsuccessful in achieving our target pricing;\n\u2022\nour revenues might decline over the short or long term as a result of this strategy;\n\u2022\nour relationships with existing partners that resell perpetual licenses may be damaged; and\n\u2022\nwe may incur costs at a higher than forecasted rate as we enhance and expand our cloud operations.\nCertain of our enterprise offerings have long and complex sales cycles, which could result in a loss of customers and lower revenues.\nWith our transition to leveraging the Avid MediaCentral platform in our sales process, we have experienced longer and more complex sales cycle for some of our enterprise offerings, which could result in a loss of customers and lower revenues. The length and complexity in these sales cycles is due to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe need for our sales representatives to educate customers about the uses and benefits of our products and services, including technical capabilities, security features, potential cost savings, and return on investment, which are made available in large-scale deployments;\n\u2022\nthe desire of large and medium size organizations to undertake significant evaluation processes to determine their technology requirements prior to making information technology expenditures;\n\u2022\nthe negotiation of large, complex, enterprise-wide contracts, as often required by our and our customers' business and legal representatives;\n\u2022\nthe need for our customers to obtain requisition approvals from various decision makers within their organizations; and\n\u2022\ncustomer budget constraints, economic conditions, and unplanned administrative delays.\nWe spend substantial time and money on our sales efforts without any assurance that potential customers will ultimately purchase our solutions. As we target our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, these trends are expected to continue. Our long and complex sales cycle for these products makes it difficult to predict when a given sales cycle will close.\nThere are a number of financial and accounting risks in our subscription model.\nA growing portion of our revenue is subscription-based pursuant to service and subscription agreements that are generally month-to-month or one year in length, and we intend to continue to expand our subscription-based offerings. Although the subscription model is designed to increase the number of customers who purchase our products and services on a recurring basis and create a more predictable revenue stream, there are certain risks inherent in a subscription-based model. These risks include the risk that customers will not renew their subscriptions, risks related to the timing of revenue recognition, and the risk of potential reductions in cash flows. Although many of our service and subscription agreements contain automatic renewal terms, generally, our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our services after the expiration of their initial subscription period. If customers do renew their subscriptions, these subscriptions may not be renewed on the same terms. Moreover, under certain circumstances, some of our customers have the right to cancel their service agreements prior to the expiration of the terms of their agreements. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our services or if they renew on terms less favorable to us, our revenues may decline. Our future growth is also affected by our ability to sell additional features and services to our current customers, which depends on a number of factors, including customers' satisfaction with our products and services, the prices of our offerings, and general economic conditions. If our efforts to cross-sell and upsell to our customers are unsuccessful, the rate at which our business grows may decline.\nA portion of the subscription-based revenue we report each quarter results from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. A decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any period may not be immediately reflected in our reported financial results for that period but may result in a decline in our revenue in future quarters. If we were to experience significant downturns in subscription sales and renewal rates, our reported financial results might not reflect such downturns until future periods. Our subscription model could also make it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenues from subscription-based services through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers will be recognized over the applicable subscription term. Further, any increases in sales under our subscription sales model could result in decreased revenues over the short term if these sales are offset by a decline in sales from perpetual license customers. If any of our assumptions about revenue from our new businesses or our addition of a subscription-based model prove incorrect, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated, estimated, or projected. We may be unable accurately to predict subscription renewal rates and the impact these rates may have on our future revenue and operating results.\nFailure of our information systems or those of third parties or breaches of data security could cause significant harm to our business.\nOur systems and processes involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data, including personal information of employees, customers, and others. In addition, we rely on information systems controlled by third parties. Information system failures, network disruptions, and system and data security breaches, manipulation, destruction, or leakage, whether intentional or accidental, could impair our ability to provide services to our customers or otherwise harm our ability to conduct our business, impede the development, manufacture or shipment of products, interrupt or delay processing of transactions and reporting financial results, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, or result in the unintentional disclosure of personal, proprietary, sensitive, or confidential information of employees, customers, and others. With our development of Avid MediaCentral Platform, public and private marketplaces and cloud-based offerings, our and our customer\u2019s data and financial and proprietary information could become more susceptible to such failures and data breaches. Significant or repeated reductions in the performance, reliability, security, or availability of our information systems and network infrastructure could significantly harm our brand and reputation and ability to attract and retain existing and potential users, customers, advertisers, and content providers.\nInformation system failures or unauthorized access could be caused by our failure to adequately maintain and enhance our systems and networks, external theft or attack, misconduct by our employees, contractors, vendors, or external bad actors, or many other causes such as power failures, earthquakes, fire, or other natural disasters. Cyber threats are constantly evolving, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. We may have no current capability to detect certain vulnerabilities, which may allow them to persist in the environment over long periods of time. Cyber threats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and customers.\nAny information system failures or unauthorized access to our network or systems could expose us, our customers, or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, resulting in litigation and potential liability for us. In addition, we could incur substantial remediation costs, including costs associated with repairing our information systems, implementing further data protection measures, engaging third-party experts and consultants, and increased insurance premiums.\nWe operate in highly fragmented and competitive markets, and our competitors may be able to draw upon a greater depth and breadth of resources than those available to us.\nWe operate in highly fragmented and competitive markets characterized by pressure to innovate, expand feature sets and functionality, accelerate new product releases, and reduce prices. Markets for certain of our products have limited barriers to entry. Also, the fragmentation in our markets creates an additional risk of consolidation among our competitors, which would result in fewer, more effective competitors. Customers consider many factors when evaluating our products relative to those of our competitors, including innovation, ease of use, price, feature sets, functionality, reliability, performance, reputation, and training and support, and we may not compare favorably against our competitors in all respects. Some of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, and substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution, and support resources than we do. As a result, our competitors may be able to deliver greater innovation, respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in market demand, devote more resources to the development, marketing and sale of their products, successfully expand into emerging and other international markets, or price their products more aggressively than we can. If our competitors are more successful than we are in developing products, or in attracting and retaining customers, our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe obtain certain hardware product components and finished goods under sole-source supply arrangements, and disruptions to these arrangements could jeopardize the manufacturing or distribution of certain of our hardware products.\nAlthough we generally prefer to establish multi-source supply arrangements for our hardware product components and finished goods, multi-source arrangements are not always possible or cost-effective. We consequently depend on sole-source suppliers for many hardware product components and finished goods, including some critical items. We do not generally carry significant inventories of, and may not in all cases have guaranteed supply arrangements for, these sole-sourced items. Our sole-source suppliers may cease, suspend, or otherwise limit production or shipment of our product components, due to, among other things, macroeconomic events, political crises, or natural or environmental disasters or other occurrences, or they may terminate our agreements or adversely modify supply terms or pricing. If any of these events occur, our ability to manufacture, distribute, and service our products would be impaired, and our business could be significantly harmed. We may not be able to obtain sole-sourced components or finished goods, or acceptable substitutes, from alternative suppliers or on commercially reasonable terms. If we are forced to change sole-source suppliers due to a contract termination or other production cessation, it may take a significant amount of time and expenses to obtain substitute suppliers, during which time our inventory may be significantly reduced, which may adversely impact our working capital, liquidity, results of operations, or financial position. We may also be required to expend significant development resources to redesign our products to work around the exclusion of any sole-sourced component or accommodate the inclusion of any substitute component. Although we have procedures in place to mitigate the risks associated with our sole-sourced suppliers, we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain sole-sourced components or finished goods from alternative suppliers or that we will be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms without a material impact on our results of operations or financial position.\nWe have largely completed a transition of the manufacturer of certain of our hardware product components to a new vendor located in Mexico. As it works to meet our expectations, this new vendor may experience difficulty ramping up production to meet our demand within our desired timeline. Such a delay could result in significant product shortfalls and delays in delivery of products to our customers. For example, we experienced greater than expected challenges implementing our new supply chain model in the third quarter of 2019, including with respect to ramping up new production lines, which resulted in approximately\n$8.1 million of hardware orders that were unfulfilled at the end of the third quarter. We plan to mitigate these risks by conducting manufacturing readiness reviews and may place company personnel on site at the international vendors\u2019 facility to assist with production.\nWe depend on the availability and proper functioning of certain third-party technology that we incorporate into or bundle with our products. Third-party technology may include defects or errors that could adversely affect the performance of our products. If third-party technology becomes unavailable at acceptable prices, we may need to expend considerable resources integrating alternative third-party technology or developing our own substitute technology.\nThe profit margin for some of our products depends in part on the royalty, license, and purchase fees we pay in connection with third-party technology which we license for incorporation into our bundling with our products. To the extent we add additional third-party technology to our products and we are unable to offset associated costs, our profit margins may decline, and our operating results may suffer. In addition to cost implications, third-party technology may include defects or errors that could adversely affect the performance of our products, which may harm our market reputation or adversely affect our product sales. Third-party technology may also include certain open source software code that if used in combination with our own software may jeopardize our intellectual property rights or limit our ability to sell through certain sales channels. If any third-party technology license expires, is terminated, or ceases to be available on commercially reasonable terms, we may be required to expend considerable resources integrating alternative third-party technology or developing our own substitute technology. In the interim, sales of our products may be delayed or suspended, or we may be forced to distribute our products with reduced feature sets or functionality.\nOur products may experience defects that could negatively impact our customer relationships, market reputation, and operating results.\nOur software products occasionally include coding defects (commonly referred to as \u201cbugs\u201d), which in some cases may interfere with or impair a customer\u2019s ability to operate or use the software. Similarly, our hardware products could include design or manufacturing defects that could cause them to malfunction. The quality control measures we use are not designed or intended to detect and remedy all defects. Any product defects could result in loss of customers or revenues, delays in revenue recognition, increased product returns, damage to our market reputation, and significant warranty or other expense and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results.\nOur international operations expose us to legal, regulatory and other risks that we may not face in the United States.\nWe derive more than half of our revenues from customers outside of the United States, and we rely on foreign contractors for the supply and manufacture of many of our products. For example, sales to customers outside the United States accounted for 63%, 64% and 62% of our total net revenues in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We also conduct significant research and development activities overseas, including through third-party development vendors. For example, a portion of our research and development is outsourced to contractors operating in Kiev, Ukraine, we have customer support activities in the Philippines, and we have operations in Poland and Israel.\nOur international operations are subject to a variety of risks that we may not face in the United States, including:\n\u2022\nthe financial and administrative burdens associated with environmental, tax, labor and employment, and export laws, as well as other business regulations, in foreign jurisdictions, including high compliance costs, inconsistencies among jurisdictions, and a lack of administrative or judicial interpretative guidance;\n\u2022\nreduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u2022\nregional economic downturns;\n\u2022\neconomic, social, and political instability, security concerns, and the risk of war;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nlonger collection cycles for accounts receivable;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing contracts;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing and staffing international implementations and operations, and executing our business strategy internationally;\n\u2022\ndifficulties managing a global labor force;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added or other tax systems and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022\nincreased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls;\n\u2022\ncosts and delays associated with developing products in multiple languages; and\n\u2022\nforeign exchange controls that may prevent or limit our ability to repatriate income earned in foreign markets.\nAdditionally, recent legal developments in Europe have created compliance uncertainty regarding certain transfers of personal data from Europe to the United States. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which became effective in the European Union, or EU, in 2018, applies to any of our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or related to products and services that we offer to EU users. The GDPR created a range of new data privacy related compliance obligations, which could cause us to change our business practices, and will significantly increase financial penalties for noncompliance, including possible fines of up to 4% of global annual turnover for the preceding financial year or \u20ac20 million (whichever is higher) for the most serious infringements.\nWe may not be successful in developing, implementing, or maintaining policies and strategies that will be effective in managing the varying risks in each country where we do business. Our failure to manage these risks successfully, including developing appropriate contingency plans for our outsourced research and development work, could harm our international operations, reduce our international sales, and increase our costs, thus adversely affecting our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws.\nWe operate in several foreign jurisdictions. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from offering, promising, authorizing, or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of such official in his or her official capacity, inducing the official to do any act in violation of his or her lawful duty, or to secure any improper advantage in obtaining or retaining business. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws, with more frequent voluntary self-disclosures by companies, aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the U.S. Department of Justice and the SEC resulting in record fines and penalties, increased enforcement activity by non-U.S. regulators, and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals.\nWe operate in a number of countries that are recognized as having governmental corruption problems to some degree and where local customs and practices may not foster strict compliance with anti-corruption laws, including China. Our continued operation and expansion outside the United States could increase the risk of such violations in the future. Although we have policies that mandate compliance with these anti-corruption laws and require training, we cannot assure you that these policies and procedures will protect us from unauthorized reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. In the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees or agents have or may have violated applicable anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances, which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management. Violations of these laws may result in significant criminal or civil sanctions, which could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe rely to a significant extent on manufacturing and hardware development vendors with operations in foreign jurisdictions. This may reduce our control over the manufacturing activities, create uncertainty with respect to intended cost savings and expose our proprietary assets to greater risk of misappropriation. Changes to these vendor relationships may result in delays or disruptions that could harm our business.\nWe rely to a significant extent on vendors for the development and manufacture of certain of our hardware products, primarily in Mexico. These relationships provide us with more flexible resource capabilities, access to global talent, and cost savings, but also expose us to risks that may not exist or may be less pronounced with respect to our internal operations. We are able to exercise only limited oversight of our contractors, including with respect to their engineering and manufacturing processes, resource allocations, delivery schedules, security procedures, and quality control. Language and cultural, and time zone differences complicate effective management of contractors that are located abroad. Additionally, competition for talent in certain locations may lead to high turnover rates that disrupt development or manufacturing continuity. The manufacturers we use also manufacture products for other companies, including our competitors. Our contractors could choose to prioritize capacity for other users, increase the prices they charge us or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Pricing terms offered by contractors may be highly variable over time reflecting, among other things, order volume, local inflation, and exchange rates. Some of our contractor relationships are based on contract, while others operate on a purchase order basis, where we do not have the benefit of written protections with respect to pricing or other critical terms.\nMany of our contractors require access to our intellectual property and our confidential and proprietary information to perform their services. Protection of these assets in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions may be less robust than in the United States. We must rely on policies and procedures we have instituted with our contractors and certain confidentiality and contractual provisions in our written agreements, to the extent they exist, for protection. These safeguards may be inadequate to prevent breaches. If a breach were to occur, available legal or other remedies may be limited or otherwise insufficient to compensate us for any resulting damages.\nFurthermore, if one of our international vendors were, for any reason, to cease or experience significant disruptions in its operations, among others as a result of political unrest, we might be unable to replace it on a timely basis with a comparably priced provider. We would also have to expend time and resources to train any new development or manufacturing vendor. If any of the vendors were to suffer an interruption in its business, or experience delays, disruptions, or quality control problems in development or manufacturing operations, or if we had to change development or manufacturing vendors, our ability to provide services to our customers would be delayed and our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nLengthy procurement lead times and unpredictable life cycles and customer demand for some of our products may result in significant inventory risks.\nWith respect to many of our products, particularly our audio products, we must procure component parts and build finished inventory far in advance of product shipments. Certain of these products may have unpredictable life cycles and encounter rapid technological obsolescence as a result of dynamic market conditions. We procure product components and build inventory based upon our forecasts of product life cycle and customer demand. If we are unable to accurately forecast product life cycle and customer demand or unable to manage our inventory levels in response to shifts in customer demand, the result may be insufficient, excess, or obsolete product inventory. Insufficient product inventory may impair our ability to fulfill product orders and negatively affect our revenues, while excess or obsolete inventory may require a write-down on products and components to their net realizable value, which would negatively affect our results of operations. In addition, we experienced greater than expected challenges implementing our new supply chain model in the third quarter of 2019, including with respect to ramping up new production lines. If we experience further disruptions in our supply chain in the future, we may experience significant product shortfalls and delays in delivery of products to our customers.\nOur revenues and operating results depend significantly on our third-party reseller and distribution channels. Our failure to effectively manage our distribution channels for our products and services could adversely affect our revenues and gross margins and therefore our profitability.\nWe distribute many of our products indirectly through third-party resellers and distributors. We also distribute products directly to end-user customers. Successfully managing the interaction of our direct and indirect channel efforts to reach various potential customer industries for our products and services is a complex process. For example, in response to our direct sales strategies or for other business reasons, our current resellers and distributors may from time to time choose to resell our competitors\u2019 products in addition to, or in place of, our products. Moreover, since each distribution method has distinct risks and gross margins, our failure to identify and implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenues and gross margins and therefore our profitability.\nIf we are unable to sell our professional products through retail sales channels, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe continue to have a presence in retail because our professional-level products are offered through specialty retailers. Our ability to continue to sell our professional products through certain retail sales channels could be impaired due to changes in our business strategy, including our shift to more subscription offerings. Changes in our strategy could lead to fewer unit sales through retail channels in the future, which could adversely affect retailers\u2019 willingness to carry our professional-level products and our ability to reach certain customers. If we are unable to sell our professional products through retail sales channels, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to hire and retain competent and skilled management and technical, sales, and other personnel.\nWe are dependent on the continued service and performance of our management team and key technical, sales, and other personnel and our success will depend in part on our ability to recruit and retain these employees in a competitive job market. If we fail to recruit and retain, including through competitive compensation, competent and skilled personnel, we may incur increased costs or experience challenges with the execution of our strategic plan. Also, if we fail to maintain an inclusive and discrimination-free workplace, we risk losing employees.\nOur competitors may in some instances be able to offer a work environment with higher compensation or more opportunities to work with cutting-edge technology than we can. If we are unable to retain our key personnel or appropriately match skill sets with our needs, we would be required to expend significant time and financial resources to identify and hire new qualified personnel and to transfer significant internal historical knowledge, which might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives.\nOur intellectual property and trade secrets are valuable assets that may be subject to third-party infringement and misappropriation.\nAs a technology company, our intellectual property and trade secrets are among our most valuable assets. Infringement or misappropriation of these assets can result in lost revenues, and thereby ultimately reduce their value. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions, and anti-piracy technology in certain of our products to protect our intellectual property and trade secrets. Most of these tools require vigilant monitoring of competitor and other third-party activities and of end-user usage of our products to be effective. These tools may not provide adequate protection in all instances, may be subject to circumvention, or may require a vigilance that in some cases exceeds our capabilities or resources. Additionally, our business model is increasingly focused on software products and, as we offer more software products, our revenues may be more vulnerable to loss through piracy. While we may seek to engage with those potentially infringing our intellectual property to negotiate a license for use, we also may seek legal recourse. As noted in more detail above, the legal regimes of certain foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may not protect our intellectual property or trade secrets to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. If our intellectual property or trade secrets are misappropriated in foreign jurisdictions, we may be without adequate remedies to address these issues. Regardless of jurisdiction, assuming legal protection exists, and infringement or misappropriation is detected, any enforcement action that we may pursue could be costly and time-consuming, the outcome will be uncertain, and the alleged offender in some cases may seek to have our intellectual property rights invalidated. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property and trade secrets, our business could be harmed.\nOur results could be materially adversely affected if we are accused of, or found to be, infringing third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights.\nBecause of technological change in our industry, extensive and sometimes uncertain patent coverage, and the rapid issuance of new patents, it is possible that certain of our products or business methods may infringe the patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Companies in the technology industry own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. Our technologies may not be able to withstand any third-party claims or rights against their use. We have received claims and are subject to litigation alleging that we infringe patents owned by third parties, and we may in the future be subject to such claims and litigation. Regardless of the scope or validity of such patents, or the merits of any patent claims by potential or actual\nlitigants, we could incur substantial costs in defending intellectual property claims and litigation, and such claims and litigation could distract management\u2019s attention from normal business operations. In addition, we provide indemnification provisions in agreements with certain customers covering potential claims by third parties of intellectual property infringement. These agreements generally provide that we will indemnify customers for losses incurred in connection with an infringement claim brought by a third party with respect to our products, and we have received claims for such indemnification. The results of any intellectual property litigation to which we are, or may become, a party, or for which we are required to provide indemnification, may require us to:\n\u2022\ncease selling or using products or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;\n\u2022\nmake substantial payments for legal fees, settlement payments or other costs or damages;\n\u2022\nobtain a license, which may not be available on reasonable terms, to sell or use the relevant technology, which such license could require royalties that would significantly increase our cost of goods sold; or\n\u2022\nredesign products or services to avoid infringement, where such redesign could involve significant costs and result in delayed and/or reduced sales of the affected products.\nPotential acquisitions could be difficult to consummate and integrate into our operations, and they could disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, or impair our financial results.\nAs part of our business strategy, from time to time we may seek to grow our business through acquisitions of or investments in new or complementary businesses, technologies, or products that we believe can improve our ability to compete in our existing customer markets or allow us to enter new markets. There are numerous risks associated with acquisitions and investment transactions including, but not limited to, failing to realize anticipated returns on investment, unanticipated costs and liabilities associated with the acquisition, and difficulty assimilating the operations, policies and personnel of the acquired company.\nUnanticipated changes in our tax provisions, the adoption of new tax legislation, or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our tax liabilities are affected by the amounts we charge for inventory, services, licenses, and other items in intercompany transactions. We are also subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges, cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing, or other matters and assess additional taxes. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. However, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and the amounts ultimately paid upon the resolution of an audit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore, could have a material impact on our tax provision, net income, and cash flows. In addition, our tax provision in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws.\nWe may be subject to litigation, which, if adversely determined, could harm our business and operating results.\nThe costs of defending litigation, whether in cash expenses or in management time, could harm our business and materially and adversely affect our operating results and cash flows. An unfavorable outcome in any litigation matter could require that we pay substantial damages, or, in connection with any intellectual property infringement claims, could require that we pay ongoing royalty payments or prohibit us from selling certain of our products. In addition, we may decide to settle any litigation, which could cause us to incur significant settlement costs. A settlement or an unfavorable outcome on any litigation matter could have a material and adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows.\nEconomic conditions and regulatory changes following the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union, or Brexit, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThere remains significant uncertainty regarding effects of Brexit, including, but not limited to, the imposition of trade barriers and increased costs throughout Europe, changes in European manufacturing and employment markets, and currency fluctuations. While the full effects of Brexit will not be known for some time, Brexit could cause disruptions to, and create uncertainty surrounding, our business and results of operations. The most immediate effect of the expected Brexit has been significant volatility in global equity\nand debt markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations. Ongoing global market volatility and a deterioration in economic conditions due to uncertainty surrounding Brexit could significantly disrupt the markets in which we operate and lead our customers to closely monitor their costs and delay capital spending decisions.\nAdditionally, Brexit has resulted in the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in which we conduct business. Because we translate revenue denominated in foreign currency into U.S. dollars for our financial statements, during periods of a strengthening U.S. Dollar, our reported revenue from foreign operations is reduced. As a result of Brexit, there may be further periods of volatility in the currencies in which we conduct business.\nThe effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the U.K. makes to retain access to EU markets. The measures could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and may cause us to lose customers and employees. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which EU laws to replace or replicate.\nAny of these effects of Brexit could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Liquidity and Financial Condition and Performance\nIf we are not able to generate and maintain adequate liquidity our ability to operate our business could be adversely affected.\nGenerating and maintaining adequate liquidity is important to our business operations. We meet our liquidity needs primarily through cash generated by operations, supplemented from time to time with the proceeds of long-term debt and borrowings under the revolving credit facility, or Credit Facility, governed by the financing agreement, dated February 26, 2016, as amended, between us and the lenders party thereto, or the Financing Agreement. We have the ability to borrow up to $22.5 million under the Credit Facility. We have also undertaken significant cost cutting measures and we may take additional measures to further improve our liquidity. Significant fluctuations in our cash balances could harm our ability to meet our immediate liquidity needs, impair our capacity to react to sudden or unexpected contractions or growth in our business, reduce our ability to withstand a sustained period of economic crisis, and impair our ability to compete with competitors with greater financial resources. In addition, fluctuations in our cash balances could cause us to draw on our Credit Facility and therefore reduce available funds under the Credit Facility (see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d in Item 7 of this Form 10-K). If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or our borrowings are not sufficient, our liquidity may significantly decrease, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nRestrictions in the Financing Agreement may limit our activities.\nThe Financing Agreement contains restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit us, including, among other things, limitations on our ability to make investments, incur additional indebtedness, issue equity, sell assets, pay dividends and make other restricted payments, and create liens. We are also required to comply on an ongoing basis with certain financial covenants, including a maximum leverage ratio and an annual limit on the amount of our capital expenditures. Our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants in the future is uncertain and could be affected by the levels of our cash flows from operations and events or circumstances beyond our control. Failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the Financing Agreement, which could permit acceleration of the outstanding indebtedness under the Financing Agreement and require us to repay such indebtedness before its scheduled due date. Certain events of default under the Financing Agreement may also give rise to a default under our outstanding 2.00% convertible senior notes due 2020, or the Notes, or other future indebtedness. If an event of default were to occur, we might not have sufficient funds available to make the payments required. If we are unable to repay amounts owed, our lenders may be entitled to foreclose on and sell substantially all of our assets, which secure our borrowings under the Financing Agreement.\nWe may not be able to achieve the efficiencies, savings, and other benefits anticipated from our cost reduction, margin improvement, and other business optimization initiatives.\nWe regularly review and implement programs to reduce costs, increase efficiencies, and enhance our business. We have undertaken, and expect to continue to undertake, various restructuring activities and cost reduction initiatives in an effort to better\nalign our organizational structure, and costs with our overall strategy. Past restructuring and cost reduction initiatives have included reductions in our workforce, facility consolidation, transferring resources to lower cost regions, and reducing other third-party services costs.\nIn connection with these activities, we may experience a disruption in our ability to perform functions important to our strategy. Unexpected delays, increased costs, challenges with adapting our internal control environment to a new organizational structure, inability to retain and motivate employees, or other challenges arising from these initiatives could adversely affect our ability to realize the anticipated savings or other intended benefits of these activities and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results.\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business, cash flow and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $229.6 million of indebtedness, including the Notes and borrowings under the Financing Agreement. This substantial level of indebtedness may:\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a greater percentage of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund capital expenditures, pursue other acquisitions or investments, and use for general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic conditions, including increases in interest rates with respect to borrowings under the Financing Agreement that bear interest at variable rates or when our indebtedness is being refinanced;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing; and\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in or challenges relating to our business and industry, creating competitive disadvantages compared to other competitors with lower debt levels and borrowing costs.\nThe Notes mature in June 2020 and were a current liability on our balance sheet for the year ended December 31, 2019. We may elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by paying cash or delivering shares of our common stock. To the extent we do not elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock, we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. Further, if a fundamental change occurs, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing to fulfill our obligation to repurchase the Notes. The Financing Agreement contains restrictions on our ability to settle conversions of the Notes with cash.\nOur failure to repurchase Notes or pay any cash upon conversion of the Notes as required by the indenture governing the Notes would constitute a default under the Financing Agreement, and it could constitute a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness. If the repayment of the indebtedness under the Financing Agreement, or any other indebtedness, were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.\nWe cannot make any assurance that our cash flow from operations, combined with any additional borrowings available to us, will be sufficient to enable us to repay the Notes or our other indebtedness, or to fund other liquidity needs. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future, which could cause these risks to intensify. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows to repay the Notes and our other indebtedness when due or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt, or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance the Notes or our other indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nThe capped call transaction may affect the trading price of our common stock.\nIn connection with the offering of the Notes, we entered into the Capped Call. The primary purpose of the Capped Call was to reduce potential dilution to our common stock and/or offset any cash payments we may be required to make in excess of the principal amount, in each case, upon any conversion of Notes. In order to establish a hedge of the Capped Call, the Counterparty may have entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock, and it may modify its hedge positions from time to time by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock and/or\npurchasing or selling our common stock or other securities in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the Notes. The Counterparty is likely to undertake these activities during, and potentially prior to, any observation period related to a conversion of the Notes. These activities could cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock.\nWe recognized a significant amount of revenue in recent years due to the amortization of deferred revenue attributable to transactions occurring in the past. The reduction in deferred revenues resulted in increased revenue and gross margin and our reported net income in prior years. Revenue from the amortization of deferred revenue will not recur to the same extent in future periods; as a result, there are no assurances that we will be able to report net income in future periods. In addition, as less revenue is recognized from deferred revenue amortization and we have adopted a new accounting standard for revenue recognition, we may experience greater volatility in our quarterly and annual operating results.\nWe have had a historical practice of providing free Software Updates. This represents an implied obligation of a form of post-contract customer support, or Implied Maintenance Release PCS, on many of our products. As a result of this Implied Maintenance Release PCS, we were required, under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, to recognize revenue for many of these transactions ratably over a period that typically ranged from three to six years. Due to changes in accounting rules, namely Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2009-13 and ASU No. 2009-14, and the cessation of our practice of providing Implied Maintenance Release PCS for many of our products, revenue from older transactions continued to be recognized and, in some cases, accelerated into revenue through 2017. This resulted in significant increases to revenue and declines in deferred revenue during 2016 and 2017. New sales of many of the same products now qualify for upfront recognition and do not add significantly to deferred revenue balances. As a result, revenue attributable to older transactions has declined significantly through 2017 as corresponding deferred revenue is fully amortized and not being replenished by new transactions. Deferred revenue for the fiscal years 2016 and 2017 declined approximately $123 million and $31 million, respectively, as a result of these circumstances.\nThe amortization of deferred revenue described above resulted in our reporting a smaller net loss of $14 million in 2017 and net income of approximately $48 million in 2016. With the impact of deferred revenue amortization declining significantly in future periods, there are no assurances that we will be able to report net income in future periods. Our financial results and the impact of the deferred revenue are discussed in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Item 7 of this Form 10-K.\nThe adoption of ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606) on January 1, 2018, which requires virtually all product sales to be recognized as revenue upon delivery, further impacts our deferred revenue balances since, upon adoption, using the modified retrospective method, we recorded a cumulative reduction of deferred revenue of approximately $97 million. With the adoption of ASC 606, we now recognize a greater proportion of revenue upon delivery of our products, whereas some of our product sales under legacy GAAP were initially recorded in deferred revenue and recognized over a longer period of time. With the decreased amount of deferred revenue and more immediate impact of current period sales and shipment activity on revenue, our operating results may be more volatile in future quarterly and annual periods.\nOur revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate from period to period.\nOur results of operations have been, and may continue to, be subject to significant quarterly variation. Our revenues and operating results for any particular quarter may also vary due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those enumerated under the section \u201cCautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K and:\n\u2022\nthe timing of large or enterprise-wide sales and our ability to recognize revenues from such sales;\n\u2022\ndemand planning and logistics;\n\u2022\nrenewal rates under subscription contracts;\n\u2022\nreliance on third-party reseller and distribution channels;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in our supply chain;\n\u2022\nchanges in operating expenses;\n\u2022\nprice protections and provisions for inventory obsolescence extended to resellers and distributors;\n\u2022\nseasonal factors, such as higher consumer demand at year-end; and\n\u2022\ncomplex accounting rules for revenue recognition.\nThe occurrence and interaction of these variables may cause our revenues and operating results to fluctuate from period to period. As a result, period-to-period comparisons of our revenues and operating results may not provide an adequate indication of our future performance. We cannot be certain when, or if, our operations will be profitable in future periods.\nOur revenue backlog estimates are based on certain assumptions and are subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and backlog orders may not be timely converted to revenues in any particular fiscal period, if at all, or be indicative of our actual operating results for any future period.\nOur revenue backlog, as we define it, consists of firm orders received and includes both (i) orders where the customer has paid in advance of our performance obligations being fulfilled, which are reflected as deferred revenues on our balance sheet, and (ii) orders for future product deliveries or services that have not yet been invoiced by us. To the extent that our customers cancel their orders with us, or reduce their requirements during a particular period for any reason, we will not realize revenue or profit from the associated revenue backlog. Even where a project proceeds as scheduled, it is possible that the customer may default and fail to pay amounts owed to us. Material delays, payment defaults, or cancellations could reduce the amount of revenue backlog currently reported, and consequently, could inhibit the conversion of that backlog into revenues. Furthermore, orders included in our revenue backlog may not be profitable. We may experience variances in the realization of our revenue backlog because of project delays or cancellations resulting from external market factors and economic factors beyond our control. In addition, even if we realize all of the revenue from the projects in our revenue backlog, if our expenses associated with these projects are higher than expected, our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nFluctuations in foreign exchange rates may result in short-term currency exchange losses and could adversely affect our revenues from foreign markets and our manufacturing costs in the long term.\nOur international sales are largely transacted through foreign subsidiaries and generally in the currency of the end-user customers. Consequently, we are exposed to short-term currency exchange risks that may adversely affect our revenues, operating results, and cash flows. The majority of our international sales are transacted in euros. To hedge against the dollar/euro exchange exposure of the resulting forecasted payables, receivables and cash balances, we may enter into foreign currency contracts. The success of our hedging programs depends on the accuracy of our forecasts of transaction activity in foreign currency. To the extent that these forecasts are over- or understated during periods of currency volatility, we may experience currency gains or losses. Our hedging activities, if enacted, may only offset a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movement in dollar/euro exchange rates, which could adversely affect our financial position or results of operations.\nFurthermore, the significance to our business of sales in Europe subjects us to risks associated with long-term changes in the dollar/euro exchange rate. A sustained strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro would decrease our expected future U.S. dollar revenues from European sales, and could have a significant adverse effect on our overall profit margins. During the past few years, economic instability in Europe, including concern over sovereign debt in Greece, Italy, Ireland and certain other European Union countries and the uncertainty surrounding Brexit, caused significant fluctuations in the value of the euro relative to those of other currencies, including the U.S. dollar. Continuing uncertainty regarding economic conditions, including the solvency of these countries and the stability of the Eurozone, could lead to significant long-term economic weakness and reduced economic growth in Europe, the occurrence of which, or the potential occurrence of which, could lead to a sustained strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, adversely affecting the profitability of our European operations.\nIn addition, we source and manufacture many of our products in China and our costs may increase should the renminbi not remain stable with the U.S. dollar. Although the renminbi is pegged against a basket of currencies determined by the People\u2019s Bank of China, the renminbi may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the U.S. dollar in the long term. In addition, if China were to permit the renminbi to float to a free market rate of exchange, it is widely anticipated that the renminbi would appreciate significantly in value against U.S. dollar. An increase in the value of the renminbi against the U.S. dollar would have the effect of increasing the labor and production costs of our Chinese manufacturers in U.S. dollar terms, which may result in their passing such costs to us in the form of increased pricing, which would adversely affect our profit margins if we could not pass those price increases along to our customers.\nGlobal economic weakness and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenues, gross margins and expenses.\nOur business is impacted by global economic conditions, which have been in recent years, and continue to be, volatile. Specifically, our revenues and gross margins depend significantly on global economic conditions and the demand for our products and services in the markets in which we compete. Economic weakness and uncertainty have resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased revenue, gross margin, earnings or growth rates, and difficulty managing inventory levels. Sustained uncertainty about global economic conditions may adversely affect demand for our products and services and could cause demand to differ materially from our expectations as customers curtail or delay spending on our products and services. Economic weakness and uncertainty also make it more difficult for us to make accurate forecasts of revenues, gross margins and expenses.\nThe inability of our customers to obtain credit in the future may impair their ability to make timely payments to us. Tightening of credit by financial institutions could also lead customers to postpone spending or to cancel, decrease, or delay their existing or future orders with us. Customer insolvencies could negatively impact our revenues and our ability to collect receivables. Financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers or distributors could result in product delays, increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges. In the event we are impacted by global economic weakness, we may record additional charges relating to restructuring costs or the impairment of assets, and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nEfforts by the current Administration to withdraw from, or materially modify international trade agreements, and the imposition of tariffs, and any other future attempts to otherwise limit international trade could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our business activities is conducted in foreign countries, including Mexico and China. Although the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, which replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement, is likely to be in force in 2020, there remains some uncertainty regarding the ultimate effects of the USMCA on international trade involving the three countries. The current Administration has also imposed certain tariffs on international trade and may consider additional tariffs or other limitations on international trade. As a result of these actions, and any other actions that the U.S. may take in the future to withdraw from or materially modify other international trade agreements, or to otherwise limit international trade, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Stock\nThe market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has historically experienced volatility. Our stock may continue to fluctuate substantially in the future in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nperiod-to-period variations in our revenues or operating results;\n\u2022\nour failure to accurately forecast revenues or operating results or to report financial or operating results within the range of our previously issued guidance;\n\u2022\nour ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements;\n\u2022\nwhether our results meet analysts\u2019 expectations;\n\u2022\nmarket reaction to significant corporate initiatives or announcements;\n\u2022\nour ability to innovate;\n\u2022\nour relative competitive position within our markets;\n\u2022\nshifts in markets or demand for our solutions;\n\u2022\nchanges in our relationships with suppliers, resellers, distributors, or customers;\n\u2022\nour commencement of, or involvement in, litigation;\n\u2022\nshort sales, hedging or other derivative transactions involving shares of our common stock;\n\u2022\nshifts in financial markets and fluctuations of exchange rates; and\n\u2022\nthe actions and decisions of our significant stockholders.\nAdditionally, broader financial market and global economic trends may affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.\nFuture sales of our common stock could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline due to sales of a large number of shares in the market, including sales of shares by our largest stockholders, or the perception that such sales could occur. These sales could also make it more difficult or impossible for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate to raise funds through future offerings of common stock. Future sales of our common stock by stockholders could depress the market price of our common stock.\nDelaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover, which could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nWe are a Delaware corporation, and the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our board of directors, or a committee thereof, has the power, without stockholder approval, to designate the terms of one or more series of preferred stock and issue shares of preferred stock. The ability of our board of directors to create and issue a new series of preferred stock and certain provisions of Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, could impede a merger, takeover or other business combination involving us, or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock, which, under certain circumstances, could reduce the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 78955, "SIC": 3861, "TIC": "AVID"}
