{"cik": "849401", "company": "ADM TRONICS UNLIMITED INC/DE", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-07-14", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following information, together with other information in this annual report, before buying shares of our stock. If any of the following risks or uncertainties occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected, the trading price of our stock could decline and you may lose all or a part of the money you paid to buy our stock.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR OPERATIONS\nNEW ENVIRONMENTAL OR OTHER REGULATIONS COULD INCREASE THE COMPANY'S OPERATING COSTS.\nLike other manufacturers, the Company is subject to a broad range of Federal, state and local laws and requirements, including those governing discharges in the air and water, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous substances and wastes, the remediation of contamination associated with the release of hazardous substances, work place safety and equal employment opportunities. We have made expenditures to comply with such laws and requirements. We believe, based on information currently available to management, that we are in compliance with applicable environmental and other legal requirements and that we will not require material capital expenditures to maintain compliance with such requirements in the foreseeable future. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with such laws and regulations, and violators may be subject to penalties, injunctions or both. Third parties may also have the right to enforce compliance with such laws and regulations. As ADM develops new products, those products may become subject to additional review and approval requirements governing the sale and use of its products. Although our manufacturing processes do not currently result in the generation of hazardous wastes, this may not always be the case and material costs or liabilities may be incurred by us in the future as a result of the manufacturing operations. It is also possible that other developments, such as additional or increasingly strict requirements of laws and regulations of these types, or enforcement policies there under, could significantly increase our costs of operations.\nBECAUSE WE USE VARIOUS MATERIALS AND SUBSTANCES IN MANUFACTURING OUR CHEMICAL PRODUCTS, OUR PRODUCTION FACILITIES ARE SUBJECT TO OPERATING HAZARDS THAT COULD CAUSE PERSONAL INJURY AND LOSS OF LIFE, SEVERE DAMAGE TO, OR DESTRUCTION OF, PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION.\nWe are dependent on the continued operation of our production and distribution facility. This facility is subject to hazards associated with the manufacture, handling, storage and transportation of chemical materials and products, including natural disasters, mechanical failure, unscheduled downtime, labor difficulties, transportation interruptions, and environmental hazards, such as spills, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances and remediation complications. These hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to, or destruction of, property and equipment and environmental contamination and other environmental damage and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. In addition, due to the nature of our business operations, we could become subject to scrutiny from environmental action groups.\nWE RELY SIGNIFICANTLY ON RAW MATERIALS IN THE PRODUCTION OF OUR PRODUCTS AND FLUCTUATIONS IN COSTS OF SUCH RAW MATERIALS WOULD INCREASE OUR OPERATING EXPENSES.\nOur manufacturing operations depend upon obtaining adequate supplies of our raw materials on a timely basis. The loss of a key source of supply or a delay in shipments could have an adverse effect on our business. We are exposed to price risks associated with these raw material purchases. The availability and prices of raw materials may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, new laws or regulations, suppliers' allocations to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange rates, cost components of raw materials and worldwide price levels. Our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner or if the costs of raw materials increased significantly.\nWE FACE COMPETITION FROM OTHER COMPANIES, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.\nWe actively compete with companies producing the same or similar products and, in some instances, with companies producing different products designed for the same uses. We encounter competition in price, delivery, service, performance, product innovation and product recognition and quality, depending on the product involved. For some of our products, our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources. As a result, these competitors may be better able to withstand a change in conditions within the industries in which we operate, a change in the prices of raw materials or a change in the economy as a whole. Our competitors can be expected to continue to develop and introduce new and enhanced products, which could cause a decline in market acceptance of our products. Current and future consolidation among our competitors and customers may also cause a loss of market share as well as put downward pressure on pricing. Our competitors could cause a reduction in the prices for some of our products as a result of intensified price competition. Competitive pressures can also result in the loss of major customers. If we cannot compete successfully, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWE FACE COMPETITION FROM OTHER COMPANIES, WHICH COULD FORCE US TO LOWER OUR PRICES THEREBY ADVERSELY AFFECTING OUR OPERATING MARGINS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, CASH FLOWS AND PROFITABILITY.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and this competition could harm our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. Our competitors include major international producers as well as smaller regional competitors. We believe that a significant competitive factor for our products is selling price. We could be subject to adverse results caused by our competitors' pricing decisions. In addition, current and possible future consolidation among our competitors and customers may cause us to lose market share as well as put downward pressure on pricing. Furthermore, there is a trend toward relocation of manufacturing facilities to lower-cost regions. Such relocation may permit some of our competitors to lower their costs and improve their competitive position. Some of our competitors are larger, have greater financial resources and have less debt than we do. As a result, those competitors may be better able to withstand a change in conditions and throughout the economy as a whole. If we do not compete successfully, our business, operating margins, financial condition, cash flows and profitability could be adversely affected.\nFAILURE TO DEVELOP NEW CHEMICAL PRODUCTS AND/OR IMPROVE OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS WILL MAKE US LESS COMPETITIVE.\nOur results of operations depend, in part, on our ability to expand our product offerings. We are committed to remaining a competitive producer and believe that our portfolio of new or re-engineered products is strong. However, we may not be able to continue to develop new products, re-engineer our existing products successfully or bring them to market in a timely manner. While we believe that the products, pricing and services we offer customers are competitive, we may not be able to continue to attract and retain customers to whom we sell our products.\nFAILURE TO MAKE CONTINUED IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR PRODUCTIVITY COULD HURT OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION.\nIn order to obtain and maintain a competitive position, we believe that we must continue to make improvements in our productivity. When we invest in new technologies or processes, we face risks related to cost overruns and unanticipated technical difficulties. Our inability to anticipate, respond to or utilize changing technologies could have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations.\nCHANGES IN OUR CUSTOMERS' PRODUCTS COULD REDUCE THE DEMAND FOR OUR CHEMICAL PRODUCTS, WHICH MAY DECREASE OUR NET SALES AND OPERATING MARGINS.\nOur chemical products are used for a broad range of applications by our customers. Changes, including technological changes, in our customers' products or processes may make our chemical products unnecessary, which would reduce the demand for those products. Other customers may find alternative materials or processes that no longer require our products. If the demand for our chemical products is reduced, our net sales and operating margins may be reduced as well.\nWE HAVE FEW PROPRIETARY RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO OUR CHEMICAL PRODUCTS, THE LACK OF WHICH MAY MAKE IT EASIER FOR OUR COMPETITORS TO COMPETE AGAINST US.\nNone of our chemical products are protected by patents. We do attempt to protect the names of some of our chemical products through trademarks and some of our other limited proprietary property through trade secret, nondisclosure and confidentiality measures; however, such protections may not preclude competitors from developing similar technologies.\nCUSTOMERS OUTSOURCE THE MANUFACTURING OF THEIR PRODUCTS TO US AND IF OUR OPERATIONS ARE INTERRUPTED OR IF OUR ORDERS EXCEED OUR MANUFACTURING CAPABILITIES, THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DELIVER THEIR PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS ON TIME.\nWe operate a single facility and have limited capacity that may be inadequate if customers place orders for unexpectedly large quantities of products, or if our other customers place large orders of products. In addition, if our operations were halted or restricted, even temporarily, or we are unable to fulfill large orders, our customers could experience business interruption, increased costs, damage to their reputations and loss of their customers. Although customers have the right to utilize other manufacturers, such manufacturers of their products need to be licensed with the FDA, and identifying and qualifying a new manufacturer to replace us as the manufacturer of their products could take several months during which time, they would likely lose customers and our revenues could be materially delayed and/or reduced. In addition, our failure to produce such products could result in claims against us. See \"Item 1. Business - Manufacturer and Suppliers.\"\nWE DEPEND ON A LIMITED NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS FOR THE COMPONENTS AND RAW MATERIALS USED IN OUR PRODUCTS AND THE PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED FOR THIRD PARTIES, AND ANY INTERRUPTION IN THE AVAILABILITY OF THESE COMPONENTS AND RAW MATERIALS COULD REDUCE OUR REVENUE.\nWe rely on a limited number of suppliers for the components and raw materials used in the products that we manufacture for others. Although there are many suppliers for each of the component parts and raw materials, we are dependent on a single or limited number of suppliers for many of the significant components and raw materials due to our customers\u2019 specifications. This reliance involves a number of significant risks, including:\n\u25cf\nunavailability of materials and interruptions in delivery of components and raw materials from suppliers;\n\u25cf\nmanufacturing delays caused by such unavailability or interruptions in delivery; and\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in the quality and the price of components and raw materials.\nWe do not have any long-term or exclusive purchase commitments with any of our suppliers. Failure to maintain existing relationships with suppliers or to establish new relationships in the future could also negatively affect our ability to obtain components and raw materials used in these products in a timely manner. If we are unable to obtain ample supply of product from existing suppliers or alternative sources of supply, we may be unable to satisfy our customers' orders which could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our relationships with these customers. See \"Item 1. Business - Manufacturers and Suppliers.\"\nOUR ABILITY TO EXECUTE OUR BUSINESS PLAN DEPENDS ON THE SCOPE OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND NOT INFRINGING THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS. THE VALIDITY, ENFORCEABILITY AND COMMERCIAL VALUE OF THESE RIGHTS ARE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN.\nOur ability to compete effectively with other companies is materially dependent upon the proprietary nature of our technologies. We rely primarily on patents and trade secrets to protect our products.\nThird parties may seek to challenge, invalidate, circumvent or render unenforceable any patents or proprietary rights owned by us based on, among other things:\n\u25cf\nsubsequently discovered prior act;\n\u25cf\nlack of entitlement to the priority of an earlier, related application; or\n\u25cf\nfailure to comply with the written description, best mode, enablement or other applicable requirements.\nIn general, the patent position of medical device companies are highly uncertain, still evolving and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. We are at risk that:\n\u25cf\nother patents may be granted with respect to the patent applications filed by us; and\n\u25cf\nany patents issued to us may not provide commercial benefit to us or will be infringed, invalidated or circumvented by others.\nThe United States Patent and Trademark Office currently has a significant backlog of patent applications, and the approval or rejection of patents may take several years. Prior to actual issuance, the contents of United States patent applications are generally published 18 months after filing. Once issued, such a patent would constitute prior art from its filing date, which might predate the date of a patent application on which we rely. Conceivably, the issuance of such a prior art patent, or the discovery of \"prior art\" of which we are currently unaware, could invalidate a patent of ours or prevent commercialization of a product claimed thereby.\nAlthough we generally conduct a cursory review of issued patents prior to engaging in research or development activities, we may be required to obtain a license from others to commercialize any of our new products under development. If patents that cover our existing or new products are issued to other companies, there can be no assurance that any necessary license could be obtained on favorable terms or at all.\nThere can be no assurance that we will not be required to resort to litigation to protect our patented technologies and other proprietary rights or that we will not be the subject of additional patent litigation to defend our existing and proposed products and processes against claims of patent infringement or any other intellectual property claims. Such litigation could result in substantial costs, diversion of management's attention, and diversion of our resources.\nWe also have applied for patent protection in several foreign countries. Because of the differences in patent laws and laws concerning proprietary rights between the United States and foreign countries, the extent of protection provided by patents and proprietary rights granted to us by the United States may differ from the protection provided by patents and proprietary rights granted to us by foreign countries.\nWe attempt to protect our trade secrets, including the processes, concepts, ideas and documentation associated with our technologies, through the use of confidentiality agreements and non-competition agreements with our current employees, and with other parties to whom we have divulged such trade secrets. If our employees or other parties breach our confidentiality agreements and non-competition agreements or if these agreements are not sufficient to protect our technology or are found to be unenforceable, our competitors could acquire and use information that we consider to be our trade secrets and we may not be able to compete effectively. Most of our competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, technical and manufacturing resources than we have and we may not be profitable if our competitors are also able to take advantage of our trade secrets.\nWe may decide for business reasons to retain certain knowledge that we consider proprietary as confidential and elect to protect such information as a trade secret, as business confidential information or as know-how. In that event, we must rely upon trade secrets, know-how, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements and continuing technological innovation to maintain our competitive position. There can be no assurance that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or otherwise gain access to or disclose such information.\nIF THE FDA OR OTHER STATE OR FOREIGN AGENCIES IMPOSE REGULATIONS THAT AFFECT OUR MEDICAL DEVICE PRODUCTS, OUR DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING COSTS WILL BE INCREASED.\nThe testing and production of medical devices are subject to regulation by the FDA as devices under the 1976 Medical Device Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. In the United States, medical devices must be:\n\u25cf\nmanufactured in registered and quality approved establishments by the FDA; and\n\u25cf\nproduced in accordance with the FDA Quality System Regulation (\"QSR\") for medical devices.\nAs a result we, as the manufacturer of other parties' devices, are required to comply with QSR requirements and if we fail to comply with these requirements, these other third parties will need to find another company to manufacture its devices. In addition, the Company's manufacturing facility:\n\u25cf\nis required to be registered as a medical device manufacturing facility with the FDA; and\n\u25cf\nis subject to inspection by the FDA.\nThe FDA can impose civil and criminal enforcement actions and other penalties on us if we fail to comply with stringent FDA regulations.\nMedical device manufacturing facilities must maintain records, which are available for FDA inspectors documenting that the appropriate manufacturing procedures were followed. The FDA has authority to conduct inspections of our facility. Labeling and promotional activities are also subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in certain instances, by the Federal Trade Commission. Any failure by us to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse inspection or to comply with applicable FDA regulations could result in enforcement action against us, including a public warning letter, a shutdown of manufacturing operations, a recall of our products, civil or criminal penalties or other sanctions. From time to time, the FDA may modify such requirements, imposing additional or different requirements which may require us to alter our business methods which could result in increased expenses.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMPANY\nWE HAVE A HISTORY OF SIGNIFICANT AND CONTINUED OPERATING LOSSES AND A SUBSTANTIAL ACCUMULATED EARNINGS DEFICIT AND WE MAY CONTINUE TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES.\nWe have incurred net income of $398,790 and a net loss of $225,214 for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. At March 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $32 million. We may incur additional operating losses, as well as negative cash flows from operations, for the foreseeable future.\nThe loss or significant reduction in business of any of our key customers could materially and adversely affect our revenues and earnings.\nWe are highly dependent upon certain customers to generate our revenues. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015, two customers accounted for 38% of revenue. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014, two customers accounted for 19% of revenue. All customer purchases are made through purchase orders and we do not have any long-term contracts with customers. The complete loss of, or significant reduction in business from, or a material adverse change in the financial condition of, any of such customers will cause a material and adverse change in our revenues and operating results.\nWE MAY BE EXPOSED TO POTENTIAL RISKS RELATING TO OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND OUR ABILITY TO HAVE THE OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS ATTESTED TO BY OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM.\nAs directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSection 404\u201d) the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on the company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting in their annual reports on Form 10-K. A report of our management is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to comply with all of the requirements imposed thereby. In the event we identify significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that we cannot remediate in a timely manner, investors and others may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements.\nWE MAY BE EXPOSED TO PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS FOR WHICH OUR INSURANCE MAY BE INADEQUATE.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability risks, which are inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of chemical products and electronic devices. Although we maintain a general liability insurance policy, which includes aggregate product liability coverage of $3,000,000 for certain of our products, there can be no assurance, that such insurance will be sufficient to cover potential claims or that the present level of coverage will be available in the future at a reasonable cost.\nWhile we are not aware of side-effects resulting from the use of any of our products, there may be unknown long-term effects of their use that may result in product liability claims in the future. Further, we cannot provide any assurance that:\n\u25cf\nour insurance will provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities if a product causes harm or fails to perform as promised;\n\u25cf\nadequate product liability insurance will continue to be available in the future; or\n\u25cf\nour insurance can be maintained on acceptable terms.\nThe obligation to pay any product liability claim in excess of whatever insurance we are able to obtain would increase our expenses and could greatly reduce our assets. See \"Item 1. Business - Insurance.\"\nTHE LOSS OF ANY OF OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICER OR KEY PERSONNEL MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS AND OUR ABILITY TO EXECUTE OUR GROWTH STRATEGY.\nOur ability to execute our business plan depends upon the continued services of Andre' DiMino, our President and Chief Executive Officer, as well as our key technology, marketing, sales and support personnel. In January 2013, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Mr. DiMino containing non-compete, confidentiality and other provisions for the benefit of the Company. However, such agreement has provisions for early termination by the Company and/or Mr. DiMino. We do not have employment or consulting agreements containing non-compete agreements with certain of our key personnel, and we may not be able to retain these individuals. If we lost the services of Mr. DiMino or our key personnel, our business may be adversely affected and our stock price may decline. In addition, our ability to execute our business plan is dependent on our ability to attract and retain additional highly skilled personnel.\nOUR EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND ENTITIES AFFILIATED WITH HIM HAVE SUBSTANTIAL CONTROL OVER US, WHICH COULD DELAY OR PREVENT A CHANGE IN OUR CORPORATE CONTROL FAVORED BY OUR OTHER SHAREHOLDERS.\nOur executive officer and director, Mr. DiMino, together with members of the DiMino family, and entities affiliated with them may be deemed to beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 46% of our outstanding common stock. The interests of our current officer and director shareholder may differ from the interests of our other shareholders. As a result, the current officer and director would have the ability to exercise substantial control over all corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, irrespective of how our other shareholders may vote, including the following actions:\n\u25cf\nthe election of directors;\n\u25cf\nadoption of stock option plans;\n\u25cf\nthe amendment of charter documents; or\n\u25cf\nthe approval of certain mergers and other significant corporate transactions, including a sale of substantially all of our assets.\nPENNY STOCK REGULATIONS MAY IMPOSE CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON MARKETABILITY OF OUR SECURITIES.\nOur common stock is subject to penny stock rules, which may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our common stock or affect their ability to sell our securities. As a result, purchasers and current holders of our securities could find it more difficult to sell their securities. Our stock is traded on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board (the \u201cOTC Bulletin Board\u201d). Trading volume of OTC Bulletin Board stocks have been historically lower and more volatile then stocks traded on an exchange or the Nasdaq Stock Market. In addition we may be subject to rules of the SEC that impose additional requirements on broker-dealers when selling penny stocks to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. In general, an accredited investor is a person with assets in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 individually, or $300,000 together with his or her spouse. The relevant SEC regulations generally define penny stocks to include any equity security not traded on an exchange or the Nasdaq Stock Market with a market price (as defined in the regulations) of less than $5 per share. Under the penny stock regulations, a broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination as to the purchaser and must have the purchaser's prior written consent to the transaction. Prior to any transaction in a penny stock covered by these rules, a broker-dealer must deliver a disclosure schedule about the penny stock market prepared by the SEC. Broker-dealers must also make disclosure concerning commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and any registered representative and provide current quotations for the securities. Finally, broker-dealers are required to send monthly statements disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in an account and information on the limited market in penny stocks.\nOUR STOCK PRICE, LIKE THAT OF MANY SMALL COMPANIES, HAS BEEN AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE VOLATILE.\nWe expect that the market price of our common stock will fluctuate as a result of variations in our quarterly operating results and other factors beyond our control. These fluctuations may be exaggerated if the trading volume of our common stock is low.\nWE HAVE NOT PAID DIVIDENDS IN THE PAST AND DO NOT EXPECT TO PAY DIVIDENDS IN THE FUTURE, AND ANY RETURN ON INVESTMENT MAY BE LIMITED TO THE VALUE OF YOUR STOCK.\nWe have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and any return on investment may be limited to the value of your stock. We plan to retain any future earnings to finance growth.", "PERMNO": 76291, "SIC": 2891, "TIC": "ADMT"}
