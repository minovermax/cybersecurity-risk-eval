The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations is not material and we do not believe the cost of compliance with these laws and regulations will be material. We use, generate and discharge hazardous substances, chemicals and wastes at some of our facilities in connection with our product development and manufacturing activities. Any failure by us to restrict adequately the discharge of such substances, chemicals or wastes could subject us to potentially significant liabilities, clean-up costs, monetary damages, fines or suspensions in our business operations. In addition, some of our facilities are located on properties with a history of use involving hazardous substances, chemicals and wastes and may be contaminated. For example, we are in the process of monitoring recently performed environmental remediation at our 10 Water Street, Enfield, Connecticut location under a state remediation program. During our investigation, the site was found to contain a presence of volatile organic compounds, and we have removed contaminated soil to remediate these conditions. The estimated remaining cost we expect to pay to monitor the property is approximately $0.1 million. If we elect to sell, transfer or change the use of the facility, additional environmental testing would be required. We cannot assure that we will not discover further environmental contamination or that we would not be required to incur significant expenditures for environmental remediation in the future.\nAvailable Information\nInformation regarding us, including corporate governance policies, ethics policies and charters for the committees of the Board of Directors can be found on our internet website at http://www.strsolar.com and copies of these documents are available to stockholders, without charge, upon request to Investor Relations, STR Holdings, Inc., 10 Water Street, Enfield, Connecticut 06082.

Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock involves a very high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risks, as well as the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making an investment in us. If any of these risks, or other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial, actually occur, our business, results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affected. In such an event, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have recently incurred substantial losses and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability in the future.\nWe incurred net losses from continuing operations of $13.4 million and $22.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Although we are pursuing plans to improve our financial results, such plans contemplate significant increases in net sales volume compared to 2015 volume. Failure to achieve such net sales may result in continued substantial net losses and will have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects and financial condition.\nWe have a limited amount of cash, a limited factoring arrangement and may not be able to obtain credit.\nAs of the date of this report, we had no credit facilities other than a limited factoring arrangement in Spain. In recent years, the credit markets have experienced unprecedented levels of volatility and disruption. In many cases, the markets still have limited credit capacity for certain issuers, and lenders have requested more restrictive terms. The market for new debt financing is extremely limited and in some cases not available at all to meet our liquidity needs or to fund growth in our business. As a result, until we return to profitability, it is not likely that we will be able to obtain debt or other financing on reasonable terms, or at all. Furthermore, tight credit in the solar manufacturing industry may delay or prevent our customers from securing funding adequate to operate their businesses and purchase our products and could lead to an increase in our bad debt levels.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our principal source of liquidity was $7.7 million of cash, $2.1 million due from Zhenfa and approximately $8.3 million of income tax receivables. Our principal needs for liquidity have been and for the foreseeable future will continue to be, for capital investments and working capital. Payment terms are currently longer in China than in many other markets, resulting in delayed cash receipts from certain of our customers. Although we believe that our available cash will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, including for capital investments, through at least the next 12 months, if we are unable to collect our receivables or obtain bank acceptance notes (which customers in China frequently provide to settle their payables to the Company), or fail to receive payment of receivables in a timely fashion, our financial condition and results of operations will be negatively affected.\nWe currently rely on a single product line for nearly all of our net sales.\nIn 2015 and 2014, we derived substantially all of our net sales from solar encapsulant products. For our business to succeed, we will have to achieve broader market acceptance of our products. As a result, factors adversely affecting the demand for our solar encapsulants, such as competition, pricing or\ntechnological change, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business's growth is dependent upon securing net sales to new customers, growing net sales to existing key customers and increasing our market share, particularly in China.\nWe estimate that our global market share has declined significantly from approximately 30% in 2010 to approximately 3% in 2015. The future success of our business depends on our ability to secure net sales to new customers, to grow net sales to existing key customers and to increase our global market share. Over the last few years, we believe our European and North American customers have lost market share to Asian module manufacturers, primarily from China, who continue to penetrate the global solar market. In order to be successful, we believe that we will need to significantly increase our net sales, including to Chinese module manufacturers. Our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is dependent on a limited number of customers, which may cause significant fluctuations or result in declines in our net sales.\nThe solar module industry is relatively concentrated, and we expect this concentration to increase as the industry continues to consolidate. As a result, we sell substantially all of our encapsulants to a limited number of solar module manufacturers. We expect that our results of operations will, for the foreseeable future, continue to depend on the sale of encapsulants to a relatively small number of customers. ReneSola Ltd and its subsidiaries (\"ReneSola\") and Global Wedge, Inc., each accounted for at least 10% of our net sales, and in the aggregate accounted for approximately 28% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. ReneSola accounted for approximately 37% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2014, while no other customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales. Our top five customers accounted for approximately 49% and 64% of our net sales in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Furthermore, participants in the solar industry, including our customers, are experiencing pressure to reduce their costs. Since we are part of the overall supply chain to our customers, any cost pressures experienced by them may affect our business and results of operations. Our customers may not continue to generate significant net sales for us. Conversely, we may be unable to meet the production demands of our customers or maintain these customer relationships. Any one of the following events may cause material fluctuations or declines in our net sales and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations:\n\u2022 reduction in the price that one or more of our significant customers is willing to pay for our encapsulants;\n\u2022 reduction, postponement or cancellation of orders from one or more of our significant customers;\n\u2022 selection by one or more of our customers of products competitive with our encapsulants;\n\u2022 loss of one or more of our significant customers and failure to obtain additional or replacement customers; and\n\u2022 failure of any of our significant customers to make timely payment for our products, if at all.\nWe currently outsource and rely on a third-party for the manufacture of a portion of our encapsulants, and our future success will be dependent on the timeliness and effectiveness of the efforts of this third party.\nWe have engaged a third-party manufacturer, FeiYu, to supply certain of our proprietary products to us in China. If problems develop in our relationship with FeiYu, or if FeiYu fails to perform as expected, it could lead to product defects, manufacturing and shipping delays, significant cost increases,\nchanges in our strategies, and even failure of our initiatives, each of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nTechnological changes in the solar energy industry or our failure to develop and introduce or integrate new technologies could render our encapsulants uncompetitive or obsolete, which would adversely affect our business.\nThe solar energy market is very competitive, rapidly evolving and characterized by continuous improvements in solar modules to increase efficiency and power output and improve aesthetics. This requires us and our customers to invest significant financial resources to develop new products and solar module technology to enhance existing modules to keep pace with evolving industry standards and changing customer requirements and to compete effectively in the future. During 2013, we engaged in significant cost-reduction actions, including substantial reductions to our research and development and engineering personnel. The reduction of these resources may limit our ability to introduce new products or manufacturing improvements and may put us at a competitive disadvantage, which could negatively impact our ability to increase or maintain our market share and generate net sales, and negatively impact our financial condition, prospects and results of operations. Consequently, our competitors may develop encapsulant products and technologies that perform better or are more cost-effective than our products. This could cause our encapsulants to become uncompetitive or obsolete, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Product development activities are inherently uncertain, and we could encounter difficulties and increased costs in commercializing new technologies. As a result, our product development expenditures may not produce corresponding benefits.\nMoreover, we produce a component utilized in the manufacture of solar modules. New or existing solar technologies that do not require encapsulants as we produce them, or at all, may emerge and/or gain market share. Recently, competitors have introduced new encapsulant products to the market based upon POE. We believe that certain of our former customers are now using POE encapsulant for their modules. Although we have been pursuing the development of POE products, such products are not yet in regular commercial production and it is uncertain as to when or if we will manufacture and sell such products on a regular basis. In the event that solar module manufacturers switch to POE encapsulant products from EVA encapsulants and we do not offer a competitive POE product, such switch could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAlso, manufacturing methods may emerge that could be more advanced or efficient than our current manufacturing capability. Such manufacturing methods could result in competitive products that are more effective and/or are less expensive to produce, resulting in decreased demand for our encapsulants or render them obsolete, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face competition in our business from other companies producing encapsulants for solar modules.\nThe market for encapsulants is highly competitive and continually evolving. We compete with a number of encapsulant manufacturers, many of which are large, global companies with substantially more financial, manufacturing and logistical resources and strong customer relationships. If we fail to attract and retain customers for our current and future products, we will be unable to increase our net sales and market share. Our primary encapsulant competitors include Bridgestone Corporation, Hangzhou First PV Material Co., Ltd., Mitsui Chemicals Group, Inc. and SK Chemical Ltd. We also face competition from suppliers of non-EVA encapsulants including 3M Company, Dow Chemical Corporation, Dow Corning Corporation, Dai Nippon Printing Co., Ltd., and DuPont. We also expect to compete with new entrants to the encapsulant market, including those that may offer more advanced technological solutions or complementary products such as backsheet that possess advanced or more efficient manufacturing capabilities or that have greater financial resources than we do. Some solar\nmodule manufacturers have encapsulant production capabilities of their own and this trend may broaden with market consolidation. Further, as the China solar market matures, we expect additional encapsulant providers from China and the greater Asian markets to compete with us. Our competitors may develop and produce or may be currently producing encapsulants that offer advantages over our products. A widespread adoption of any of these technologies could result in a rapid decline in our position in the encapsulant market and adversely affect our net sales and margins.\nExcess capacity currently exists throughout the solar supply chain leading to substantial solar module price declines, which has caused cost to become the predominant factor in the encapsulant procurement process.\nAlthough recently improving, excess capacity currently exists and may exist again in the future throughout the solar supply chain resulting in decreased selling prices of solar modules. Due to many module manufacturers not producing at full capacity as well as being impacted by pricing pressure, our encapsulants' value proposition has been reduced in the current excess capacity environment. Our customers and potential customers have been increasingly focused on the purchase price of encapsulants. In light of recent declines in our global market share, it is a priority to increase our market share through net sales to existing customers and to new customers. In order to remain competitive, we expect to be subject to continuing pricing pressures that will negatively impact our net sales and net earnings. In addition, our competitors may reduce the price of their products, which may force us to further reduce the price of our encapsulant products to retain net sales.\nIf demand for solar energy in general and solar modules in particular does not continue to develop or takes longer to develop than we anticipate, net sales in our business may continue to stagnate or decline, which would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur encapsulants are used in the production of solar modules; therefore our financial condition and results of operations and future growth are tied to a significant extent to the overall demand for solar energy and solar modules. The solar energy market is at a relatively early stage of development and the extent to which solar modules will be widely adopted is uncertain. Many factors may affect the viability and widespread adoption of solar energy technology and demand for solar modules, and in turn, our encapsulants, including:\n\u2022 cost-effectiveness of solar modules compared to conventional and non-solar renewable energy sources and products;\n\u2022 performance and reliability of solar modules compared to conventional and non-solar renewable energy sources and products;\n\u2022 availability and amount of government subsidies and incentives to support the development and deployment of solar energy technology;\n\u2022 rate of adoption of solar energy and other renewable energy generation technologies, such as wind, geothermal and biomass;\n\u2022 seasonal fluctuations related to economic incentives and weather patterns;\n\u2022 impact of fiscal issues experienced by governments, primarily in Europe;\n\u2022 fluctuations in economic and market conditions that affect the viability of conventional and non-solar renewable energy sources, such as increases or decreases in the prices of fossil fuels and corn or other biomass materials;\n\u2022 changes in global economic conditions including increases in interest rates and the availability of financing and investment capital that is required to fund solar projects.\n\u2022 fluctuations in capital expenditures by end users of solar modules, which tend to decrease when the overall economy slows down;\n\u2022 the extent to which the electric power and broader energy industries are deregulated to permit broader adoption of solar electricity generation;\n\u2022 the cost and availability of polysilicon and other key raw materials for the production of solar modules;\n\u2022 construction of transmission facilities in certain areas to transport new solar energy loads;\n\u2022 saturation in certain markets such as Europe; and\n\u2022 rate of adoption of solar energy in growing solar markets such as the United States, China, India, the Middle East and Africa.\nFor example, we experienced a decline in our business during 2012 and 2011 partially due to overcapacity in the solar supply chain that created excess module inventory, primarily of low-cost Chinese modules, due to weaker-than-expected demand driven by the European financial crisis, global economic uncertainty, falling module prices that did not stabilize and further potential solar subsidy cuts. The result of these dynamics was primarily the loss of the market share of our Western customer base to their Chinese competition, which in turn drove reductions in our net sales and our market share. In 2009, we also experienced a decline in our business mainly due to decreased global demand for solar energy as a result of legislative changes, such as the cap in feed-in tariffs in Spain implemented in 2008, the global recession and the worldwide credit crisis.\nIf demand for solar energy and solar modules fails to develop sufficiently along our expectations, demand for our customers' products as well as demand for our encapsulants will decrease, and we may not be able to grow our business or net sales and our financial condition and results of operations will be negatively impacted.\nOur operations and assets in China are subject to significant political and economic uncertainties.\nWe manufacture our products in China within our own leased manufacturing plant, and also engage a third-party located in China to toll for us. If the manufacture of our products in China is disrupted, our overall capacity could be significantly reduced and net sales and/or profitability could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, changes in Chinese laws and regulations, or their interpretation, or the imposition of confiscatory taxation, restrictions on currency conversion, imports and sources of supply, devaluations of currency or the nationalization or other expropriation of private enterprises could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Under its current leadership, the Chinese government has been pursuing economic reform policies that encourage private economic activity and greater economic decentralization. There is no assurance, however, that the Chinese government will continue to pursue these policies, or that it will not significantly alter these policies from time to time without notice.\nWe may have limited legal recourse under the laws of China if disputes arise under our agreements with third parties.\nThe Chinese government has enacted certain laws and regulations dealing with matters such as corporate organization and governance, foreign investment, commerce, taxation and trade. However, their experience in implementing, interpreting and enforcing these laws and regulations is limited, and our ability to enforce commercial claims or to resolve commercial disputes is unpredictable. If our tolling arrangement or other future arrangements, are unsuccessful or other adverse circumstances arise from these arrangements, we face the risk that our third-party manufacturer may dishonor our purchase orders or unwritten arrangements. Similarly, if our product sale arrangements with customers are\nunsuccessful or other adverse circumstances arise from these arrangements we face the risk that our customers may dishonor their obligation to pay us for purchased products. Further, if disputes arise under our agreements with any other parties doing business in China, including Zhenfa, we face the risk that such party may breach any such agreement or otherwise engage in conduct relating to their relationship with us that could otherwise give rise to liability under U.S. law. The resolution of these matters may be subject to the exercise of considerable discretion by agencies of the Chinese government, and forces unrelated to the legal merits of a particular matter or dispute may influence their determination. Any rights we may have to specific performance, or to seek an injunction under Chinese law, in either of these cases, may be limited, and without a means of recourse by virtue of the Chinese legal system, we may be unable to prevent these situations from occurring. The occurrence of any such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur potential inability to adequately protect our intellectual property during the outsource manufacturing of our products in China could negatively impact our performance.\nIn connection with our tolling manufacturing arrangement, we rely on a third-party manufacturer to implement customary manufacturer safeguards onsite, such as the use of confidentiality agreements with employees, to protect our proprietary information and technologies during the manufacturing process. However, these safeguards may not effectively prevent unauthorized use of such information and technical knowhow, or prevent the manufacturer from retaining them. Although the courts in China are increasing and broadening their protection of intellectual property rights, the legal regime governing intellectual property rights in China is relatively immature and it is often difficult to create and enforce intellectual property rights or protect trade secrets there. We face risks that our proprietary information may not be afforded the same protection in China as it is in countries with well-developed intellectual property laws, and local laws may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights in China, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position. In the event that the third-party tolling manufacturer of our proprietary products misappropriates our intellectual property, our business, prospects and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nA significant reduction or elimination of government subsidies and economic incentives or a change in government policies that promote the use of solar energy could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nDemand for our encapsulants depends on the continued adoption of solar energy and the resultant demand for solar modules. Demand for our products depends, in large part, on government incentives aimed to promote greater use of solar energy. In many countries in which solar modules are sold, solar energy would not be commercially viable without government incentives. This is because the cost of generating electricity from solar energy may exceed the cost of generating electricity from conventional energy sources in some regions of the world and because the capital investment associated with deploying solar modules may have a long payback period or be difficult to finance, making conventional sources available on the grid without capital investment a more widely accessible option.\nThe scope of government incentives for solar energy depends, to a large extent, on political and policy developments relating to environmental and energy concerns in a given country that are subject to change, which could lead to a significant reduction in, or a discontinuation of, the support for renewable energy in such country. Federal, state and local governmental bodies in many of our customers' target markets, including Germany, Italy, Spain, the United States, China, France, Japan and South Korea, have provided subsidies and economic incentives in the form of feed-in tariffs,\nrebates, tax credits and other incentives to end users, distributors, system integrators and manufacturers of solar energy products to promote the use of solar energy and to reduce dependency on other forms of energy. In many cases, the costs of these government subsidy programs are passed on to electricity consumers in the applicable regions. These government economic incentives could be reduced or eliminated earlier than anticipated. For example, in Germany, which was a large solar PV installation market, the government enacted legislation that reduced feed-in tariffs beginning June 30, 2010. In early 2011, the German government enacted further legislation that accelerated the annual year-end feed-in tariff reduction to July 1, 2011 for roof-top systems and September 1, 2011 for ground-mount projects. In 2012, the German government enacted additional legislation that reduced feed-in tariffs by between 20% and 30% depending on the size of the solar energy system. Additional negative changes to solar incentives in 2013 continued to affect the solar markets throughout the European Union. Similarly, in September 2008, the Spanish Parliament decreased the feed-in tariff for solar energy by approximately 27% and capped its subsidized PV installations at 500 MW for 2009. This event drove an over-supply of solar module inventory in the supply chain during the first half of 2009 and was one of the main drivers behind our sales volume decline in 2009 compared to 2008. In addition, numerous other countries have recently reduced solar incentives. A change in government incentives similar to these may result in the pull-in of demand from solar module manufacturers due to increased end-user demand being driven by the incentive to purchase a solar system prior to the enactment of the decreased feed-in tariff incentives.\nIt is our belief that most if not all government solar incentive programs are designed to increase the use of solar energy and are subject to periodic adjustment in light of the rate of installations resulting from the incentive and the economics of solar energy resulting from the price of the installed systems combined with the incentives. As has often happened over the past several years, the rate of incentivized installations has outpaced estimates and the price of solar panels and systems has fallen faster than anticipated. When combined, these dynamics result in a situation where the incentive is more generous than is necessary to drive more installations, and the incentive is subsequently reduced in light of these economics. Adjustments in these incentive programs, which may range from a minor adjustment to a complete shutdown, or in some cases even retroactive action, have resulted in the formation of boom-and-bust cycles within the solar industry.\nSome European governments have recently experienced sovereign debt issues and a risk exists that some of these governments will continue to reduce current subsidies provided for PV installations in conjunction with generally tighter fiscal policies.\nPolicies relative to solar in China, while generally very supportive, have shifted focus and scope with some regularity over the past few years and may change with little notice again in the future. China is currently the world's largest consumption market for solar panel installations as well as production. The strength or weakness of China's economy may cause their domestic solar policy to shift in a positive or negative manner.\nIn the United States, recent solar installation growth has been driven by Renewable Portfolio Standards, regulatory mandates to increase production of energy from renewable sources such as wind, solar, biomass and other alternatives to fossil and nuclear electricity generation, and a 30% federal energy Investment Tax Credit (the \"ITC\") for both residential and commercial solar installation through December 31, 2019. The ITC ratchets down to 26% for 2020, 22% for 2021 and 10% for 2022 and later. The ITC, which was extended as part of the tax extenders package in December 2015, had been set to expire as the end of 2016. In addition to being extended, the ITC now includes a \"commence construction\" clause that allows system owners to claim the associated tax credit provided construction began within the period and is finished before 2024.\nElectric utility companies, or generators of electricity from fossil fuels or other energy sources, could also lobby for changes to the relevant legislation in their markets to protect their revenue streams. Reduced growth in or the reduction, elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for solar energy, especially those in our customers' target markets, could cause our net sales to decline and negatively impact our business.\nOur gross margins and profitability may be adversely affected by rising commodity costs.\nWe are dependent upon certain raw materials, particularly resin, for the manufacture of our encapsulants. EVA resin comprises approximately 50% of our cost of sales. We do not believe that EVA resin can be effectively hedged with derivatives in the commodity markets. Although the prices for resin declined in 2015 and 2014, they have been volatile over the past several years. If raw material prices increase, our gross margins and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nDeterioration of our customers' financial profile may cause additional credit risk on our accounts receivable.\nA significant portion of our outstanding accounts receivable is derived from sales to a limited number of customers. The accounts receivable from our top five customers represented 39% and 79% of our accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. The accounts receivable due from our largest customer was 6% of our accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2015. During the past several years, many solar module manufacturers became insolvent and the number of days outstanding on accounts receivable has increased significantly industry-wide. For example, in 2013, we recorded bad debt expense of $0.3 million and $1.4 million for Suntech Power Holdings Company Limited and Conergy AG, respectively. Moreover, many solar manufacturing companies continue to face significant liquidity and capital expenditure requirements, and as a result, our customers may have trouble making payments owed to us. In addition, payment terms are currently longer in China than in many other locations. In order to mitigate this risk, we are attempting to obtain bank acceptance notes from financial institutions with respect to the accounts receivable from certain of our customers. If we are unable to collect our accounts receivable or obtain bank acceptance notes, or fail to receive payment of accounts receivable in a timely fashion, our financial condition and results of operations will be negatively affected.\nIf we are unable to attract, train and retain key personnel, our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur future success depends, to a significant extent, on our ability to attract, train and retain management, operations and technical personnel. This may be particularly difficult in light of our financial performance and our delisting from the New York Stock Exchange. In addition, we have substantially reduced our headcount during the past few years, which limits the resources available to successfully manage and grow our business. The loss of the services of any member of our senior management team or the inability to hire or retain experienced management personnel could adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan and harm our operating results.\nIn periods of cost reduction, there is a risk that employees may voluntarily leave us to pursue other career opportunities. There is substantial competition for qualified technical personnel for our business, and as a result, we may be unable to continue to attract or retain qualified technical personnel necessary for the development of our business or recruit suitable replacement personnel. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees, our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur dependence on a limited number of suppliers for raw materials for our encapsulants and other significant materials used in our process could prevent us from timely delivery of encapsulants to our customers in the required quantities, which could result in order cancellations and decreased net sales.\nWe purchase resin, the main components used in our manufacturing process, from a limited number of third-party suppliers. If we fail to develop or maintain our relationships with these suppliers or with our other suppliers, or if the suppliers' facilities are affected by events beyond our control, we may be unable to manufacture our encapsulants or our encapsulants may be available only for customers in lesser quantities, at a higher cost or after a long delay. If we do not increase our sales volumes, which drive our demand for our suppliers' product, we may not procure at volumes sufficient to maintain favorable supplier relationships, which could lead to higher costs, lower quality and lack of availability of raw materials. We may be unable to pass along any price increases relating to materials costs to our customers, in which case our gross margins could be adversely affected. In addition, we do not maintain long-term supply contracts with our suppliers. Our inventory of raw materials, including back-up supplies of resin, may not be sufficient in the event of a supply disruption. For example, in 2005, we encountered a supply disruption when a hurricane damaged the facilities of one of our suppliers, and another supplier simultaneously experienced a reactor fire. This forced us to use our back-up supplies of resin. The failure of a supplier to provide materials and components, or a supplier's failure to provide materials that meet our quality, quantity and cost requirements in a timely manner, could impair our ability to manufacture our products to specifications, particularly if we are unable to obtain these materials and components from alternative sources on a timely basis or on commercially reasonable terms. If we are forced to change suppliers, our customers may require us to undertake testing to ensure that our encapsulants meet their specifications.\nProblems with product quality or product performance, including defects, could result in a decrease in customers and net sales, unexpected expenses and loss of market share.\nOur encapsulants are complex and must meet stringent quality requirements. Products as complex as our encapsulants may contain undetected defects, especially when first introduced. For example, our encapsulants may contain defects that are not detected until after they are shipped or are installed because we cannot test for all possible scenarios that may arise in our customers' manufacturing processes. These defects could cause us to incur significant costs, including costs to service or replace products, divert the attention of our engineering personnel from product development efforts and significantly affect our customer relationships and business reputation. If we deliver products with defects or if there is a perception that our products contain errors or defects, our credibility and the market acceptance and sales of our encapsulants could materially decline. In addition, we could be subject to product liability claims and could experience increased costs and expenses related to significant product liability claims or other legal judgments against us, or a widespread product recall by us or a solar module manufacturer.\nWe provide a short-term warranty that we have manufactured our products to our specifications. On limited occasions, we incur costs to service our products in connection with specific product performance matters that do not meet our manufacturing specifications. Also, in isolated occasions, we have offered limited short-term performance warranties relating to our encapsulants not causing module power loss. This type of arrangement may increase in 2016. If we were to ever receive a warranty claim for such matter, we would assess the need for a warranty accrual at that time.\nThe manufacturing process for our encapsulants is highly complex. Minor deviations in the manufacturing process can cause substantial decreases in yield and, in some cases, cause production to be suspended. We have from time to time experienced lower-than-anticipated manufacturing yields. This typically occurs during the production of new encapsulants or during the installation and start-up of new process technologies or equipment. For example, during the third quarter of 2010, we experienced production inefficiencies and low yield associated with ramping newly installed production\ncapacity at our Malaysia facility that negatively impacted our financial results. In addition, we experienced lower yields in 2013 in conjunction with new product introductions. As we expand our production capacity or we introduce new products, we may experience lower yields initially as is typical with any new equipment, process or product introduction. If we do not achieve planned yields, our cost of sales could increase, and product availability could decrease resulting in lower net sales than expected.\nChanges to existing regulations and capacity in the utility sector and the solar energy industry may present technical, regulatory and economic barriers to the purchase and use of solar modules, which in turn may significantly reduce demand for our products.\nThe market for power generation products is heavily influenced by government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry, as well as the internal policies of electric utility companies. These regulations and policies often relate to electricity pricing and technical interconnection of end-user-owned power generation. In a number of countries, these regulations and policies are being modified and may continue to be modified. End users' purchases of alternative energy sources, including solar modules, could be deterred by these regulations and policies. For example, utility companies sometimes charge fees to larger, industrial customers for disconnecting from the electricity transmission grid or relying on the electricity transmission grid for back-up purposes. Such fees could increase the costs of using solar modules, which may lead to reduced demand for solar modules and, in turn, our encapsulants.\nWe anticipate that solar modules and their installation will continue to be subject to oversight and regulation in accordance with national and local ordinances relating to building codes, safety, environmental protection, utility interconnection, metering and related matters in various countries. New or revised government regulations or utility policies pertaining to solar modules may result in significant additional expenses to our customers, and their distributors and end users, which could cause a significant reduction in demand for solar modules and, in turn, our encapsulants.\nThe adoption of solar energy in most parts of the world will be dependent on the capacity of applicable electricity transmission grids to instantaneously accept and distribute the increased volume of electricity to end-users. For example, some countries may implement curtailment policies which would limit solar electricity purchases based on transmission congestion or lack of incremental demand in excess of baseload supply, which may be cheaper for utilities to produce and much more difficult to modulate. The lack of available capacity on the transmission grid could substantially impact the adoption of solar energy which could cause a significant reduction in demand for solar modules and, in turn, our encapsulants.\nWe typically rely upon trade secrets and contractual restrictions, rather than patents, to protect our proprietary rights. Failure to protect our intellectual property rights may undermine our competitive position and protecting our rights or defending against third-party allegations of infringement may be costly.\nProtection of proprietary processes, methods, documentation and other technology is critical to our business. Failure to protect, monitor and control the use of our intellectual property rights could cause us to lose our ability to compete and to incur significant expenses. We typically rely on trade secrets, trademarks and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property rights. However, the measures we take to protect our trade secrets and other intellectual property rights may be insufficient. While we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property rights, such confidentiality provisions related to our trade secrets could be breached and may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets. Also, others may independently develop technologies or products that are similar or identical to ours. In such case, our trade secrets would not prevent third parties from competing with us.\nThird parties or employees may infringe or misappropriate our proprietary technologies or other intellectual property rights, which could harm our business and operating results. Policing unauthorized use of intellectual property rights can be difficult and expensive, and adequate remedies may not be available.\nThe sales cycle for our encapsulants can be lengthy and may result in uncertainty and delays in generating net sales.\nThe integration and testing of our encapsulants with prospective customers' solar modules or enhancements to existing customers' solar modules requires a substantial amount of time and resources. A customer may need up to one year and in some cases even longer, to test, evaluate and adopt our encapsulants and qualify a new solar module before ordering our encapsulants. Our customers then need additional time to begin volume production of solar modules that incorporate our encapsulants. As a result, the complete sales cycle for our business can be lengthy. We may experience a significant delay between the time we increase our expenditures for product development, sales and marketing efforts and raw materials inventory and the time we generate net sales, if any, from these expenditures.\nAs a supplier to solar module manufacturers, disruptions in any other component of the supply chain to solar module manufacturers may adversely affect our customers and consequently limit the growth of our business and net sales.\nWe supply a component to solar module manufacturers. If there are disruptions in any other area of the supply chain for solar module manufacturers, it could affect the overall demand for our encapsulants. For example, the increased demand for polysilicon due to the rapid growth of the solar energy and computer industries and the significant lead time required for building additional capacity for polysilicon production led to an industry-wide shortage of polysilicon from 2005 through 2008, which is an essential raw material in the production of the solar modules produced by most of our customers. This and other disruptions to the supply chain may force our customers to reduce production, which in turn would decrease customer demand for our encapsulants and could adversely affect our net sales.\nWe generally operate on a purchase order basis with our customers, and their ability to cancel, reduce, or postpone orders could reduce our net sales and increase our costs.\nNet sales to our customers are typically made through non-exclusive, short-term purchase order arrangements that specify prices and delivery parameters. The timing of placing these orders and the amounts of these orders are at our customers' discretion. Customers may cancel, reduce or postpone purchase orders with us prior to production on relatively short notice. If customers cancel, reduce or postpone existing orders or fail to make anticipated orders, it could result in the delay or loss of anticipated net sales, which could lead to excess raw materials inventory and unabsorbed overhead costs. Because our encapsulants have a limited shelf life from the time they are produced until they are incorporated into a solar module, we may be required to sell any excess inventory at a reduced price, or we may not be able to sell it at all and incur an inventory write-off, which could reduce our net sales and increase our costs.\nOur substantial international operations and shift of business focus to emerging markets subject us to a number of risks.\nWe operate in several countries worldwide with a focus of increasing our net sales in emerging markets, particularly in China. Of our total net sales, approximately 100% were generated from outside the United States in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and we expect that our international operations will continue to grow in Asia given the current solar market and our strategy to increase our market share in the Asia-Pacific region. Our international operations are subject to a number of risks\nthat could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow, including:\n\u2022 a module manufacturer's unwillingness to purchase from foreign-owned companies;\n\u2022 difficulty in enforcing agreements in foreign legal systems and in the collection of trade accounts receivable;\n\u2022 foreign countries may impose additional withholding taxes or otherwise tax our foreign income, impose tariffs or adopt other restrictions on foreign trade and investment, including currency exchange controls;\n\u2022 protectionist laws and business practices that favor local companies;\n\u2022 difficulties in securing, servicing and increasing net sales to foreign customers;\n\u2022 potentially adverse tax consequences;\n\u2022 fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand and may adversely affect our profitability in U.S. dollars;\n\u2022 potential noncompliance with a wide variety of laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (\"FCPA\"), the Office of Foreign Assets Control and similar non-U.S. laws and regulations;\n\u2022 operations in parts of the world where strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local practices and customs;\n\u2022 inability to obtain, maintain or enforce intellectual property rights and otherwise protect against clone or \"knock off\" products;\n\u2022 labor strikes, especially those affecting transportation and shipping;\n\u2022 risk of nationalization of private enterprises;\n\u2022 changes in general economic and political conditions in the countries in which we operate, including changes in the government incentives on which our module manufacturing customers and their customers rely;\n\u2022 multiple, conflicting and unexpected adverse changes in foreign laws or regulatory requirements, including those with respect to local content rules, environmental protection, export duties, import duties and quotas;\n\u2022 disruptions in our business operations or damage to strategic assets that may not be recoverable from applicable insurance policies caused by potential unfavorable weather patterns in certain locations of the world including, but not limited to, nor'easters, blizzards, earthquakes, typhoons and hurricanes;\n\u2022 difficulty with developing staffing and simultaneously managing widespread operations as a result of, among other things, distance, language and cultural differences; and\n\u2022 difficulty of and costs relating to compliance with the different commercial and legal requirements of the international markets in which we operate.\nOur China operations are subject to national, regional and local regulation. The regulatory environment in China is evolving, and officials in the Chinese government exercise broad discretion in deciding how to interpret and apply regulations. It is possible that the Chinese government's current or future interpretation and application of existing or new regulations will negatively impact our China operations, result in regulatory investigations or lead to fines or penalties.\nWe may be subject to claims that we have infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated the patent or other intellectual property rights of a third party. The outcome of any such claims is uncertain and any unfavorable result could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to claims by third parties that we have infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights. These claims may be costly to defend, and we may ultimately be unsuccessful. An adverse determination in any such litigation could subject us to significant liability to third parties (potentially including treble damages), require us to seek licenses from third parties (which may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all), make substantial one-time or ongoing royalty payments, redesign our products or subject us to temporary or permanent injunctions prohibiting the manufacture and sale of our products, the use of our technologies or the conduct of our business. Protracted litigation could also result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of our products until resolution of such litigation. In addition, we may have no insurance coverage in connection with such litigation and may have to bear all costs arising from any such litigation to the extent we are unable to recover them from other parties. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business could be adversely affected by seasonal trends, incentive policy changes and construction cycles.\nWe may be subject to industry-specific seasonal fluctuations in the future, particularly in climates that experience colder weather during the winter months. There are various reasons for periodic fluctuations, mostly related to economic incentives and weather patterns. A change in government incentives may result in the pull-in of demand from solar module manufacturers due to increased end-user demand driven by the incentive to purchase a solar system prior to the enactment of the decreased feed-in tariff. As a result, we may see atypical net sales during one reporting period as compared to another. In addition, our Spanish operation tends to have lower net sales during the third quarter of the year due to the European summer vacation, which occurs in August. Our net sales are also typically lower in December, as module manufacturers often defer purchases of our encapsulants to the next calendar year due to reduced consumption during the holiday period and the desire to reduce year-end inventory. In the United States, solar module customers will sometimes make purchasing decisions toward the end of the year in order to take advantage of tax credits or for budgetary reasons. In addition, construction activity is typically slower in colder months, especially in light of dangerous or difficult conditions brought about by ice and snow and frozen ground. Finally, due to the rapid emergence of Chinese module manufacturers and the resulting global market share they possess, Chinese New Year can impact the production schedules of our Chinese customers, which could impact demand for our encapsulants during the first quarter of the year. Accordingly, our business and results of operations could be affected by similar fluctuations in the future.\nFluctuations in exchange rates could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, even if our underlying business results improve or remain steady.\nOur reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, and we are exposed to foreign exchange rate risk because a significant portion of our net sales and costs are currently denominated in foreign currencies, primarily euros and Chinese renminbi, which we convert to U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. We currently do not engage in any hedging activities with respect to currency fluctuations. Changes in exchange rates on the translation of the earnings in foreign currencies into U.S. dollars are directly reflected in our financial results. To the extent the value of the U.S. dollar increases against these foreign currencies, it will negatively impact our net sales, even if our results of operations have improved or remained steady. While the currency of our net sales and costs is generally matched, to the extent our costs and net sales are not denominated in the same currency for a particular location, we could experience further exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. We cannot predict the impact of\nfuture exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations and may incur net foreign currency losses in the future.\nWe are a holding company with no business operations of our own and depend on our subsidiaries for cash.\nWe are a holding company with no significant business operations of our own. Our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries. Dividends from, and cash generated by, our subsidiaries are our principal sources of cash to repay any future indebtedness, fund operations and pay any stockholder dividends. Accordingly, our ability to repay any indebtedness, fund operations and pay any dividends to our stockholders is dependent on the earnings and the distributions of funds from our subsidiaries.\nCompliance with environmental and health and safety regulations can be expensive, and noncompliance with these regulations may result in adverse publicity, potentially significant liabilities, monetary damages and fines.\nWe are required to comply with federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations regarding protection of the environment and health and safety. If more stringent laws and regulations are adopted in the future, the costs of compliance with these new laws and regulations could be substantial. If we do not comply with such present or future laws and regulations or related permits, we may be required to pay substantial fines, suspend production or cease operations. We use, generate and discharge hazardous substances, chemicals and wastes in our product development and manufacturing activities. In addition, some of our facilities are located on properties with a history of use involving hazardous substances, chemicals and wastes and may be contaminated. We have performed environmental investigations and remediation activities at our 10 Water Street, Enfield, Connecticut and our former 18 Craftsman Road, East Windsor, Connecticut locations. During our investigations, each site was found to contain the presence of various contaminants. Any failure by us to control the use of, to remediate the presence of, or to restrict adequately the discharge of, such substances, chemicals or wastes could subject us to potentially significant liabilities, clean-up costs, monetary damages, fines or suspensions in our business operations. See Item 1,-Business,-Environmental Regulation. We cannot assure that we will not discover further environmental contamination or that we would not be required to incur significant expenditures for environmental remediation in the future.\nWe may undertake acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or other strategic alliances, which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to manage our business, and such undertakings may be unsuccessful.\nAcquisitions, joint ventures and strategic alliances may expose us to new operational, regulatory, market and geographic risks as well as risks associated with additional capital requirements.\nThese risks include, among other things:\n\u2022 our inability to integrate new operations, personnel, products, services and technologies;\n\u2022 unforeseen or hidden liabilities, including exposure to lawsuits associated with newly acquired companies;\n\u2022 the diversion of resources from our existing business;\n\u2022 disagreement with joint venture or strategic alliance partners;\n\u2022 contravention of regulations governing cross-border investment;\n\u2022 failure to comply with laws and regulations, as well as industry or technical standards of the overseas markets into which we expand;\n\u2022 our inability to generate sufficient net sales to offset the costs and expenses of acquisitions, strategic investments, joint ventures or other strategic alliances;\n\u2022 potential loss of, or harm to, employee or customer relationships;\n\u2022 diversion of our management's time; and\n\u2022 disagreements as to whether opportunities belong to us or the joint venture.\nAny of these events could disrupt our ability to manage our business, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Such risks could also result in our failure to derive the intended benefits of the acquisitions, strategic investments, joint ventures or strategic alliances, and we may be unable to recover our investment in such initiatives.\nUnanticipated changes in our tax provisions, the adoption of a new U.S. tax legislation, or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. Our tax liabilities are affected by the amounts we charge for intercompany transactions. We are subject to potential tax examinations in these various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges, cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing or other tax positions and assess additional taxes. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these examinations in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. However, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these potential examinations, and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of examinations could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore, could have a material impact on our tax provision, net earnings, and cash flows. In addition, our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure, loss of our Malaysian tax holiday, changes in the mix of earnings, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process.\nWe have received financial incentives from government bodies in certain foreign jurisdictions that are based on the maintenance of various requirements. If such requirements are not maintained, we may lose the financial incentives, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have received financial incentives from government entities in certain foreign jurisdictions that are based on the maintenance of various requirements. For example, our Spanish subsidiary has received grants for production equipment that require us to maintain a specific level of employment and use of assets. In addition, we also have a tax holiday in Malaysia through 2019. The tax holiday is based on our Malaysian subsidiary meeting certain metrics surrounding profitability, asset base and employment levels.\nIf we do not satisfy these requirements in the future, we may not qualify for future incentives or may be required to refund a portion of previously granted incentives, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe acquisition of control of us by Zhenfa, a Chinese company, may expose us to greater regulatory scrutiny.\nAt various times during recent years, the governments of the United States and China have had disagreements over political and economic issues. Controversies may arise in the future between these two countries. Any political or trade controversies between the United States and China could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our Chinese strategy, the market price of our common stock and our ability to access the capital markets in the United States. Also, as a result of recent controversies involving Chinese controlled companies, it is possible that such companies have come under increased scrutiny in the United States and other countries. If we become subject to enhanced regulatory review and oversight, responding to such review and oversight may be expensive and time consuming and may have a material adverse effect on our operations, even if we otherwise have complied with all legal and regulatory requirements.\nWe may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the Transaction with Zhenfa, which could result in substantial net losses and may adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nThe success of the Transaction with Zhenfa will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from our strategic alliance with Zhenfa contemplated by the transaction, including the benefits anticipated from Zhenfa's assistance to us under the Sales Service Agreement in marketing, selling and manufacturing our products in China, collecting accounts receivable in a timely manner and in otherwise conducting business in China. We cannot assure that we will be able to cooperate effectively under the Sales Service Agreement or otherwise. Overall coordination with the Zhenfa Group may also be a complex and time-consuming process. Such coordination may be further complicated by geographical, language and cultural differences. Even with proper planning and timely coordination, we cannot assure that we can achieve any anticipated benefits of the Transaction on a timely basis, if at all, or that we will otherwise be successful in expanding our business in China. Failure to achieve the expected benefits from the Transaction could result in continuing substantial net losses and adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nOverall coordination with the Zhenfa Group may also be a complex and time-consuming process. Such coordination may be further complicated by geographical, language and cultural differences. Even with proper planning and timely coordination, we cannot assure that we can achieve any anticipated benefits of the Transaction on a timely basis, if at all, or that we will otherwise be successful in expanding our business in China. Failure to achieve the expected benefits from the Transaction could result in continuing substantial net losses and adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nCertain of our directors and officers may be located outside of the United States.\nCertain of our directors and officers are not United States citizens or may reside outside of the United States. It may not be possible for our stockholders to effect service of process upon such directors and officers within the United States, to bring action against such directors or officers or to enforce against such directors or officers court judgments based on the civil liabilities provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. Further, it is unclear if extradition treaties now in effect between the United States and China (and, for that matter, any other country that one of our directors or officers may be a citizen of or reside in) would permit effective enforcement of criminal penalties against our directors outside of the United States under the United States Federal securities laws or otherwise.\nRisks Related to Owning Our Common Stock\nWe currently have fewer than 300 stockholders of record and, therefore, are eligible to terminate the registration of our common stock under the Exchange Act.\nAs a public company with fewer than 300 stockholders of record, we currently register our shares of common stock under the Exchange Act, on a voluntary basis. Section 12(g)(4) of the Exchange Act allows for the registration of any class of securities to be terminated 90 days after a company files a certification with the SEC that the number of holders of record of such class of security is fewer than 300 persons. Upon the effectiveness of the termination of registration under Section 12, we would not be required to comply with certain disclosure requirements under the Exchange Act, including, but not limited to, proxy statement filings and filings by insiders to disclose the acquisition and disposition of our securities. In addition, upon the filing of the certification with the SEC, our obligation to file annual, quarterly and current reports under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act would be immediately suspended. If we cease filing periodic and current reports for any reason, investors would have limited access to information about our business, which may reduce the value of our common stock and also affect your ability to sell our common stock.\nOur common stock was suspended from the New York Stock Exchange (the \"NYSE\") on September 29, 2015 (and subsequently delisted) and we began trading on the OTC Marketplace on September 30, 2015. Delisting from the NYSE could limit the liquidity of our common stock, and hinder our ability to raise additional capital as well as having other negative results.\nOur common stock was suspended from the New York Stock Exchange (the \"NYSE\") on September 29, 2015 (and subsequently delisted) due to our failure to satisfy the NYSE's continued listing criteria. Our common stock currently trades on the OTCQX Marketplace under the symbol \"STRI,\" which is a less prestigious and less active marketplace. Accordingly, liquidity in the trading of our common stock could be limited, which could limit the ability of our stockholders to sell our common stock in the secondary market.\nAdditionally, trading on an over-the-counter quotation system could adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing through public or private sales of equity securities and could also have other negative results, including the loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities.\nOur common stock is classified as a \"penny stock\" and trading of our shares may be restricted by the SEC's penny stock regulations.\nRules 15g-1 through 15g-9 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), impose sales practice and disclosure requirements on certain brokers-dealers who engage in transactions involving a \"penny stock.\" The SEC has adopted regulations which generally define \"penny stock\" to be any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system. Our common stock is covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and \"accredited investors.\" The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. In addition, the penny stock rules require that, prior to a transaction in a penny stock that is not otherwise exempt, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules may discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our common shares.\nWe expect that our stock price may continue to fluctuate significantly, which could cause the value of your investment to decline, and you may not be able to sell your shares at or above your purchase price.\nOver the past few years the market prices of many companies in the solar industry have been extremely volatile. This market volatility, as well as general economic, market or political conditions, could reduce the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance. The\ntrading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors, including:\n\u2022 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial and operating results, including our cash balance;\n\u2022 market conditions in the broader stock market;\n\u2022 potential short selling interest in our common stock;\n\u2022 the amount of public float that trades regularly;\n\u2022 introduction of new products by us or our competitors;\n\u2022 issuance of new or changed securities analysts' reports or recommendations;\n\u2022 investor perceptions of us and the solar energy industry;\n\u2022 sales, or anticipated sales, of large blocks of our stock;\n\u2022 potential action of corporate raiders or other potential acquirers of us if our stock price is undervalued;\n\u2022 additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022 regulatory or political developments;\n\u2022 litigation and governmental investigations; and\n\u2022 changing economic conditions.\nThese and other factors may cause the market price and demand for our common stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock. In addition, in the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock or have become activist stockholders. If any of our stockholders brings a lawsuit against us, or becomes active with demands, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit and responding to various requests. These events clearly could also divert the time and attention of our management from our business, which could significantly harm our profitability and reputation.\nAs a public company, we are subject to additional financial and other reporting and corporate governance requirements that may be difficult for us to satisfy.\nPrior to November 2009, we operated our business as a private company. Since the completion of our Initial Public Offering (\"IPO\") in November 2009, we have been required to file with the SEC annual and quarterly information and other reports that are specified in Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. We are required to ensure that we have the ability to prepare financial statements that are fully compliant with all SEC reporting requirements on a timely basis. We are also subject to other reporting and corporate governance requirements, including the requirements of the NYSE, and certain provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the regulations promulgated thereunder, which impose significant compliance obligations upon us. If we fail to maintain the requirements with respect to our internal accounting and audit functions, our ability to report our operating results on a timely and accurate basis could be negatively affected.\nWe have implemented the standards required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\"Section 404\"), and failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe have documented and tested our internal control procedures to satisfy the requirements of Section 404, which requires an annual management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting, we may be unable to report our financial information on a timely basis and may suffer adverse regulatory consequences or violations of applicable stock exchange listing rules. There could also be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in us and the reliability of our financial statements.\nIf a substantial number of shares are sold in a short period of time, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nIf our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly. The perception in the public market that such stockholders might sell shares of common stock could also depress the market price of our common stock. As of February 29, 2016, we had 18,345,703 shares of our common stock outstanding, some of which are owned by our directors, executive officers and affiliates. Subject to vesting requirements, these shares are eligible for sale in the public market. A decline in the price of shares of our common stock might impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our stock or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us, as six analysts did in 2013, or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nSome provisions of Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may deter third parties from acquiring us and diminish the value of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide for, among other things:\n\u2022 restrictions on the ability of our stockholders to call a special meeting and the business that can be conducted at such meeting;\n\u2022 restrictions on the ability of our stockholders to remove a director or fill a vacancy on the Board of Directors;\n\u2022 our ability to issue preferred stock with terms that the Board of Directors may determine, without stockholder approval;\n\u2022 the absence of cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022 a prohibition of action by written consent of stockholders unless such action is recommended by all directors then in office; and\n\u2022 advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations.\nThese provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change of control of us that is in the best interest of our minority stockholders. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging future takeover attempts.\nZhenfa beneficially owns a controlling interest in our Common Stock and controls our Board of Directors. As a result, it is able to exert significant influence over us, and Zhenfa's interests may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders.\nAs a result of the transaction with Zhenfa U.S., Zhenfa controls 51% of the voting power of our common stock and is able to, subject to certain conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, control or exert substantial influence over us, including the election of our directors and most matters requiring board or stockholder approval, including business strategies, mergers, business combinations, acquisitions or dispositions of significant assets, issuances of common stock, incurrence of debt or other financing and the payment of dividends. The controlling stockholder may have the effect of making it difficult for a third party to seek, or may discourage or delay a third party from seeking, to acquire a majority of our outstanding common stock, which could adversely affect the market price of our stock. Zhenfa maintains separate business operations from us. As a result, Zhenfa's interests may not always be consistent with the interests of our other stockholders. To the extent that conflicts of interest may arise among us, Zhenfa and its affiliates, those conflicts may be resolved in a manner adverse to our other stockholders.", "PERMNO": 93111, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "STRI"}
