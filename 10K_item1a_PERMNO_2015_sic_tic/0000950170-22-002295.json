{"cik": "1706431", "company": "Vir Biotechnology, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nAn investment in shares of our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors as well as the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d, before deciding whether to invest in our common stock. The occurrence of any of the events or developments described below could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects or cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements we have made in this report and those we may make from time to time. In such an event, the market price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment. You should consider all of the risk factors described when evaluating our business.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Capital Needs\nWe have incurred net losses and anticipate that we may continue to incur net losses in the foreseeable future and therefore, may not be able to maintain profitability.\nAlthough we recorded net income for the year ended December 31, 2021, we have otherwise incurred accumulated net losses since inception in April 2016. We had net income of $528.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, and net loss of $298.7 million and $174.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $138.6 million.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenses and may continue to incur net losses in the foreseeable future. Since inception, we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to identifying, researching and conducting preclinical and clinical activities of our product candidates, acquiring and developing our technology platforms and product candidates, organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital and establishing our intellectual property portfolio. We have received an Emergency Use Authorization, or EUA, from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and a positive scientific opinion from the Committee for Human Medicinal Products, or CHMP, in the European Union, or EU, for sotrovimab (previously VIR-7831). To date, sotrovimab has been granted EUA, temporary authorization or marketing approval (under the brand name Xevudy\u00ae) in more than 40 countries. Although we (through our collaborator Glaxo Wellcome UK Limited and GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals S.A. (individually and collectively referred to as GSK)) have recently entered into procurement agreements to supply sotrovimab to governments around the world and began to recognize revenue for sotrovimab, the extent of future revenue remains uncertain. However, there are no assurances that we will secure additional supply commitments from governments. In addition, COVID-19 treatment standards are susceptible to rapid changes in epidemiology and the emergence of new variants, thus, sotrovimab may be rendered inferior or obsolete in the future. It could be several years, if ever, before we are able to commercialize any of our other product candidates. Any net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. To remain profitable, we must succeed in developing and eventually commercializing products that generate significant revenue. This will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including completing preclinical studies and clinical trials of our current and future product candidates, obtaining regulatory approval, procuring commercial-scale manufacturing, marketing and selling any products for which we obtain regulatory approval (including through third parties), as well as discovering or acquiring and developing additional product candidates. We are only in the preliminary stages of most of these activities. We may never succeed in these activities and, even if we do, may not be able to continue to generate revenue that is sufficient to offset our expenses and maintain profitability.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with biopharmaceutical product development, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of expenses, or if, we will be able to maintain profitability. If we are required by regulatory authorities to perform studies and trials in addition to those currently expected, or if there are any delays in the initiation and completion of our clinical trials or the development of any of our product candidates, our expenses could increase. For example, the FDA has asked for additional data to support our conclusion that the 500 mg IV dose of sotrovimab retains activity against the BA.2 Omicron subvariant based on our current modeling assumptions as well as safety data for higher doses. We could be required to perform additional studies and trials on sotrovimab based on any additional feedback we may receive from the FDA.\nWe may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to remain profitable would decrease the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, maintain our research and development efforts, expand our business or continue our operations.\nOur limited operating history may make it difficult for you to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability.\nWe are a commercial-stage company founded in April 2016 and our operations to date have been largely focused on identifying, researching and conducting preclinical and clinical activities of our product candidates, acquiring and developing our technology platforms and product candidates, organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital and establishing our intellectual property portfolio. Sotrovimab has received an EUA from the FDA and marketing authorization in the EU. To date, sotrovimab has been granted EUA, temporary authorization or marketing approval (under the brand name Xevudy\u00ae) in more than 40 countries. We are in the early stages of seeking approval under a biologics license application, or BLA, and expanding our commercialization capabilities for sotrovimab. As an organization, we have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully manufacture a BLA-approved, commercial-scale product or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful commercialization. Consequently, any predictions about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history.\nWe currently have four technology platforms and eight product candidates in our development pipeline. We may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known or unknown factors in achieving our business objectives, including with respect to our technology platforms and product candidates.\nWe may require substantial additional funding to finance our operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we could be forced to delay, reduce or terminate certain of our development programs or other operations.\nAs of December 31, 2021, excluding restricted cash, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $909.5 million and by also excluding the equity investment in Brii Biosciences Limited, or Brii Bio Parent, we had $766.4 million. Based upon our current operating plan, we believe that the $766.4 million as of December 31, 2021 will fund our current operating plans for at least the next 12 months. However, our operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us, and we may need to seek additional financing to fund our long-term operations sooner than planned. Moreover, it is particularly difficult to estimate with certainty our future expenses given the dynamic and rapidly evolving nature of our business and the COVID-19 pandemic environment generally. We may also need to raise additional capital to complete the development and commercialization of our EUA product or our product candidates and fund certain of our existing manufacturing and other commitments. We expect to finance our cash needs through public or private equity or debt financings, third-party (including government) funding and marketing and distribution arrangements, as well as other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements, or any combination of these approaches. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022the timing, progress and results of our ongoing preclinical studies and clinical trials of our EUA product and other product candidates;\n\u2022the scope, progress, results and costs of preclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials of other product candidates that we may pursue;\n\u2022our ability to establish and maintain collaboration, license, grant and other similar arrangements, and the financial terms of any such arrangements, including timing and amount of any future milestones, royalty or other payments due thereunder;\n\u2022the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our EUA product and other product candidates;\n\u2022the costs and timing of commercialization activities, including product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution, for our EUA product and any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;\n\u2022the amount of revenue received from commercial sales of our EUA product or any product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;\n\u2022the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims;\n\u2022any expenses needed to attract, hire and retain skilled personnel;\n\u2022the costs of operating as a public company; and\n\u2022the extent to which we acquire or in-license other companies\u2019 product candidates and technologies.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the evolution of new and existing variants of COVID-19 have resulted in a significant disruption of global financial markets. If the disruption persists and deepens, we could experience an inability to access\nadditional capital, which could in the future negatively affect our capacity for certain corporate development transactions or our ability to make other important, opportunistic investments. In addition, market volatility, inflation and interest rate fluctuations may increase our cost of financing or restrict our access to potential sources of future liquidity. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or altogether terminate our research and development programs or commercialization efforts, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our product candidates.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs through public or private equity or debt financings, third-party (including government) funding and marketing and distribution arrangements, as well as other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements, or any combination of these approaches. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest in our company may be diluted and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a stockholder. Debt and equity financings, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as redeeming our shares, making investments, incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, declaring dividends or placing limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights.\nIf we raise additional capital through future collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our intellectual property, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional capital when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise develop and market ourselves.\nWe received an EUA from the FDA for sotrovimab. If the FDA revokes or terminates our EUA for sotrovimab for the early treatment of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, or the federally-declared COVID-19 public health emergency ends, we will be required to stop commercial distribution of sotrovimab in the United States unless we can obtain FDA approval for this product and its currently authorized uses.\nSotrovimab is currently made available pursuant to an EUA we received from the FDA on May 26, 2021 for the early treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg) with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing, and who are at risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death. The FDA will periodically review the circumstances and appropriateness of an EUA, including circumstances that might warrant revocation of the EUA. The review will include regular assessment based on additional information provided by the sponsor of the progress made with respect to the approval, licensure, or clearance of the unapproved product, or of the unapproved use of an approved product, for which an EUA was issued. The FDA may revise or revoke an EUA if the circumstances justifying its issuance no longer exist, the criteria for its issuance are no longer met, or other circumstances make a revision or revocation appropriate to protect the public health or safety. Such circumstances may include significant adverse inspectional findings; reports of adverse events linked to, or suspected of being caused by, the EUA product; a material change in the risk/benefit assessment based on evolving understanding of the disease or condition and/or availability of authorized medical products; or a change in the approval status of the product may make an EUA unnecessary. An EUA may also be terminated upon a declaration by the Secretary of the Health and Human Services, or HHS, that the public health emergency has ended. We cannot predict how long our EUA will remain in effect, and we may not receive advance notice from the FDA regarding revocation of our EUA or withdrawal of the public health emergency declaration. If our EUA is terminated or revoked, sotrovimab will no longer be available in the United States unless and until we have obtained FDA approval of a BLA for the product. Changing policies and regulatory requirements could limit, delay or prevent further commercialization of sotrovimab and could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe are committing substantial financial resources and personnel and making substantial capital commitments with third parties in connection with sotrovimab as a therapy for COVID-19. Market demand and utilization of sotrovimab or any of our other COVID-19 product candidates may be adversely impacted by factors such as the development of monoclonal antibodies, or mAbs, of other third parties, the rollout of vaccines and oral antivirals, the emergence of new viral variants, and the current challenges in the delivery and administration of mAbs to patients.\nIn response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we are pursuing various potential therapies to address the disease, including through mAbs using our antibody platform (in collaboration with several partners), such as sotrovimab and VIR-7832. Sotrovimab has received an EUA from the FDA and marketing authorization in the EU. To date, sotrovimab has been granted EUA, temporary authorization or marketing approval (under the brand name Xevudy\u00ae) in more than 40 countries. Also, we (through our collaborator GSK) have recently entered into procurement agreements to supply sotrovimab to governments around the world; however, there are no assurances that we will secure additional supply commitments from governments. We have not received regulatory approval for any of our other product candidates.\nWe are committing substantial financial resources, both internally and externally, and personnel to the development of a therapy for COVID-19, which may cause delays in or otherwise negatively impact our other development programs. There are no assurances that there will be sufficient market demand for sotrovimab or our other COVID-19 product candidates. Market demand and utilization of sotrovimab or any of our other COVID-19 product candidates may be adversely impacted by factors such as the development of mAbs of other third parties, the rollout of vaccines and oral antivirals, the emergence of new viral variants, and the current challenges in the delivery and administration of mAbs to patients. In addition, COVID-19 treatment standards are susceptible to rapid changes in epidemiology and the emergence of new variants, thus, sotrovimab may be rendered inferior or obsolete in the future, even if it were to gain widespread market acceptance initially. If sotrovimab is rendered inferior or obsolete in the future, our financial condition and business may be adversely affected.\nOur ability to develop a successful therapy will also depend on the success of our manufacturing capabilities, for which we are dependent on third-party manufacturing organizations and which will require significant additional funding. Our current estimated aggregate commitments to GSK under two separate master services agreements with Samsung Biologics Co., Ltd. and WuXi Biologics (Hong Kong) Limited, or WuXi Biologics, for drug substance, drug product and raw material were approximately $188 million as of December 31, 2021. For additional information regarding our obligations under these agreements, see the section titled \u201cBusiness-Our Collaboration, License and Grant Agreements\u201d and \u201cBusiness-Manufacturing-Manufacturing Agreements.\u201d\nWhile we believe securing such manufacturing capacity and technological expertise is essential to the potential success of our SARS-CoV-2 antibody development programs, such capital commitments plus any future commitments, in the aggregate, may, in the future, exceed our available cash and cash equivalents and investments. We may also need to enter into additional manufacturing arrangements in the future in order to create an effective supply chain for sotrovimab and our other COVID-19 product candidates that will adequately support demand. In the event that there is not enough demand for the manufacturing capacity that we have already secured or regulatory approval of our product candidates is delayed or unsuccessful, we may remain obligated to pay for such excess manufacturing capacity, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We will need to raise substantial additional capital to fund the development of sotrovimab and our other product candidates and meet our capital commitments to our manufacturing partners in connection therewith. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available to us on attractive terms or at all and our ability to obtain additional capital could be adversely affected if there is a significant decline in the demand for our products or other significantly unfavorable changes in economic conditions. If we are unable to obtain additional funding from these or other sources, it may be necessary to significantly reduce our rate of spending through reductions in staff and delaying, scaling back, or stopping certain research and development programs. Insufficient liquidity may also require us to relinquish rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose. Our business could be negatively impacted by our allocation of significant resources to a global health threat that is unpredictable or against which our potential therapies, if developed, may not be partially or fully effective, and may ultimately prove unsuccessful or unprofitable. Furthermore, there are no assurances that we will secure additional supply commitments from governments, which may be material to the commercial success of sotrovimab and our product candidates, either in the United States or abroad.\nThere are also efforts by other companies in developing prophylactic vaccines against COVID-19. For example, in August 2021 Pfizer Inc.\u2019s, or Pfizer, COVID-19 vaccine, Comirnaty\u00ae, which has been proven to be 95% effective in clinical trials, was approved by the FDA for individuals 16 years of age or older and is also available under EUA for individuals 12 through 15 years of age. In January 2022, Moderna, Inc.'s vaccine, Spikevax\u00ae, which has proven to be 94% effective in clinical trials, was approved by the FDA for individuals 18 years of age or older. In addition, in February 2021 Janssen Biotech, Inc. received EUA from the FDA for its COVID-19 vaccine, which has been proven to be 85% effective in clinical trials. These other entities may be more successful at developing, manufacturing or commercializing a therapy for COVID-19. Several of these other organizations are much larger than we are and have access to larger pools of capital, including U.S. government funding, and broader manufacturing infrastructure. There are no assurances that there will be sufficient market demand for our COVID-19 therapies, that we will secure U.S. government funding, that our manufacturing and supply chain infrastructure will remain uninterrupted and reliable, or that the third parties we rely on to manufacture our COVID-19\ntherapies will be able to satisfy demand in a timely manner and not have supply chain disruptions due to COVID-19 related shutdowns, stock-outs due to raw material shortages and/or greater than anticipated demand or quality issues given the operational challenges and raw material shortages that have been experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, all of which may adversely impact our ability to commercialize a therapy for COVID-19. In addition, several organizations have already secured significant commitments from governments to purchase COVID-19 antibodies, oral antivirals, and vaccines. The success or failure of other entities, or perceived success or failure, may adversely impact our ability to obtain any future funding for our development and manufacturing efforts or to successfully commercialize a therapy for COVID-19. Additionally, the availability of superior or competitive therapies, or preventative measures such as vaccines or oral antivirals, coupled with the transient nature of pandemics, could negatively impact or eliminate demand for our COVID-19 therapies. For additional information regarding our competition see the section below titled \u201c-Risks Related to the Development and Commercialization - We face substantial competition, which may result in others developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than us.\u201d\nOur near-term success is dependent on the successful commercialization of sotrovimab for the early treatment of COVID-19, including our ability to enter into additional procurement contracts with government entities. If we are unable to successfully commercialize sotrovimab, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected. In addition, sotrovimab may be rendered inferior or obsolete, even if it were to gain widespread market acceptance initially.\nOur near-term success is dependent on the successful commercialization of sotrovimab, which is our only currently available commercial product. The commercial success of sotrovimab will depend on a number of factors, some of which are outside of our control, including the following:\n\u2022our ability to comply with all regulatory requirements applicable to our EUA, including applicable FDA marketing, manufacturing and post-market requirements and other requirements of our EUA;\n\u2022whether we are required by the FDA or other similar regulatory authorities to conduct additional clinical trials or to modify the design of our current trials to support the approval of sotrovimab;\n\u2022the receipt of additional marketing authorizations and approvals from the FDA and other similar regulatory authorities;\n\u2022our ability to achieve and maintain compliance with all regulatory requirements applicable to sotrovimab;\n\u2022perceptions by the public and members of the medical community, including physicians, as to the safety and efficacy of sotrovimab as well as the accuracy and sufficiency of clinical evidence supporting its performance;\n\u2022demand from the public and members of the medical community for sotrovimab;\n\u2022the availability, perceived advantages, relative cost, relative convenience and relative efficacy of sotrovimab compared to other COVID-19 therapies as well as the accuracy and sufficiency of clinical evidence supporting its performance;\n\u2022the ability of sotrovimab to be effective in patients with COVID-19 and its variants;\n\u2022positive or negative media coverage of sotrovimab;\n\u2022the effectiveness of our marketing and sales efforts;\n\u2022our ability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms, or at all, if needed to support the commercialization of sotrovimab;\n\u2022the ability to enter into additional procurement contracts with government entities, and our ability to meet our obligations under such contracts;\n\u2022our reliance on GSK and other collaborators for development, commercialization and manufacturing of sotrovimab;\n\u2022our ability to obtain, maintain and enforce our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022our ability to maintain a continued supply of sotrovimab that meets our quality control requirements;\n\u2022the ability of third-party manufacturing partners to meet demand in a timely manner, in accordance with our specifications, and in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements;\n\u2022limitation on use or warnings required by the FDA;\n\u2022our current and future arrangements with healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors; and\n\u2022availability of, or changes in, coverage or reimbursement rates for sotrovimab from government or other commercial or healthcare payors.\nIn addition, COVID-19 treatment standards are susceptible to rapid changes in epidemiology and the emergence of new variants, thus, sotrovimab may be rendered inferior or obsolete, even if it were to gain widespread market acceptance initially. Initial feedback from the FDA question our conclusion that the 500 mg IV dose of sotrovimab retains activity against the BA.2 Omicron subvariant based on our current modeling assumptions, and the FDA has asked for additional data to support our position. The FDA also requested safety data for higher doses. Both have been provided to the FDA and we are awaiting further correspondence. We could be required to perform additional studies and trials on sotrovimab based on any additional feedback we may receive from the FDA or the FDA could amend the terms of our EUA to limit the circumstances under which sotrovimab could be used as an early treatment for COVID-19.\nIf we are unable to successfully commercialize sotrovimab, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to the Development and Commercialization\nOur future success is substantially dependent on the successful clinical development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our EUA product and product candidates in a timely manner. If we are not able to obtain required regulatory approvals, we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates and our ability to generate product revenue will be adversely affected.\nWe have invested a significant portion of our time and financial resources in the development of our product candidates. Our business is dependent on our ability to successfully complete development of, obtain regulatory approval for, and successfully commercialize our EUA product and other product candidates, if approved, in a timely manner. We may face unforeseen challenges in our product development strategy, and we can provide no assurances that our product candidates will be successful in clinical trials or will ultimately receive regulatory approval.\nWe initiated clinical trials for multiple product candidates. Sotrovimab has received an EUA from the FDA and marketing authorization in the EU. To date, sotrovimab has been granted EUA, temporary authorization or marketing approval (under the brand name Xevudy\u00ae) in more than 40 countries. The FDA may, under certain circumstances, revise or revoke an EUA. If our EUA is terminated or revoked, sotrovimab will no longer be available in the United States unless and until we have obtained FDA approval of a BLA for the product. We have not obtained BLA approval for sotrovimab or any other product candidate to date. We operate in a highly regulated field, and it is possible that any product candidate we may seek to develop in the future will not obtain regulatory approval.\nPrior to obtaining approval to commercialize any product candidate in the United States or abroad, we must demonstrate with substantial evidence from well-controlled clinical trials, and to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, that such product candidate is safe and effective for its intended uses. Results from preclinical studies and clinical trials can be interpreted in different ways. Even if we believe that the preclinical or clinical data for our product candidates are promising, such data may not be sufficient to support approval for further development, manufacturing or commercialization of our product candidates by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. The FDA may also require us to conduct additional preclinical studies or clinical trials for our product candidates either prior to or post-approval, or it may object to elements of our clinical development program, requiring their alteration.\nEven if we eventually complete clinical testing and receive approval of a new drug application, or NDA, BLA, or foreign marketing application for our product candidates, the FDA or the comparable foreign regulatory authorities may grant approval or other marketing authorization contingent on the performance of costly additional clinical trials, including post-market clinical trials. The FDA or the comparable foreign regulatory authorities also may approve or authorize for marketing a product candidate for a more limited indication or patient population than we originally request, and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may not approve or authorize the labeling that we believe is necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of a product candidate. Any delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, applicable regulatory approval or other marketing authorization would delay or prevent commercialization of that product candidate and would adversely impact our business and prospects.\nIn addition, the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may change their policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations or take other actions, which may prevent or delay approval of our future product candidates under development on a timely basis. Such policy or regulatory changes could impose additional requirements upon us that could delay our ability to obtain applicable regulatory approvals, increase the costs of compliance or restrict our ability to maintain any marketing authorizations we may have obtained.\nFurthermore, even if we obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, we may still need to develop a commercial organization, establish a commercially viable pricing structure and obtain approval for coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party and government payors, including government health administration authorities. If we are unable to successfully commercialize our product candidates or if there is an insufficient demand for our product candidates, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to continue our business.\nThe development of additional product candidates is risky and uncertain, and we can provide no assurances that we will be able to replicate our approach for other diseases.\nA core element of our business strategy is to expand our product candidate pipeline. Efforts to identify, acquire or in-license, and then develop product candidates require substantial technical, financial and human resources, whether or not any product candidates are ultimately identified. Our efforts may initially show promise in identifying potential product candidates, yet fail to yield product candidates for clinical development, approved products or commercial revenue for many reasons.\nWe have limited financial and management resources and, as a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications that later prove to have greater market potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, strategic alliances, licensing or other royalty arrangements in circumstances under which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate. In addition, we may not be successful in replicating our approach to development for other disease indications. If we are unsuccessful in identifying and developing additional product candidates or are unable to do so, our business may be harmed.\nWe are developing, and in the future may develop, other product candidates in combination with other therapies, which exposes us to additional risks.\nWe are developing VIR-2218 and VIR-3434 for the functional cure of hepatitis B virus, or HBV. Each of these product candidates has the potential to stimulate an effective immune response and also has direct antiviral activity against HBV. We believe that a functional cure for HBV will require an effective immune response, in addition to antiviral activity, based on the observation that severe immunosuppression can reactivate HBV disease. Monotherapy with each of these agents may provide a functional cure in some patients, while combination therapy may be necessary for others. We have an ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial that combines VIR-2218 with pegylated interferon-alpha and a Phase 2 clinical trial that combines VIR-2218 with VIR-3434. We are also evaluating additional combinations with other immunotherapy agents and direct acting antiviral agents. Even if any product candidate we develop were to receive marketing approval or be commercialized for use in combination with other existing therapies, we would continue to be subject to the risks that the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could revoke approval of the therapy used in combination with our product candidate. There is also a risk that safety, efficacy, manufacturing or supply issues could arise with these other existing therapies. This could result in our own products being removed from the market or being less successful commercially.\nWe may also evaluate our future product candidates in combination with one or more other therapies that have not yet been approved for marketing by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. We will not be able to market any product candidate we develop in combination with any such unapproved therapies that do not ultimately obtain marketing approval.\nIf the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities do not approve these other drugs or revoke their approval of, or if safety, efficacy, manufacturing or supply issues arise with, the drugs we choose to evaluate in combination with any product candidate we develop, we may be unable to obtain approval.\nSuccess in preclinical studies or earlier clinical trials may not be indicative of results in future clinical trials and we cannot assure you that any ongoing, planned or future clinical trials will lead to results sufficient for the necessary regulatory approvals and market authorizations.\nSuccess in preclinical testing and earlier clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will generate the same results or otherwise provide adequate data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of a product candidate. Success in preclinical studies and earlier clinical trials does not ensure that later efficacy trials will be successful, nor does it predict final results. Our product candidates may fail to show the desired characteristics in clinical development sufficient to obtain regulatory approval, despite positive results in preclinical studies or having successfully advanced through earlier clinical trials.\nA trial design that is considered appropriate for regulatory approval includes a sufficiently large sample size with appropriate statistical power, as well as proper control of bias, to allow a meaningful interpretation of the results. If we do not conduct clinical trials with a large enough patient sample size, we may not achieve statistically significant results or the same level of statistical significance, if any, that would have been possible to achieve in a larger trial.\nAs an organization, we have limited experience designing clinical trials and may be unable to design and execute a clinical trial to support regulatory approval, which could mean we will suffer setbacks. Any such setbacks could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nInterim, \u201ctop-line\u201d and preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time may change as more patient data become available and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data.\nFrom time to time, we may publish interim, \u201ctop-line\u201d or preliminary data from our clinical trials. Interim data from clinical trials that we may complete are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available. Preliminary or \u201ctop-line\u201d data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published. As a result, interim and preliminary data should be viewed with caution until the final data is available. Differences between preliminary or interim data and final data could significantly harm our business prospects and may cause the trading price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly.\nClinical product development involves a lengthy and expensive process. We may incur additional costs and encounter substantial delays or difficulties in our clinical trials.\nWe may not commercialize, market, promote or sell any product candidate without obtaining marketing approval from the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authority, and we may never receive such approvals. It is impossible to predict when or if any of our product candidates will prove effective or safe in humans and will receive regulatory approval. Before obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of our product candidates, we must complete preclinical development and then conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans. Clinical testing is expensive, is difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. We cannot guarantee that any clinical trials will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their products. We may experience numerous unforeseen events prior to, during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize our product candidates.\nAny inability to successfully complete preclinical and clinical development could result in additional costs to us or impair our ability to generate revenue from future product sales or other sources. In addition, if we make manufacturing or formulation changes to our product candidates, we may need to conduct additional testing to bridge our modified product candidate to earlier versions. Clinical trial delays could also shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates, if approved, or allow our competitors to bring competing products to market before we do, which could impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and may harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nAdditionally, if the results of our clinical trials are inconclusive or if there are safety concerns or serious adverse events associated with our product candidates, we may:\n\u2022be delayed in obtaining marketing approval, or not obtain marketing approval at all;\n\u2022obtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired;\n\u2022obtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings;\n\u2022be subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements;\n\u2022be required to perform additional clinical trials to support approval or be subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements;\n\u2022have regulatory authorities withdraw, or suspend, their approval of the product or impose restrictions on its distribution in the form of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS;\n\u2022be subject to the addition of labeling statements, such as warnings or contraindications;\n\u2022be sued; or\n\u2022experience damage to our reputation.\nOur product development costs will also increase if we experience delays in testing or obtaining marketing approvals. We do not know whether any of our preclinical studies or clinical trials will begin as planned, need to be restructured or be completed on schedule, if at all.\nFurthermore, our product candidates are based on certain innovative technology platforms, which makes it even more difficult to predict the time and cost of product candidate development and obtaining necessary regulatory approvals, particularly for our small interfering ribonucleic acid, or siRNA, and cytomegalovirus, or CMV, vector technologies. Relatively few siRNA product candidates have ever been tested in humans and to date few have received regulatory approval and market authorizations. In addition, the compounds we are developing may not demonstrate in patients the chemical and pharmacological properties ascribed to them in preclinical studies, and they may interact with human biological systems in unforeseen, ineffective or harmful ways.\nAs part of our T cell platform, our approach is to use human CMV, or HCMV, as a vaccine vector to potentially treat and prevent pathogens refractory to current vaccine technologies because HCMV may induce potent and long-lasting T cell responses to a broader range of epitopes than observed for other viral vaccines. Safety and toxicity trials for this technology have so far only been conducted in animal species, in which HCMV has limited ability to replicate. If our first clinical trial for VIR-1111 causes unexpected side effects that are not tolerable in the treatment of the relevant patient group, the further development of the product candidates and any other potential products based on HCMV-vector technology may be significantly limited or become impossible. Also, because our HCMV-vector technology is novel, regulatory agencies may lack experience with product candidates such as VIR-1111, which may lengthen the regulatory review process, increase our development costs and delay or prevent commercialization of our product candidates. In addition, our HCMV-vector technology utilizes live-attenuated, genetically-modified organisms for which the FDA, the EMA, and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities and other public health authorities, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and hospitals involved in clinical trials, have established additional safety and contagion rules and procedures, which could establish additional hurdles for the development, manufacture or use of our vectors. These hurdles may lead to delays in the conduct of clinical trials or in obtaining regulatory approvals for further development, manufacturing or commercialization of our product candidates.\nFurther, we, the FDA, a foreign regulatory authority or an institutional review board may place a full or partial hold on our clinical trials at any time if it appears that we or our collaborators are failing to conduct a trial in accordance with regulatory requirements, including the FDA\u2019s current Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, regulations, that we are exposing participants to unacceptable health risks, or if the FDA or foreign regulatory authority finds deficiencies in our investigational new drug, or IND, applications or clinical trial applications, respectively, or the conduct of these trials. Moreover, we may not be able to file INDs to commence additional clinical trials on the timelines we expect because our filing schedule is dependent on further preclinical and manufacturing progress. Therefore, we cannot predict with any certainty the schedule for commencement and completion of future clinical trials. If we experience delays in the commencement or completion of our clinical trials, or if we terminate a clinical trial prior to completion, the commercial prospects of our product candidates could be negatively impacted, and our ability to generate revenue from our product candidates may be delayed.\nEnrollment and retention of patients in clinical trials is an expensive and time-consuming process and could be delayed, made more difficult or rendered impossible by multiple factors outside our control.\nIdentifying and qualifying patients to participate in our clinical trials is critical to our success. We are developing sotrovimab and VIR-7832 for the treatment of COVID-19, VIR-2218 and VIR-3434 for the treatment of HBV, VIR-2482 for the prevention of influenza A, and VIR-1111 for the prevention of human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV. In particular, clinical trials for prophylaxis tend to require enrollment of a larger number of subjects than clinical trials for treatments. We may encounter difficulties in enrolling patients in our clinical trials, thereby delaying or preventing development and approval of our product candidates. Even once enrolled, we may be unable to retain a sufficient number of patients to complete any of our trials. Patient enrollment and retention in clinical trials depend on many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the trial protocol, the existing body of safety and efficacy data, the number and nature of competing treatments and ongoing clinical trials of competing therapies for the same indication, the proximity of patients to clinical sites and the eligibility criteria for the trial. The enrollment and retention of patients in the clinical trials for sotrovimab and VIR-7832 for the treatment of COVID-19 may be disrupted or delayed as a result of clinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages of sotrovimab and VIR-7832 in relation to other available therapies, including products that have been recently authorized under EUAs or approved and licensed through NDAs and BLAs to treat COVID-19 as well as any other new products that may be approved in the future for the treatment of COVID-19. While we have active clinical trial sites in the Ukraine and nearby European countries, if political or civil conditions require it, our sites may need to delay or suspend clinical trial activities. In addition, enrollment and retention of patients in clinical trials could be disrupted by geopolitical events, including civil or political unrest (such as the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia), terrorism, insurrection or war, man-made or natural disasters, or public health pandemics or epidemics or other business interruptions, including, the current COVID-19 pandemic and future outbreaks of the disease.\nOur efforts to build relationships with patient communities may not succeed, which could result in delays in patient enrollment in our clinical trials. Any negative results we may report in clinical trials of our product candidates may make it difficult or impossible to recruit and retain patients in other clinical trials of that same product candidate. Delays or failures in planned patient enrollment or retention may result in increased costs, program delays or both, which could have a harmful effect on our ability to develop our product candidates or could render further development impossible. In addition, we may rely on contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites to ensure proper and timely conduct of our future clinical trials and, while we intend to enter into agreements governing their services, we will be limited in our ability to ensure their actual performance.\nThe continued spread of COVID-19 globally, or the evolution of new variants of COVID-19 that are more contagious, have more severe effects or are resistant to treatments or vaccinations, could adversely impact our preclinical or clinical trial operations in the United States, including our ability to enroll and retain patients as well as CROs and clinical trial site staff who, as healthcare providers, may have heightened exposure to COVID-19 if an outbreak occurs in their geography. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA issued guidance on March 18, 2020, and subsequently updated it, to address the conduct of clinical trials during the pandemic. The guidance sets out a number of considerations for sponsors of clinical trials impacted by the pandemic, including the requirement to include in the clinical study report (or as a separate document) contingency measures implemented to manage the study, and any disruption of the study as a result of COVID-19; a list of all study participants affected by COVID-19-related study disruptions by a unique subject identifier and by investigational site, and a description of how the individual\u2019s participation was altered; and analyses and corresponding discussions that address the impact of implemented contingency measures (e.g., participant discontinuation from investigational product and/or study, alternative procedures used to collect critical safety and/or efficacy data) on the safety and efficacy results reported for the study. There is no assurance that this guidance governing clinical studies during the pandemic will remain in effect or, even if it does, that it will help address the risks and challenges enumerated above. Accordingly, an inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for the clinical trials would result in significant delays or might require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether.\nOur product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit their commercial potential or result in significant negative consequences following any potential marketing approval.\nDuring the conduct of clinical trials, patients report changes in their health, including illnesses, injuries and discomforts, to their doctor. Often, it is not possible to determine whether or not the product candidate being studied caused these conditions. Regulatory authorities may draw different conclusions and may require us to pause our clinical trials or require additional testing to confirm these determinations, if they occur.\nIn addition, it is possible that as we test our product candidates in larger, longer and more extensive clinical trials, or as use of these product candidates becomes more widespread if they receive regulatory approval, illnesses, injuries, discomforts and other adverse events that were not observed in earlier trials, as well as conditions that did not occur or went undetected in\nprevious trials, will be reported by subjects or patients. Many times, side effects are only detectable after investigational products are tested in large-scale pivotal trials or, in some cases, after they are made available to patients on a commercial scale after approval. If additional clinical experience indicates that any of our product candidates have side effects or cause serious or life-threatening side effects, the development of the product candidate may fail or be delayed, or, if the product candidate has received regulatory approval, such approval may be revoked, which would harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe are a party to strategic collaboration and license agreements pursuant to which we are obligated to make substantial payments upon achievement of milestone events and, in certain cases, have relinquished important rights over the development and commercialization of certain current and future product candidates. We also intend to explore additional strategic collaborations, which may never materialize or may require that we relinquish rights to and control over the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe are a party to various strategic collaboration and license agreements that are important to our business and to our current and future product candidates pursuant to which we license a number of technologies to form our technology platforms. These agreements contain obligations that require us to make substantial payments in the event certain milestone events are achieved. We may in the future be required to make these payments, which could adversely affect our financial condition. In addition, we cannot be certain that we will achieve the results or benefits that justify entering into these agreements. For additional information regarding these and other collaboration, license and grant agreements, see the section titled \u201cBusiness-Our Collaboration, License and Grant Agreements.\u201d\nA core element of our business strategy also includes continuing to acquire or in-license additional technologies or product candidates for the treatment and prevention of serious infectious diseases. As a result, we intend to periodically explore a variety of possible strategic collaborations or licenses in an effort to gain access to additional product candidates, technologies or resources.\nAt this time, we cannot predict what form such strategic collaborations or licenses might take in the future. We are likely to face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic collaborators, and strategic collaborations and licenses can be complicated and time-consuming to negotiate and document. We may not be able to negotiate strategic collaborations on acceptable terms, or at all. We are unable to predict when, if ever, we will enter into any additional strategic collaborations or licenses because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with establishing them. Any delays in entering into new strategic collaborations or licenses related to our product candidates could delay the development and commercialization of our product candidates in certain geographies for certain indications, which would harm our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur current and future strategic collaborations and licenses could subject us to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022we may be required to undertake the expenditure of substantial operational, financial and management resources;\n\u2022we may be required to assume substantial actual or contingent liabilities;\n\u2022we may not be able to control the amount and timing of resources that our strategic collaborators devote to the development or commercialization of our product candidates;\n\u2022strategic collaborators may select indications or design clinical trials in a way that may be less successful than if we were doing so;\n\u2022strategic collaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding, terminate a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new version of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\u2022strategic collaborators may not pursue further development and commercialization of products resulting from the strategic collaboration arrangement or may elect to discontinue research and development programs;\n\u2022disputes may arise between us and our strategic collaborators that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management\u2019s attention and consumes resources;\n\u2022strategic collaborators may experience financial difficulties;\n\u2022strategic collaborators may not properly maintain, enforce or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in a manner that could jeopardize or invalidate our proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation; and\n\u2022strategic collaborators could terminate the arrangement or allow it to expire, which would delay the development and may increase the cost of developing our product candidates.\nFurthermore, license agreements we enter into in the future may not provide exclusive rights to use intellectual property and technology in all relevant fields of use and in all territories in which we may wish to develop or commercialize our technology and products. As a result, we may not be able to prevent competitors from developing and commercializing competitive products in territories included in all of our licenses.\nIf the market opportunities for our product candidates are smaller than we believe they are or any approval we obtain is based on a narrower definition of the patient population, our business may suffer.\nWe currently focus our product development on product candidates for the treatment and prevention of serious infectious diseases. Our eligible patient population, pricing estimates and available coverage and reimbursement may differ significantly from the actual market addressable by our product candidates. Our estimates of the number of people who have these diseases, the subset of people with these diseases who have the potential to benefit from treatment with our product candidates, and the market demand for our product candidates are based on our beliefs and analyses. These estimates have been derived from a variety of sources, including the scientific literature, patient foundations or market research, and may prove to be incorrect. Further, new trials may change the estimated incidence or prevalence of the diseases we are targeting. The number of patients may turn out to be lower than expected. Likewise, the potentially addressable patient population for each of our product candidates may be limited or may not be receptive to treatment with our product candidates, and new patients may become increasingly difficult to identify or access. Additionally, the availability of superior or competitive therapies from our competitors could negatively impact or eliminate market demand for our product candidates. If the market opportunities for our product candidates are smaller than we estimate, it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than us.\nThe biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and an emphasis on proprietary products. We face potential competition from many different sources, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions.\nOur commercialization potential could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than products that we may develop. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all our programs are likely to be efficacy, safety, convenience and timing. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.\nIn addition, regulatory incentives to develop products for treatment of infectious diseases have increased interest and activity in this area and may lead to increased competition for clinical investigators and clinical trial subjects, as well as for future prescriptions, if any of our product candidates are successfully developed and approved.\nOur competitors may have significantly greater financial resources, established presence in the market, expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical and clinical testing, obtaining regulatory approvals and reimbursement and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in acquiring third-party contract manufacturing capacity and raw materials, recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, sales, marketing and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Additional mergers and acquisitions may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors.\nSince the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, and even before, there has been substantial research in the development of new drugs and biologics to address diseases caused by the coronavirus. Numerous large and small\npharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are developing COVID-19 therapy programs with various mechanisms of actions, including prophylactic vaccines, oral antivirals, immunomodulators, and antibodies, some of which are further along in the development process than we are. Other parties may be successful in producing a more efficacious therapy for SARS-CoV-2 or in producing a therapy that is easier to deliver and administer to patients in a timelier manner, which may also lead to the diversion of funding away from us and toward other companies or lead to decreased demand for our potential therapies. Companies with antibodies in clinical development include AbbVie, Inc., Adagio Therapeutics, or Adagio, AstraZeneca plc, or AstraZeneca, Brii Bio, Celltrion Healthcare Co., Ltd., Eli Lilly and Company, or Eli Lilly, and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Companies with oral antivirals in clinical development include Shionogi Inc., Gilead Sciences, Inc., or Gilead, and others. Companies with prophylactic vaccines in clinical development include AstraZeneca, GSK, Novavax, Inc. and Sanofi S.A. The industry and competitive landscape for COVID-19 treatments is rapidly changing, and we could have more competition in the future.\nThe availability of superior or competitive therapies, or preventative measures such as vaccines, coupled with the unpredictable nature of pandemics and the prevalence of new variants of COVID-19, could negatively impact or eliminate demand for our COVID-19 therapies. Product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize may compete with existing therapies, including prophylactic vaccines, competing antibody therapies, oral antivirals, and new therapies that may become available in the future. In addition, one or more of our competitors may be successful in producing a more efficacious therapy for SARS-CoV-2 and current and future variants or in producing a therapy that is easier to deliver and administer to patients in a timelier manner. For example, there are FDA-approved treatments for COVID-19 including an intravenously administered antiviral, remdesivir, marketed by Gilead, which is FDA approved for the treatment of COVID-19 in both outpatient and hospitalized settings, and several treatments and a prophylactic vaccine are available under EUA. Additionally, Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine, Comirnaty\u00ae, is approved by the FDA for individuals 16 years of age or older, Moderna, Inc.\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine, Spikevax\u00ae, is approved by the FDA for individuals 18 years of age or older and a COVID-19 vaccine is available in the United States under EUA from Janssen Biotech, Inc. In December 2021 the FDA approved EUAs for the oral antiviral, molnupiravir, from Merck & Co., Inc., or Merck, for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing, and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death, and for whom alternative COVID-19 treatment options authorized by the FDA are not accessible or clinically appropriate, which has shown topline efficacy of 30% reduction in risk for hospitalization or death risk in early treatment clinical trials, and the oral antiviral, paxlovid, from Pfizer for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kilograms) with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 testing, and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death, which has demonstrated an 89% reduction in risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization or death. In February 2022, the FDA approved an EUA for Eli Lilly's antibody, bebtelovimab, for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kilograms) with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 testing, and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death. Merck, Pfizer and Eli Lilly have all been successful in securing government support and funding. AstraZeneca\u2019s AZD7442, a cocktail of two monoclonal antibodies, showed topline efficacy of 50% reduction in risk for hospitalization or death risk in early treatment clinical trials. Other companies like AstraZeneca and Adagio have been successful in securing government support and funding, respectively, and are in the process of developing antibody therapies that, if successful, could be effective against known viral variants and be administered via intramuscular, or IM, injection.\nAs a result of these factors, our competitors may achieve patent protection or obtain regulatory approval of their products before we are able to, which may limit our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates. Our competitors may also develop therapies that are safer, more effective, more widely accepted or less expensive than ours, and may also be more successful than we are in manufacturing and marketing their products. These advantages could render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the costs of such product candidates\u2019 development and commercialization. For additional information regarding our competitors, see the section titled \u201cBusiness-Competition.\u201d\nEven if any product candidates receive marketing approval, they may fail to achieve market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors or others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.\nTo date, sotrovimab has been granted EUA, temporary authorization or marketing approval (under the brand name Xevudy\u00ae) in more than 40 countries. Even if any product candidates receive marketing approval, they may fail to gain market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community. If such product candidates do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenue and may not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of any product candidate, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022the convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments and therapies;\n\u2022the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;\n\u2022the efficacy and potential advantages compared to alternative treatments and therapies;\n\u2022the effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts;\n\u2022the strength of our relationships with patient communities;\n\u2022the cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments and therapies, including any similar generic treatments;\n\u2022our ability to offer such product for sale at competitive prices;\n\u2022the strength of marketing and distribution support;\n\u2022the availability of third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement, and patients\u2019 willingness to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of third-party coverage or adequate reimbursement;\n\u2022the prevalence and severity of any side effects; and\n\u2022any restrictions on the use of the product together with other medications.\nIf any of our product candidates are approved but fail to achieve market acceptance among physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community, we will not be able to generate significant revenue, which would compromise our ability to become profitable.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates, they will remain subject to ongoing regulatory oversight.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval in a jurisdiction, the regulatory authority may still impose significant restrictions on the indicated uses or marketing of our product candidates, or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval trials, post-market surveillance or patient or drug restrictions. Additionally, the holder of an approved BLA is required to comply with FDA rules and is subject to FDA review and periodic inspections, in addition to other potentially applicable federal and state laws, to ensure compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, and adherence to commitments made in the BLA.\nIf we or a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions relative to that product or the manufacturing facility, including requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing. Moreover, product labeling, advertising and promotion for any approved product will be subject to regulatory requirements and continuing regulatory review. For example, a company may not promote \u201coff-label\u201d uses for its drug products. An off-label use is the use of a product for an indication that is not described in the product\u2019s FDA-approved or authorized label in the United States or for uses in other jurisdictions that differ from those approved by the applicable regulatory agencies. Physicians, on the other hand, may prescribe products for off-label uses. Although the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory agencies do not regulate a physician\u2019s choice of drug treatment made in the physician\u2019s independent medical judgment, they do restrict promotional communications from companies or their sales force with respect to off-label uses of products for which marketing clearance has not been issued.\nFailure to comply with such requirements, when and if applicable, could subject us to a number of actions ranging from warning letters to product seizures or significant fines, among other actions. The FDA and other agencies, including the Department of Justice, or the DOJ, closely regulate and monitor the post-approval marketing and promotion of products to ensure that they are marketed and distributed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. The FDA and DOJ impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers\u2019 communications regarding off-label use and if we market our medicines for uses other than their respective approved indications, we may be subject to enforcement action for off-label marketing. Violations of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and other statutes, including the False Claims Act, relating to the promotion and advertising of prescription drugs may lead to investigations and enforcement actions alleging violations of federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws, as well as state consumer protection laws, which violations may result in the imposition of significant administrative, civil and criminal penalties. Any government investigation of alleged violations of laws or regulations could require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate negative publicity. The occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate revenue. For additional information regarding regulatory approval and ongoing regulatory oversight, see the section titled \u201cBusiness-Government Regulation and Product Approval.\u201d\nIf we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates, we may not be successful in commercializing them, if and when they are approved.\nTo successfully commercialize any product candidate that may result from our development programs, we will need to build out our sales and marketing capabilities, either on our own or with others. The establishment and development of our own commercial team or the establishment of a contract sales force to market any product candidate we may develop will be expensive and time-consuming and could delay any product launch. Moreover, we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully develop this capability, and have no experience as a company in commercializing products. Establishing sales and marketing capabilities will be particularly important to the commercial success of our product candidates that target diseases with large patient populations throughout the world. We may seek to enter into collaboration agreements with other entities to utilize their established marketing and distribution capabilities, but we may be unable to enter into such agreements on favorable terms, if at all. For example, GSK is primarily responsible for the commercialization of sotrovimab. If any current or future collaborators, including GSK, do not commit sufficient time or resources to commercialize our product candidates, or we are unable to develop the necessary capabilities on our own, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to sustain our business. We compete with many companies that currently have extensive, experienced and well-funded marketing and sales operations to recruit, hire, train and retain marketing and sales personnel, and will have to compete with those companies to recruit, hire, train and retain any of our own marketing and sales personnel. We will likely also face competition if we seek third parties to assist us with the sales and marketing efforts of our product candidates. Without an internal team or the support of a third party to perform marketing and sales functions, we may be unable to compete successfully against these more established companies.\nEven if we obtain and maintain approval for our product candidates from the FDA, we may never obtain approval outside the United States, which would limit our market opportunities.\nApproval of a product candidate in the United States by the FDA does not ensure approval of such product candidate by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA. Sales of our product candidates outside the United States will be subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing clinical trials and marketing approval. Even if the FDA grants marketing approval for a product candidate, comparable foreign regulatory authorities also must approve the manufacturing and marketing of the product candidate in those countries. Approval procedures vary among jurisdictions and can involve requirements and administrative review periods different from, and more onerous than, those in the United States, including additional preclinical studies or clinical trials. In many countries outside the United States, a product candidate must be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that country. In some cases, the price that we intend to charge for any product candidates, if approved, is also subject to approval. Obtaining approval for our product candidates in the EU from the European Commission following the opinion of the EMA if we choose to submit a marketing authorization application there, would be a lengthy and expensive process. Even if a product candidate is approved, the EMA may limit the indications for which the product may be marketed, require extensive warnings on the product labeling or require expensive and time-consuming additional clinical trials or reporting as conditions of approval. Approval of certain product candidates outside of the United States, particularly those that target diseases that are more prevalent outside of the United States will be particularly important to the commercial success of such product candidates. Obtaining foreign regulatory approvals and compliance with foreign regulatory requirements could result in significant delays, difficulties and costs for us and could delay or prevent the introduction of our product candidates in certain countries.\nIn addition, on June 23, 2016, the electorate in the U.K. voted in favor of leaving the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit. Following protracted negotiations, the U.K. left the EU on January 31, 2020, and a transition period to December 31, 2020, was established to allow the U.K. and the EU to negotiate the U.K.\u2019s withdrawal. As a result, effective January 1, 2021, the U.K. is no longer part of the European Single Market and European Union Customs Union. A co-operation agreement was signed between the U.K. and the EU in December 2020 which has been applied provisionally since January 1, 2021, until it is ratified by all parties to that agreement. The agreement addresses trade, economic arrangements, law enforcement, judicial cooperation and a governance framework including procedures for dispute resolution, among other things. As both parties continue to work on the rules for implementation, significant political and economic uncertainty remains about how the precise terms of the relationship between the parties will differ from the terms before withdrawal.\nSince the regulatory framework for pharmaceutical products in the U.K. covering the quality, safety, and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales, and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from EU directives and regulations, the consequences of Brexit and the impact the future regulatory regime that applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the U.K. remains unclear. As of January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or the MHRA, became responsible for supervising medicines and\nmedical devices in Great Britain, comprising England, Scotland and Wales under domestic law, whereas Northern Ireland will continue to be subject to EU rules under the Northern Ireland Protocol. The MHRA will rely on the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (SI 2012/1916) (as amended), or the HMR, as the basis for regulating medicines. The HMR has incorporated into the domestic law of the body of EU law instruments governing medicinal products that pre-existed prior to the U.K.\u2019s withdrawal from the EU. Any delay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, any marketing approvals, as a result of Brexit or otherwise, may force us to restrict or delay efforts to seek regulatory approval in the U.K. for our product candidates, which could significantly and materially harm our business.\nFurther, clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries. Also, regulatory approval for our product candidates may be withdrawn. If we fail to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our product candidates will be harmed and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be harmed.\nIf we commercialize our product candidates outside the United States, a variety of risks associated with international operations could harm our business.\nWe intend to seek approval to market our product candidates outside the United States, and may also do so for future product candidates. If we market approved products outside the United States, we expect that we will be subject to additional risks in commercialization.\nWe have no prior experience in these areas. In addition, there are complex regulatory, tax, labor and other legal requirements imposed by many of the individual countries in which we may operate, with which we will need to comply. Many biopharmaceutical companies have found the process of marketing their products in foreign countries to be challenging.\nNegative developments and negative public opinion of new technologies on which we rely may damage public perception of our product candidates or adversely affect our ability to conduct our business or obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates.\nThe clinical and commercial success of our product candidates will depend in part on public acceptance of the use of new technologies for the prevention or treatment of human diseases. For example, we use CMV, a commonly occurring virus in humans, as a vaccine vector to prevent and treat pathogens refractory to current vaccine technologies. We also use CRISPR gene-editing technology as a research tool to systematically identify human genes that control infection.\nPublic perception may be influenced by claims that CMV technology is unsafe and products incorporating this technology may not gain the acceptance of the public or the medical community, or that CRISPR gene-editing technology is unethical or immoral. Adverse public attitudes may adversely impact our ability to enroll clinical trials. Moreover, our success will depend upon physicians specializing in our targeted diseases prescribing, and their patients being willing to receive, our product candidates as treatments in lieu of, or in addition to, existing, more familiar, treatments for which greater clinical data may be available. Any increase in negative perceptions of the technologies that we rely on may result in fewer physicians prescribing our products or may reduce the willingness of patients to utilize our products or participate in clinical trials for our product candidates.\nIncreased negative public opinion or more restrictive government regulations in response thereto, would have a negative effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects and may delay or impair the development and commercialization of our product candidates or demand for such product candidates. Adverse events in our preclinical studies or clinical trials or those of our competitors or of academic researchers utilizing similar technologies, even if not ultimately attributable to product candidates we may discover and develop, and the resulting publicity could result in increased governmental regulation, unfavorable public perception, potential regulatory delays in the testing or approval of potential product candidates we may identify and develop, stricter labeling requirements for those product candidates that are approved, a decrease in demand for any such product candidates and a suspension or withdrawal of approval by regulatory authorities of our product candidates.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and could limit commercialization of any product candidate that we may develop.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our product candidates in clinical trials and may face an even greater risk if we commercialize any product candidate that we may develop. If we cannot successfully\ndefend ourselves against claims that any such product candidates caused injuries, we could incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022decreased demand for any product candidate that we may develop;\n\u2022loss of revenue;\n\u2022substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u2022significant time and costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u2022withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022increased insurance costs;\n\u2022the inability to commercialize any product candidate that we may develop; and\n\u2022injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention.\nAny such outcomes could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur insurance policies may be inadequate and potentially expose us to unrecoverable risks.\nAlthough we maintain product liability insurance coverage, such insurance may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. We anticipate that we will need to increase our insurance coverage each time we commence a clinical trial and if we successfully commercialize any product candidate. Insurance availability, coverage terms and pricing continue to vary with market conditions. We endeavor to obtain appropriate insurance coverage for insurable risks that we identify such as cybersecurity-related issues; however, we may fail to correctly anticipate or quantify insurable risks, we may not be able to obtain appropriate insurance coverage and insurers may not respond as we intend to cover insurable events that may occur. Conditions in the insurance markets relating to nearly all areas of traditional corporate insurance change rapidly and may result in higher premium costs, higher policy deductibles and lower coverage limits. For some risks, we may not have or maintain insurance coverage because of cost or availability.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Compliance\nThe regulatory pathways for our product candidates targeting SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, are continually evolving, and may result in unexpected or unforeseen challenges.\nOur product candidates targeting SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, are in various development and approval stages. To date, sotrovimab has been granted EUA, temporary authorization or marketing approval (under the brand name Xevudy\u00ae) in more than 40 countries. Sotrovimab completed a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating an IM formulation. In the second quarter of 2021, we initiated and completed an additional Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating an IM formulation of sotrovimab and a Phase 1b/2a clinical trial for VIR-7832, also a SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing mAb. The speed at which companies and institutions are acting to create and test many therapeutics and vaccines for COVID-19 is unusual, and evolving or changing plans or priorities within the FDA, including changes based on new knowledge of COVID-19, variants of the disease and how the disease affects the human body, which may significantly affect the regulatory timelines for our COVID-19 product candidates. Results from our continued development and planned clinical trials may raise new questions and require us to redesign proposed clinical trials, including revising proposed endpoints or adding new clinical trial sites or cohorts of subjects. As part of these ongoing discussions, the FDA may require us to conduct additional preclinical studies and/or clinical trials than we originally anticipated, which could result in significant delay in our development program for these product candidates. For example, the FDA has asked for additional data to support our conclusion that the 500 mg IV dose of sotrovimab retains activity against the BA.2 Omicron subvariant based on our current modeling assumptions as well as safety data for higher doses. We could be required to perform additional studies and trials on sotrovimab based on any additional feedback we may receive from the FDA.\nThe FDA has the authority to grant an EUA to allow unapproved medical products to be used in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions when, based on the totality of scientific evidence, there is evidence of effectiveness of the medical product, and there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. Our EUA for sotrovimab, for example, authorizes us to distribute sotrovimab prior to full FDA approval. However, the FDA may revoke an EUA where it is determined that the underlying public health emergency no longer exists or warrants such authorization, and we cannot predict how long, if ever, an EUA would remain in place. Such revocation could adversely impact our business in a variety of ways, including if one of our COVID-19 product candidates, such as sotrovimab, is not\nyet approved by the FDA and if we and our commercialization and manufacturing partners have invested in the commercialization and manufacturing of such product candidate under an EUA.\nIf any of our future small molecule drug product candidates obtain regulatory approval, competitors could enter the market with generic or follow-on versions of such products, which may result in a material decline in sales of affected products.\nUnder the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, a pharmaceutical manufacturer may file an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, seeking approval of a generic version of an approved, small molecule innovator drug product. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, a manufacturer may also submit an NDA under section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act that references the FDA\u2019s prior approval of the small molecule innovator product. A 505(b)(2) NDA product may be for a new or improved version of the original innovator product. The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides for certain periods of regulatory exclusivity, which preclude FDA approval (or in some circumstances, FDA filing and review) of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA. In addition to the benefits of regulatory exclusivity, an innovator NDA holder may have patents claiming the active ingredient, product formulation or an approved use of the drug, which would be listed with the product in the FDA publication, \u201cApproved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,\u201d known as the Orange Book, see the section titled \u201c-Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property- Patent terms may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our product candidates or any products approved in the future for an adequate amount of time and additional competitors could enter the market with generic or biosimilar versions of such products.\u201d\nAccordingly, if any of our future small molecule drug product candidates are approved, competitors could file ANDAs following the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for generic versions of these products or 505(b)(2) NDAs that reference our products. If competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for generics referencing our small molecule drug product candidates, such competitive products may be able to immediately compete with us in each indication for which our product candidates may have received approval. They may also be prescribed by healthcare providers for off-label uses that are otherwise protected by regulatory exclusivity. For additional information regarding competition, see the section titled \u201cBusiness-Competition.\u201d\nAny biologic, or large molecule, product candidates for which we intend to seek approval may face competition sooner than anticipated.\nIf we are successful in achieving regulatory approval to commercialize any biologic product candidate faster than our competitors, such product candidates may face competition from biosimilar products. In the United States, large molecule product candidates generally are regulated by the FDA as biologic products subject to approval and licensure under the BLA pathway. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, creates an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biologic products following the approval of an original BLA. For additional information regarding biosimilars and exclusivity, see the section titled \u201cBusiness-Government Regulation and Product Approval-Biosimilars and Regulatory Exclusivity.\u201d\nIf competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing our large molecule product candidates, if approved and after the expiration of regulatory exclusivity, such products may become subject to competition from such biosimilars, with the attendant competitive pressure and potential adverse consequences. Such competitive products may be able to immediately compete with us in each indication for which our product candidates may have received approval. In addition, the extent to which any regulatory exclusivity may apply to products authorized under an EUA is unclear. For additional information regarding competition, see the section titled \u201cBusiness-Competition\u201d.\nIn addition, we may also face competition from product candidates that receive EUA approval, which could negatively impact sales of our EUA product and other product candidates. For example, numerous large and small pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are developing COVID-19 therapy programs, including prophylactic vaccines, oral antivirals, immunomodulators, and antibodies, some of which have received full approval or EUAs from the FDA. For additional information regarding competition, see the section titled \u201c-Risks Related to the Development and Commercialization - We face substantial competition, which may result in others developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than us.\u201d\nOur relationships with customers, physicians, and third-party payors are subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, and other healthcare laws and regulations. If we are unable to comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws, we could face substantial penalties.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of our EUA product and will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our current and future arrangements with healthcare professionals, principal investigators, consultants, customers and third-party payors subject us to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws and other healthcare laws, such as the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, federal civil and criminal false claims laws, the healthcare fraud provisions of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and the Physician Payments Sunshine Act.\nThese laws may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we conduct our operations, including how we research, market, sell and distribute our EUA product and additional product candidates, if approved. For additional information regarding these laws, see the section titled \u201cBusiness-Government Regulation and Product Approval\u201d. Ensuring that our internal operations and business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will likely be costly. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices, including our relationships with physicians and other healthcare providers, some of whom are compensated in the form of stock options for consulting services provided, may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participating in government-funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of noncompliance with these laws, contractual damages, reputational harm and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.\nIf the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to significant civil, criminal or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government-funded healthcare programs. Even if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to healthcare laws and regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development, manufacturing, sales, marketing or distribution activities. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of litigation or other proceedings relating to applicable healthcare laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nCoverage and adequate reimbursement may not be available for our EUA product and any product candidates that we commercialize, if approved, which could make it difficult for us to sell profitably.\nMarket acceptance and sales of our EUA product and any product candidates that we commercialize, if approved, may depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for these product and related treatments will be available from third-party payors, including government health administration authorities, managed care organizations and other private health insurers. Third-party payors decide which therapies they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. While no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement exists in the United States, third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies. However, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for our EUA product and any product candidates that we develop will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. Therefore, one payor\u2019s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage, and adequate reimbursement, for the product. Additionally, a third-party payor\u2019s decision to provide coverage for a therapy does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Each payor determines whether or not it will provide coverage for a therapy, what amount it will pay the manufacturer for the therapy and on what tier of its formulary it will be placed. The position on a payor\u2019s list of covered drugs and biological products, or formulary, generally determines the co-payment that a patient will need to make to obtain the therapy and can strongly influence the adoption of such therapy by patients and physicians. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers prescribing such services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. In addition, because our EUA product and certain of our product candidates are physician-administered, separate reimbursement for the product itself may or may\nnot be available. Instead, the administering physician may only be reimbursed for providing the treatment or procedure in which our product is used.\nThird-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. We cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement will be available for our EUA product or any product that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Inadequate coverage and reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, our EUA product or any product for which we obtain marketing approval. If coverage and adequate reimbursement are not available, or are available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our EUA product or any product candidates that we develop.\nHealthcare legislative reform measures may have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell our EUA product or any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the U.S. federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs and improve the quality of healthcare\nWe expect that additional U.S. federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, particularly in light of the new Presidential administration, any of which could limit the amounts that the U.S. federal government will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our current or any future product candidates or additional pricing pressures. It is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, on June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA, is unconstitutional in its entirety because the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d was repealed by Congress. Thus, the ACA will remain in effect in its current form. Additionally, in August 2011, the President signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended, which, among other things, included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which began in 2013 and, following passage of subsequent legislation, including the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, will continue through 2031. However, pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, and subsequent legislation, these Medicare sequester reductions have been suspended through the end of March 2022. From April 2022 through June 2022 a 1% sequester cut will be in effect, with the full 2% cut resuming thereafter. Further, in February 2021 the FDA issued guidance strongly recommending that individual monoclonal antibody products be developed with the expectation that they will be combined with one or more monoclonal antibody products that bind to different epitopes to minimize the risk of losing activity against emergent variants. This type of government action could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nAdditionally, as a result of litigation challenging the interim final rule implementing President Trump\u2019s Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, on August 10, 2021, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, published a proposed rule that seeks to rescind the Most Favored Nation Model interim final rule. In July 2021 the Biden administration released an executive order, \u201cPromoting Competition in the American Economy,\u201d with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to President Biden\u2019s executive order, on September 9, 2021, the U.S. Department of HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue to advance these principles. In addition, Congress is considering drug pricing as part of the budget reconciliation process. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action will be taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action in the United States or any other jurisdiction. If we or any third parties we may engage are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing or new requirements or policies, or if we or such third parties are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, our current or any future product candidates we may develop may lose any regulatory approval or marketing authorizations that may have been obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability. For additional information regarding other healthcare legislative reform measures, see the section titled \u201cBusiness-Government Regulation and Product Approval-Healthcare Reform\u201d.\nWe expect that these and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for our EUA product and any approved product, which could have an adverse effect on demand for our EUA product and other product candidates. Any\nreduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our products.\nWe are subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering, and similar laws, and non-compliance with such laws can subject us to criminal and/or civil liability and harm our business.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, the U.S. Travel Act and other anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in the countries in which we conduct activities. Anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws have been enforced aggressively in recent years and are interpreted broadly to generally prohibit companies and their employees and third-party intermediaries from authorizing, offering or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to recipients in the public or private sector. We interact with officials and employees of government agencies and government-affiliated hospitals, universities and other organizations. In addition, we may engage third-party intermediaries to promote our clinical research activities abroad or to obtain necessary permits, licenses and other regulatory approvals. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, collaborators and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities.\nWhile we have policies and procedures to address compliance with such laws in the United States, we cannot assure you that all of our employees and agents will not take actions in violation of our policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. Detecting, investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations can require a significant diversion of time, resources and attention from senior management. In addition, noncompliance with anti-corruption, anti-bribery or anti-money laundering laws could subject us to whistleblower complaints, investigations, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, other enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, significant fines, damages, other civil and criminal penalties or injunctions, suspension and/or debarment from contracting with certain persons, the loss of export privileges, reputational harm, adverse media coverage and other collateral consequences. If any subpoenas or investigations are launched, or governmental or other sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially harmed. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a materially significant diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees. Enforcement actions and sanctions could further harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe intend to rely on third parties to produce clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates.\nWe are currently manufacturing material for product candidates of three different modalities: mAbs, HCMV-based vaccines and siRNAs. Except for limited process development and quality control testing capabilities in certain of our facilities, we do not own or operate facilities for full process development or product manufacturing, storage and distribution, or testing. We are dependent on third parties to develop the manufacturing process and manufacture the clinical supplies of our current and any future product candidates. We have established relationships with multiple contract development and manufacturing organizations, or CDMOs, that have produced material to support our preclinical, Phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical trials. We have limited experience manufacturing our product candidates on a commercial scale, and we do not yet have sufficient information to reliably estimate the cost of the commercial manufacturing of our future product candidates. Certain of our product candidates may have to compete with existing and future products, such as the annual flu vaccine or any current or future COVID-19 vaccine, that may have a lower price point. The actual cost to manufacture our product candidates could materially and adversely affect the commercial viability of our product candidates.\nThe facilities used by third-party manufacturers to manufacture our product candidates must be approved by the FDA pursuant to inspections that will be conducted after we submit our NDA or BLA to the FDA. We do not control the manufacturing process of, and are completely dependent on, third-party manufacturers for compliance with the cGMP requirements. If our third-party manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or others, we will not be able to secure and/or maintain regulatory approval for our product candidates. In addition, we have no control over the ability of our third-party manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our product candidates or if it withdraws any such approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market our product candidates, if approved. Any significant delay in the supply of a product\ncandidate, or the raw material components thereof, for an ongoing clinical trial due to the need to replace a third-party manufacturer could considerably delay completion of our clinical trials, product testing and potential regulatory approval of our product candidates.\nWe also intend to rely on third-party manufacturers to supply us with sufficient quantities of our product candidates to be used, if approved, for commercialization. There is, however, no assurance that our third-party manufacturers will meet our working assumptions of manufacturing titer and yield per batch of our product candidates. Any reduction in anticipated manufacturing titer and yield per batch may adversely impact our ability to meet market demand for any approved product. Furthermore, if we are not able to produce supply at low enough costs, it would negatively impact our ability to generate revenue, harm our reputation, and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIn addition, we currently rely on a strategic collaborator and foreign CDMOs, including a CDMO in China, which we, in part, rely on for the clinical development, manufacturing, and commercialization of our proprietary antibodies developed for SARS-CoV-2, and will likely continue to rely on foreign CDMOs in the future. Foreign CDMOs may be subject to trade restrictions and other foreign regulatory requirements which could increase the cost or reduce the supply of material available to us, delay the procurement of such material or have an adverse effect on our ability to secure significant commitments from governments to purchase our potential therapies.\nAdditionally, the biopharmaceutical industry in particular in China is strictly regulated by the Chinese government. Changes to Chinese regulations or government policies affecting biopharmaceutical companies are unpredictable and may have a material adverse effect on our collaborators in China which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Evolving changes in China\u2019s public health, economic, political, and social conditions and the uncertainty around China\u2019s relationship with other governments, such as the United States and the U.K., could also negatively impact our ability to manufacture our product candidates for our planned clinical trials or have an adverse effect on our ability to secure government funding, which could adversely affect our financial condition and cause us to delay our clinical development programs.\nFurther, our reliance on third-party suppliers and manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be exposed to if we manufactured product candidates ourselves, including:\n\u2022delay or inability to procure or expand sufficient manufacturing capacity;\n\u2022delays in process development;\n\u2022issues related to scale-up of manufacturing;\n\u2022excess manufacturing capacity due to insufficient market demand for our product candidates and responsibility for the associated costs;\n\u2022costs and validation of new equipment and facilities required for scale-up;\n\u2022inability of our third-party manufacturers to execute technology transfers, manufacturing procedures and other logistical support requirements appropriately or on a timely basis;\n\u2022inability to negotiate manufacturing agreements with third parties under commercially reasonable terms, if at all;\n\u2022breach, termination or nonrenewal of manufacturing agreements with third parties in a manner or at a time that is costly or damaging to us;\n\u2022reliance on single sources for product raw materials or components;\n\u2022lack of qualified backup suppliers for those raw materials or components that are currently purchased from a sole or single-source supplier;\n\u2022lack of ownership to the intellectual property rights to any improvements made by our third-party manufacturers in the manufacturing process for our product candidates;\n\u2022disruptions to operations of our third-party manufacturers or suppliers by conditions unrelated to our business or operations, including the bankruptcy of the manufacturer or supplier;\n\u2022disruptions caused by geopolitical events, including civil or political unrest (such as the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia), terrorism, insurrection or war, man-made or natural disasters or public health pandemics or epidemics, including, for example, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u2022carrier disruptions or increased costs that are beyond our control.\nWe cannot be sure that single source suppliers for our product raw materials or components will remain in business or that they will not be purchased by one of our competitors or another company that is not interested in continuing to produce these raw materials or components for our intended purpose. In addition, the lead time needed to establish a relationship with a new supplier can be lengthy and we may experience delays in meeting demand in the event we must switch to a new supplier. The time and effort to qualify a new supplier could result in additional costs, diversion of resources or reduced manufacturing yields, any of which would negatively impact our operating results.\nFurthermore, there are a limited number of suppliers and manufacturers that supply synthetic siRNAs. Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Alnylam, is currently supplying clinical material for our VIR-2218 Phase 1/2 clinical trial through its CDMOs. We will assume responsibility for technology transfer and manufacturing ahead of any Phase 3 clinical trials for VIR-2218. Alnylam currently relies on a limited number of suppliers and CDMOs for our supply of synthetic siRNAs. There are risks inherent in pharmaceutical manufacturing that could affect the ability of Alnylam and Alnylam\u2019s CDMOs to meet our delivery time requirements or provide adequate amounts of synthetic siRNAs to meet our needs. Included in these risks are potential delays or raw materials and component shortages including as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, synthesis and purification failures and/or contamination during the manufacturing process, as well as other issues with the CDMO\u2019s facility and ability to comply with the applicable manufacturing requirements, including use of the proper raw materials and components, which could result in unusable product. This would cause delays in our manufacturing timelines and ultimately delay our clinical trials and potentially put at risk commercial supply, as well as result in additional expense to us. To fulfill our siRNA requirements, we may need to secure alternative suppliers of synthetic siRNAs and/or key raw materials and components, and such alternative suppliers are limited and may not be readily available, or we may be unable to enter into agreements with them on reasonable terms and in a timely manner.\nIn addition, manufacturers may have little or no experience with viral vector products and therefore may require a significant amount of support from us in order to implement and maintain the infrastructure and processes required to manufacture our HCMV vector-based product candidates. The challenges to HCMV-based vaccine manufacturing include the large size of the virus, which precludes terminal sterile filtration, and the attenuation of the engineered human virus, which dramatically reduces high growth yields during manufacturing. To address these challenges, we have made significant internal investments in process development and scale-up, largely funded by grants from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. We have established a cGMP process in support of Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials that has been successfully transferred and executed at CDMOs specializing in live vaccine manufacturing. However, the existing process will require additional process development and scale-up for later stages of clinical development and commercial supply.\nAny of these events could lead to clinical trial delays or failure to obtain regulatory approval or impact our ability to successfully commercialize our current or any future product candidates once approved. Some of these events could be the basis for FDA action, including injunction, request for recall, seizure or total or partial suspension of production.\nChanges in U.S. and international trade policies, particularly with respect to China, may adversely impact our business and operating results.\nThe U.S. government has made statements and taken actions in recent years that have led to certain changes and may lead to additional changes to U.S. and international trade policies, including imposing several rounds of tariffs affecting certain products manufactured in China. In March 2018, the Trump administration announced the imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum entering the United States and in June 2018 announced further tariffs targeting goods imported from China. Both China and the United States have each imposed tariffs indicating the potential for further trade barriers. It is unknown whether and to what extent new tariffs (or other new laws or regulations) will be adopted, or the effect that any such actions would have on us or our industry, and it is unclear whether the Biden administration will work to reverse these measures or pursue similar policy initiatives. While we have only recently started commercialization of sotrovimab under EUA, any unfavorable government policies on international trade, such as export controls, capital controls or tariffs, may affect the demand for sotrovimab or our product candidates, the competitive position of sotrovimab or our product candidates, and import or export of raw materials and product used in our drug development activities and commercial manufacturing, particularly with respect to raw materials and product that we import from China, including pursuant to our manufacturing arrangements with WuXi Biologics. If any new tariffs, export controls, legislation and/or regulations are implemented, or if existing trade agreements are renegotiated or, in particular, if the U.S. government takes retaliatory trade actions due to the recent U.S.-China trade tension, such changes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business involves the use of hazardous materials and we and our third-party manufacturers and suppliers must comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, which can be expensive and restrict how we do, or interrupt our, business.\nOur research and development activities and our third-party manufacturers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 activities involve the generation, storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials, including the components of our product candidates and other hazardous compounds and wastes. We and our manufacturers and suppliers are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations governing, among other matters, the use, manufacture, generation, storage, handling, transportation, discharge and disposal of these hazardous materials and wastes and worker health and safety. In some cases, these hazardous materials and various wastes resulting from their use are stored at our and our manufacturers\u2019 facilities pending their use and disposal. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury, which could result in an interruption of our commercialization efforts, research and development efforts and business operations, damages and significant cleanup costs and liabilities under applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. We also cannot guarantee that the safety procedures utilized by our third-party manufacturers for handling and disposing of these materials and wastes generally comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations. We may be held liable for any resulting damages costs or liabilities, which could exceed our resources, and state or federal or other applicable authorities may curtail our use of certain materials and/or interrupt our business operations. Furthermore, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent. We cannot predict the impact of such changes and cannot be certain of our future compliance. Failure to comply with these environmental, health and safety laws and regulations may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions. We do not currently carry hazardous waste insurance coverage.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct, supervise and monitor our preclinical studies and clinical trials, and if those third parties perform in an unsatisfactory manner, it may harm our business.\nWe do not currently have the ability to independently conduct any clinical trials. We intend to rely on CROs and clinical trial sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our preclinical studies and clinical trials, and we expect to have limited influence over their actual performance. We rely on CROs to monitor and manage data for our clinical programs, as well as the execution of future preclinical studies. We expect to control only certain aspects of our CROs\u2019 activities. Nevertheless, we will be responsible for ensuring that each of our preclinical studies and clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities.\nWe and our CROs are required to comply with the good laboratory practices, or GLPs, and GCPs, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities in the form of International Conference on Harmonization guidelines for any of our product candidates that are in preclinical and clinical development. The regulatory authorities enforce GCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and clinical trial sites. Although we rely on CROs to conduct GCP-compliant clinical trials, we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our GLP preclinical studies and clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its investigational plan and protocol and applicable laws and regulations. If we or our CROs fail to comply with GCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable, and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. Accordingly, if our CROs fail to comply with these regulations or fail to recruit a sufficient number of subjects, we may be required to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.\nOur reliance on third parties to conduct clinical trials will result in less direct control over the management of data developed through clinical trials than would be the case if we were relying entirely upon our own staff. Communicating with CROs and other third parties can be challenging, potentially leading to mistakes as well as difficulties in coordinating activities. If our CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations, fail to meet expected deadlines or fail to comply with regulatory requirements, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for any other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize, any product candidate that we develop. As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for any product candidate that we develop would be harmed, our costs could increase, and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed. While we will have agreements governing their activities, our CROs will not be our employees and we will not control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our future clinical and preclinical programs. These CROs may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical trials or other product development activities which could harm our business. We face the risk of potential\nunauthorized disclosure or misappropriation of our intellectual property by CROs, which may reduce our trade secret protection and allow our potential competitors to access and exploit our proprietary technology.\nIf our relationship with any of these CROs terminates, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or do so on commercially reasonable terms. Switching or adding additional CROs involves substantial cost and requires management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work. As a result, delays occur, which can negatively impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines. While we intend to carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIn addition, principal investigators for our clinical trials may serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us from time to time and receive compensation in connection with such services. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to report some of these relationships to the FDA. The FDA may conclude that a financial relationship between us and a principal investigator has created a conflict of interest or otherwise affected interpretation of the trial. The FDA may therefore question the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site and the utility of the clinical trial itself may be jeopardized. This could result in a delay in approval or rejection of our marketing applications by the FDA and may ultimately lead to the denial of marketing approval of our product candidates.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we breach our license agreements or any of the other agreements under which we acquired, or will acquire, the intellectual property rights to our product candidates, we could lose the ability to continue the development and commercialization of the related product candidates.\nWe license a number of technologies to form our antibody platform and T cell platform, and the technology we use in our siRNA platform is licensed from Alnylam. We have also developed certain product candidates using intellectual property licensed from third parties. A core element of our business strategy includes continuing to acquire or in-license additional technologies or product candidates for the treatment and prevention of serious infectious diseases.\nIf we fail to meet our obligations under these agreements, our licensors may have the right to terminate our licenses. If any of our license agreements are terminated, and we lose our intellectual property rights under such agreements, this may result in a complete termination of our product development and any commercialization efforts for the product candidates which we are developing under such agreements. While we would expect to exercise all rights and remedies available to us, including seeking to cure any breach by us, and otherwise seek to preserve our rights under such agreements, we may not be able to do so in a timely manner, at an acceptable cost or at all. We may also be subject to risks related to disputes between us and our licensors regarding the intellectual property subject to a license agreement.\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our product candidates and technology, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad or robust, our competitors could develop and commercialize products and technology similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and technology may be adversely affected.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our product candidates and our technology. We and our licensors have sought, and intend to seek, to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our product candidates and our technology that are important to our business.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has, in recent years, been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or product candidates or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and product candidates. Because patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing, and some remain so until issued, we cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to file a patent application relating to any particular aspect of a product candidate. Furthermore, if third parties have filed such patent applications with a priority date before March 16, 2013, an interference proceeding in the United States can be initiated by such third party, or by the U.S. Patent and\nTrademark Office, or USPTO, itself, to determine who was the first to invent any of the subject matter covered by the patent claims of our applications.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive, time-consuming and complex, and we may not be able to file, prosecute, maintain, enforce or license all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. In addition, changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of patent applications and the enforcement or defense of issued patents. Similarly, changes in patent law and regulations in other countries or jurisdictions, changes in the governmental bodies that enforce them or changes in how the relevant governmental authority enforces patent laws or regulations may weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce patents that we own or have licensed or that we may obtain in the future.\nWe or our licensors have not pursued or maintained, and may not pursue or maintain in the future, patent protection for our product candidates in every country or territory in which we may sell our products, if approved. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing our patents in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products that infringe our patents in and into the United States or other jurisdictions.\nMoreover, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued and its scope can be reinterpreted after issuance. Even if the patent applications we license or own do issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors or other third parties from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors or other third parties may be able to circumvent our patents by developing similar or alternative products in a non-infringing manner.\nThe issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and product candidates. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our intellectual property may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by the patents and patent applications we hold with respect to our product candidates is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to develop, and threaten our ability to commercialize, our product candidates, or could result in licensees seeking release from their license agreements.\nFurthermore, our owned and in-licensed patents may be subject to a reservation of rights by one or more third parties. For example, the research resulting in certain of our owned and in-licensed patent rights and technology was funded in part by the U.S. government. As a result, the government may have certain rights, or march-in rights, to such patent rights and technology. When new technologies are developed with government funding, the government generally obtains certain rights in any resulting patents, including a nonexclusive license authorizing the government to use the invention for noncommercial purposes. These rights may permit the government to disclose our confidential information to third parties and to exercise march-in rights to use or allow third parties to use our licensed technology. The government can exercise its march-in rights if it determines that action is necessary because we fail to achieve practical application of the government-funded technology, because action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs, to meet requirements of federal regulations, or to give preference to U.S. industry. In addition, our rights in such inventions may be subject to certain requirements to manufacture products embodying such inventions in the United States. Any exercise by the government of such rights could harm our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent rights depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by government patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for noncompliance with these requirements.\nThe USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. In addition, periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other government fees on patents and/or patent applications will\nhave to be paid to the USPTO and various government patent agencies outside the United States over the lifetime of our owned and licensed patents and/or applications and any patent rights we may own or license in the future. We rely on our service providers or our licensors to pay these fees. The USPTO and various non-U.S. government patent agencies require compliance with several procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. We employ reputable law firms and other professionals to help us comply, and we are also dependent on our licensors to take the necessary action to comply with these requirements with respect to our licensed intellectual property. Noncompliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include, but are not limited to, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, nonpayment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. If we or our licensors fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering our product candidates or technologies, including as a result of geopolitical events such as civil or political unrest (including the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia), we may not be able to use such patents and patent applications or stop a competitor from marketing products that are the same as or similar to our product candidates, which would have an adverse effect on our business. In many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. There are situations, however, in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, potential competitors might be able to enter the market and this circumstance could harm our business.\nIn addition, if we fail to apply for applicable patent term extensions or adjustments, we will have a more limited time during which we can enforce our granted patent rights. In addition, if we are responsible for patent prosecution and maintenance of patent rights in-licensed to us or out-licensed by us, any of the foregoing could expose us to liability to the applicable patent owner or licensee, respectively.\nPatent terms may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our product candidates or any products approved in the future for an adequate amount of time and additional competitors could enter the market with generic or biosimilar versions of such products.\nPatents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years after its first effective filing date. Although various extensions may be available, the life of a patent and the protection it affords is limited. In addition, although upon issuance in the United States a patent\u2019s life can be increased based on certain delays caused by the USPTO, this increase can be reduced or eliminated based on certain delays caused by the patent applicant during patent prosecution. If we do not have sufficient patent life to protect our products, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nGiven the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of our product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. We expect to seek extensions of patent terms in the United States and, if available, in other countries where we have or will obtain patent rights. In the United States, the Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the normal expiration of the patent, provided that the patent is not enforceable for more than 14 years from the date of drug approval, which is limited to the approved indication (or any additional indications approved during the period of extension). Furthermore, only one patent per approved product can be extended and only those claims covering the approved product, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. However, the applicable authorities, including the FDA and the USPTO in the United States, and any equivalent regulatory authority in other countries, may not agree with our assessment of whether such extensions are available, and may refuse to grant extensions to our patents, or may grant more limited extensions than we request. If this occurs, our competitors may be able to take advantage of our investment in development and clinical trials by referencing our clinical and preclinical data and launch their product earlier than might otherwise be the case.\nAlso, there are detailed rules and requirements regarding the patents that may be submitted to the FDA for listing in the FDA publication, \u201cApproved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,\u201d known as the Orange Book. We may be unable to obtain patents covering our product candidates that contain one or more claims that satisfy the requirements for listing in the Orange Book. Even if we submit a patent for listing in the Orange Book, the FDA may decline to list the patent, or a manufacturer of generic drugs may challenge the listing. If one of our product candidates is approved and a patent covering that product candidate is not listed in the Orange Book, a manufacturer of generic drugs would not have to provide advance notice to us of any ANDA filed with the FDA to obtain permission to sell a generic version of such product candidate. We cannot predict which, if any, patents in our current portfolio or patents we may obtain in the future will be eligible for listing in the Orange Book, how any generic competitor would address such patents, whether we would sue on any such patents or the outcome of any such suit. For additional information regarding the Hatch-Waxman Act and exclusivity, see the section titled \u201cBusiness-Government Regulation and Product Approval.\u201d\nWe may not be successful in securing or maintaining proprietary patent protection for products and technologies we develop or license. Moreover, if any of our owned or in-licensed patents are successfully challenged by litigation, the affected product could immediately face competition and its sales would likely decline rapidly. Any of the foregoing could harm our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a negative impact on the success of our business.\nOur commercial success depends, in part, upon our ability and the ability of others with whom we may collaborate to develop, manufacture, market and sell our current and any future product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the proprietary rights and intellectual property of third parties. The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive and complex litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are developing our EUA product and other product candidates. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our EUA product and other product candidates may give rise to claims of infringement of the patent rights of others. We may in the future become party to, or be threatened with, adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our current and any future product candidates and technology, including interference proceedings, derivation proceedings, post grant review and inter-partes review before the USPTO. If we are found to infringe a third party\u2019s valid and enforceable intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing, manufacturing and marketing our product candidate(s) and technology. Under any such license, we would most likely be required to pay various types of fees, milestones, royalties or other amounts. Moreover, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all, and if such an instance arises, our ability to commercialize our product candidates may be impaired or delayed, which could in turn significantly harm our business. Parties making claims against us may also seek and obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize our EUA product or other product candidates.\nThe licensing or acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights is a competitive area, and more established companies may also pursue strategies to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights that we may consider attractive or necessary. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, capital resources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities. In addition, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us. We also may be unable to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate return on our investment or at all. If we are unable to successfully obtain rights to required third-party intellectual property rights or maintain the existing intellectual property rights we have, we may have to abandon development of the relevant program or product candidate, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Furthermore, even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be nonexclusive, thereby giving our competitors and other third parties access to the same technologies licensed to us, and it could require us to make substantial licensing and royalty payments. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease developing, manufacturing and commercializing the infringing technology or product candidate. We may also have to redesign our products, which may not be commercially or technically feasible or require substantial time and expense. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent or other intellectual property right. We may be required to indemnify collaborators or contractors against such claims. A finding of infringement could prevent us from manufacturing and commercializing our EUA product or current or any future product candidates or force us to cease some or all of our business operations, which could harm our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation can be expensive and time-consuming and would divert management\u2019s attention from our core business. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nClaims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may be subject to claims asserting that our employees, consultants or advisors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their current or former employers or claims asserting ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nCertain of our employees, consultants or advisors are currently, or were previously, employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees, consultants and advisors do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that these individuals or we have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such individual\u2019s current or former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIn addition, we may in the future be subject to claims by our former employees or consultants asserting an ownership right in our patents or patent applications as a result of the work they performed on our behalf. For example, we may have inventorship disputes arise from conflicting obligations of consultants or others who are involved in developing our product candidates. Although it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the conception or development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who, in fact, conceives or develops intellectual property that we regard as our own, and we cannot be certain that our agreements with such parties will be upheld in the face of a potential challenge or that they will not be breached, for which we may not have an adequate remedy. The assignment of intellectual property rights may not be self-executing or the assignment agreements may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims that they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, the patents of our licensors or our other intellectual property rights, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate our patents, the patents of our licensors or our other intellectual property rights. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file legal claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming and are likely to divert significant resources from our core business, including distracting our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities.\nIn addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours or our licensors is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our owned or licensed patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our owned or licensed patent applications at risk of not issuing. The initiation of a claim against a third party might also cause the third party to bring counterclaims against us, such as claims asserting that our patent rights are invalid or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness, non-enablement or lack of statutory subject matter. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant material information from the USPTO, or made a materially misleading statement, during prosecution. Third parties may also raise similar validity claims before the USPTO in post-grant proceedings such as ex parte reexaminations, inter-partes review, post-grant review, or oppositions or similar proceedings outside the United States, in parallel with litigation or even outside the context of litigation. Third parties may also challenge inventorship through a derivation proceeding or other litigation proceeding challenging inventorship, which can include claims of misappropriation of intellectual property, filing a patent application without authorization of the true inventor, not listing inventors, or listing non-inventors as inventors. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. We cannot be certain that there is or will be no invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. For the patents and patent applications that we have licensed, we may have limited or no right to participate in the defense of any licensed patents against challenge by a third party. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of any future patent protection on our current or future product candidates. Such a loss of patent protection could harm our business.\nWe may not be able to prevent, alone or with our licensors, misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States. Our business could be harmed if in litigation the prevailing party does not offer us a license, or if the license offered as a result is not on commercially reasonable terms. Any litigation or other proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nWe may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources and more mature and developed intellectual property portfolios. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating or from successfully challenging our intellectual property rights. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have an adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world, which could negatively impact our business.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents covering our current and any future product candidates and technology platforms in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we or our licensors have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we may obtain patent protection but where patent enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued or licensed patents, and any future patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from so competing.\nIssued patents may be challenged by third parties in the courts or patent offices in various countries throughout the world. Invalidation proceedings may result in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable. Uncertainties regarding the outcome of such proceedings, as well as any resulting losses of patent protection, could harm our business.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our intellectual property and proprietary rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing, and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property and proprietary rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nMany countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. Some countries do not enforce patents related to medical treatments, or limit enforceability in the case of a public emergency. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of such patent. If we or any of our licensors is forced to grant a license to third parties with respect to any patents relevant to our business, our competitive position may be impaired, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected.\nIf the U.S. government, the World Trade Organization, or WTO, or other governmental body imposes an intellectual property rights waiver, our ability to successfully commercialize our COVID-19 product candidates and protect our related technology could be adversely affected.\nThe WTO is currently considering a waiver of intellectual property rights for COVID-19 vaccines and the U.S. government recently took a stance in support of the waiver. The current proposal is for a temporary waiver of intellectual property rights that cover COVID-19 vaccines, however, the ultimate timing and scope of the waiver, if approved, is unknown. The scope and timing of such waiver will likely be subject to extensive negotiations given the complexity of the matter, which may result in prolonged uncertainty, which could adversely affect our business. If a waiver is approved and\ncovers COVID-19 treatments or prophylactics, such as sotrovimab and VIR-7832, our ability to successfully commercialize our COVID-19 product candidates and protect our related technology could be adversely affected.\nThe current waiver proposal is the result of public health concerns from the COVID-19 pandemic and an effort to make vaccines more widely available worldwide. This proposal may also lead to similar waivers of intellectual property rights in the future in connection with other public health pandemics or epidemics or other situations of public health concern. Given that our business is focused on treating and preventing infectious diseases, there is a risk that our business and our ability to protect our technology could be adversely affected in situations beyond COVID-19.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patent and trademark protection for our product candidates, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. Because we rely on third parties to help us discover, develop and manufacture our current and any future product candidates, or if we collaborate with third parties for the development, manufacturing or commercialization of our current or any future product candidates, we must, at times, share trade secrets with them. We may also conduct joint research and development programs that may require us to share trade secrets under the terms of our research and development collaborations or similar agreements.\nWe seek to protect our proprietary technology in part by entering into confidentiality agreements and, if applicable, material transfer agreements, consulting agreements or other similar agreements with our advisors, employees, third-party contractors and consultants prior to beginning research or disclosing proprietary information. These agreements typically limit the rights of these parties to use or disclose our confidential information, including our trade secrets. We also enter into invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees, advisors and consultants. Despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets, the need to share trade secrets and other confidential information increases the risk that such trade secrets become known by our competitors, are inadvertently incorporated into the technology of others or are disclosed or used in violation of these agreements. Moreover, we cannot guarantee that we have entered into such agreements with each party that may have or have had access to our confidential information or proprietary technology and processes. Monitoring unauthorized uses and disclosures is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary technologies will be effective. If any of the collaborators, scientific advisors, employees, contractors and consultants who are parties to these agreements breaches or violates the terms of any of these agreements, we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach or violation, and we could lose our trade secrets as a result. Moreover, if confidential information that is licensed or disclosed to us by our partners, collaborators or others is inadvertently disclosed or subject to a breach or violation, we may be exposed to liability to the owner of that confidential information. Enforcing a claim that a third-party illegally or unlawfully obtained and is using our trade secrets, like patent litigation, is expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets.\nIn addition, our competitors may independently develop knowledge, methods and know-how equivalent to our trade secrets. Competitors could purchase our products and replicate some or all of the competitive advantages we derive from our development efforts for technologies on which we do not have patent protection. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us. Given that our proprietary position is based, in part, on our know-how and trade secrets, a competitor\u2019s discovery of our trade secrets or other unauthorized use or disclosure could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and other confidential information by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. Additionally, the risk of cyber-attacks or other privacy or data security incidents may be heightened as a result of our moving increasingly towards a remote working environment, which may be less secure and more susceptible to hacking attacks. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and detecting the disclosure or misappropriation of confidential information and enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated confidential information is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. Further, we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our confidential information may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors, in which case we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us.\nAny trademarks we may obtain may be infringed or successfully challenged, resulting in harm to our business.\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on trademarks as one means to distinguish any of our products and product candidates that are approved for marketing from the products of our competitors. Additionally, the process of obtaining trademark protection is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable trademark applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner or obtain trademark protection in all jurisdictions that we consider to be important to our business. Once we select trademarks and apply to register them, our trademark applications may not be approved. Third parties may oppose our trademark applications or otherwise challenge our use of the trademarks. In the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our products, which could result in loss of brand recognition and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands. Our competitors may infringe our trademarks, and we may not have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks.\nIn addition, any proprietary product name we propose to use with our current or any other product candidate in the United States must be approved by the FDA, regardless of whether we have registered it, or applied to register it, as a trademark. The FDA typically conducts a review of proposed product names, including an evaluation of the potential for confusion with other product names. If the FDA objects to any of our proposed proprietary product names, we may be required to expend significant additional resources in an effort to identify a suitable proprietary product name that would qualify under applicable trademark laws, not infringe the existing rights of third parties and be acceptable to the FDA.\nThe exercise by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation of its licenses to certain of our intellectual property and its development and commercialization of products that we are also developing and commercializing could have an adverse impact on our market position.\nWe entered into an amended and restated letter agreement with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, or the Gates Agreement, in January 2022, which amends and restates the letter agreement with the Billi & Melinda Gates Foundation that we entered into in December 2016. In connection with the Gates Agreement, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation purchased $20.0 million of shares of our convertible preferred stock and purchased $40.0 million of shares of our common stock. We are obligated to use the proceeds of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation\u2019s investment in furtherance of its charitable purposes to perform certain activities set forth in the Gates Agreement. For additional information regarding our obligations under the Gates Agreement, see the section titled \u201cBusiness-Our Collaboration, License and Grant Agreements-Amended and Restated Letter Agreement with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.\u201d\nIf we fail to comply with (i) our obligations to use the proceeds of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation\u2019s investment for the purposes described in the paragraph above and to not use such proceeds for specified prohibited uses, (ii) specified reporting requirements or (iii) specified applicable laws, or if we materially breach our specified global access commitments (any such failure or material breach, a specified default), we will be obligated to redeem or arrange for a third party to purchase all of our stock purchased by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation under the Gates Agreement, at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation\u2019s request, at a price equal to the greater of (1) the original purchase price or (2) the fair market value, which amount may increase in the event of a sale of our company or all of our material assets relating to the Gates Agreement. Additionally, if a specified default occurs or if we are unable or unwilling to continue the HIV program, tuberculosis program, vaccinal antibody program or, if applicable, the mutually agreed additional program (except for scientific or technical reasons), or if we institute bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, then the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation will have the right to exercise a non-exclusive, fully-paid license (with the right to sublicense) under our intellectual property to the extent necessary to use, make and sell products arising from such programs, in each case solely to the extent necessary to benefit people in the developing countries in furtherance of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation\u2019s charitable purpose.\nThe exercise by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation of any of its non-exclusive licenses to certain of our intellectual property (or its right to obtain such licenses), and its development and commercialization of product candidates and products that we are also developing and commercializing, could have an adverse impact on our market position.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations, Employee Matters and Managing Growth\nWe are highly dependent on our key personnel, and if we are not able to retain these members of our management team or recruit and retain additional management, clinical and scientific personnel, our business will be harmed.\nWe are highly dependent on our management, scientific and medical personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Scangos. Our key personnel may currently terminate their employment with us at any time. The loss of the services of any of these persons could impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives.\nAdditionally, we do not currently maintain \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance on the lives of our executives or any of our employees.\nRecruiting and retaining other senior executives, qualified scientific and clinical personnel and, if we progress the development of any of our product candidates, commercialization, manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel, will be critical to our success. The loss of the services of our executive officers or other key employees could impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives and seriously harm our ability to successfully implement our business strategy. Furthermore, replacing executive officers and key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to successfully develop, gain regulatory approval of and commercialize our product candidates. Competition to hire from this limited pool is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, retain or motivate these key personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel. We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high-quality personnel, our ability to pursue our growth strategy will be limited.\nOur future performance will also depend, in part, on our ability to successfully integrate newly hired executive officers into our management team and our ability to develop an effective working relationship among senior management. Our failure to integrate these individuals and create effective working relationships among them and other members of management could result in inefficiencies in the development and commercialization of our product candidates, harming future regulatory approvals, sales of our product candidates and our results of operations.\nWe have in the past and may in the future acquire or invest in other companies or technologies, which could divert our management\u2019s attention, result in dilution to our stockholders and otherwise disrupt our operations and adversely affect our operating results.\nWe have in the past and may in the future seek to acquire or invest in additional businesses and/or technologies that we believe complement or expand our product candidates, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities in the United States and internationally. The pursuit of potential acquisitions and investments may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying, investigating and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are consummated. In addition, we are exposed to market risks related to our investments, including changes in fair value of equity securities we hold, which is discussed in greater detail under Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nFor example, we acquired TomegaVax, Inc., or TomegaVax, in September 2016, Humabs BioMed SA, or Humabs, in August 2017, Agenovir Corporation, or Agenovir, in January 2018 and Statera Health, LLC, or Statera, in February 2018. Realizing the benefits of these acquisitions will depend upon the successful integration of the acquired technology into our existing and future product candidates. Furthermore, we may not be able to integrate the acquired personnel, operations and technologies successfully, or effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition. We also may not realize the anticipated benefits from any acquired business. We face many risks in connection with acquisitions and investments, whether or not consummated. A significant portion of the purchase price of companies we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill and other intangible assets, which must be assessed for impairment at least annually. If our acquisitions do not yield expected returns, we may in the future be required to take charges to our operating results based on this impairment assessment process, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIn addition, in connection with our acquisitions of TomegaVax, Humabs and Agenovir, we are required to make future contingent payments upon the achievement of certain milestones. We may in the future be required to make these payments, which could adversely affect our financial condition. For additional information regarding our obligations under these agreements, see the section titled \u201cBusiness-Our Acquisition Agreements\u201d.\nFurthermore, acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, if an acquired business fails to meet our expectations, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may suffer. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in integrating the businesses or technologies we may acquire. The failure to successfully integrate these businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe have experienced significant growth in our organization in recent years and expect to continue to expand, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had 444 full-time employees, an increase of 117 employees compared to December 31, 2020. We have experienced significant growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations in recent years, particularly in the areas of research, development and regulatory affairs, and we expect to continue to experience growth as the clinical development of our product candidates progresses. In addition, if any of our product candidates receives marketing approval, we will need to build out our sales and marketing capabilities, either on our own or with others. To manage our anticipated future growth, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems, expand our facilities, and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel all within the context of the rapidly evolving global pandemic of COVID-19. We continue to closely monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and will evolve our expansion plans as needed. As a result of the global pandemic, the majority of our workforce has been working from home since March 2020. Despite this, we must continue to effectively integrate, develop and motivate a growing number of new employees, and maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture. We have implemented plans to reopen our offices to allow employees to return when appropriate. Although these plans are consistent with local government requirements, and focused on employee safety, and contemplate returning to remote work should the COVID-19 situation change, there is uncertainty regarding the long-term impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the nature of the office environment and remote working, which could present operational and workplace culture challenges as we seek to expand our organization. The expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert our management and business development resources. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations, recruit and train additional qualified personnel, or succeed at effectively integrating employees that have joined during the global pandemic. Any inability to manage growth could delay the execution of our business plans or disrupt our operations.\nBusiness disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nOur operations, and those of our CDMOs, CROs and other contractors and consultants, could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, water shortages, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, public health pandemics or epidemics (including, for example, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic), geopolitical events, including civil or political unrest (such as the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia), terrorism, insurrection or war, and other natural or man-made disasters or business interruptions, for which we are predominantly self-insured. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm our operations and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nOur ability to develop our product candidates could be disrupted if our operations or those of our suppliers are affected by geopolitical events, man-made or natural disasters or other business interruptions. Our corporate headquarters are located in California near major earthquake faults and fire zones. The ultimate impact on us, our significant suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and fire zones and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown, but our operations and financial condition could suffer in the event of a major earthquake, fire or other natural disaster.\nOur business could be materially adversely affected by the effects of health pandemics or epidemics, including the current outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic and future outbreaks of the disease.\nOur business could be materially adversely affected by the effects of health pandemics or epidemics, including the current COVID-19 pandemic, the multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants that have further complicated the fight to subdue the global pandemic and any future outbreaks of the disease. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in travel restrictions, quarantines orders and other restrictions by governments to reduce the spread of the disease. As a result, the majority of our workforce has been working from home since March 2020.\nThe effects of the restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic and our work-from-home policies, including the evolving nature of such policies, may negatively impact productivity, disrupt our business and delay our clinical programs and timelines, the magnitude of which will depend, in part, on the length and severity of the restrictions and other limitations on our ability to conduct our business in the ordinary course. In addition, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and our remote workforce, we have experienced an increased risk to our information technology assets and data. We have implemented plans to reopen our offices when appropriate. We may face several challenges or disruptions upon a return back to the workplace, including re-integration challenges by our employees and distractions to management related to such transition. These and\nsimilar, and perhaps more severe, disruptions in our operations could negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nQuarantines, shelter-in-place and similar government orders, or the perception that such orders or other restrictions on the conduct of business operations could occur, related to COVID-19 or other infectious diseases could impact personnel at third-party manufacturing facilities in the United States and other countries, or the availability or cost of materials, which would disrupt our supply chain. In particular, some of our CDMOs that we use to supply our early-stage product candidates are located in China, where the COVID-19 outbreak was first reported and where there have been government-imposed quarantines. While many of these materials may be obtained by more than one supplier, including suppliers outside of China, port closures and other restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak in the region or other regions may disrupt our supply chain or limit our ability to obtain sufficient materials for our product candidates.\nIn addition, our clinical trials have been affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Site initiation and patient enrollment has been and may be further delayed due to prioritization of hospital resources toward the COVID-19 pandemic, and some patients may not be able or willing to comply with clinical trial protocols if quarantines impede patient movement or interrupt healthcare services. Similarly, our ability to recruit and retain patients and principal investigators and site staff who, as healthcare providers, may have heightened exposure to COVID-19, has been delayed or disrupted, which has adversely impacted our clinical trial operations.\nThe continued spread of COVID-19, which has caused a broad impact globally, may materially affect us economically. While the potential economic impact brought by, and the duration of, the COVID-19 pandemic, may be difficult to assess or predict, it has already resulted in significant disruption of global financial markets. This disruption, if sustained or recurrent, could make it more difficult for us to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity. In addition, a recession or market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially affect our business and the value of our common stock.\nThe global pandemic of COVID-19 and the evolution of new and existing variants of COVID-19 that are resistant to existing treatments or vaccinations continue to rapidly evolve. The ultimate impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or a similar health pandemic or epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, our clinical trials, healthcare systems or the global economy as a whole. These effects could have a material impact on our operations, and we will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely.\nIf our information systems, or those maintained on our behalf, fail or suffer security breaches, such events could result in, without limitation, the following: a significant disruption of our product development programs; an inability to operate our business effectively; unauthorized access to or disclosure of the personal information we process; and other adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur computer and information technology systems, cloud-based computing services and those of our current and any future collaborators, service providers and other parties upon whom we rely are potentially vulnerable to malware, computer viruses, denial-of-service attacks (such as credential stuffing), ransomware attacks, user error or malfeasance, data corruption, cyber-based attacks, natural disasters, public health pandemics or epidemics (including, for example, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic), terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures that may result in damage to or the interruption or impairment of key business processes, or the loss or corruption of our information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information. We may also experience server malfunction, software or hardware failures, supply-chain cyber-attacks, loss of data or other computer assets and other similar issues. We have recently experienced security breaches of our information technology systems, such as through business email compromises. The techniques used to sabotage or to obtain unauthorized access to information systems, and networks in which cyber threat actors store data or through which they transmit data change frequently and we may be unable to implement adequate preventative measures. Any significant system failure, accident or security breach could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operations.\nWe may be required to expend significant resources (including financial), fundamentally change our business activities and practices, or modify our operations, including our clinical trial activities, or information technology in an effort to protect against security breaches and to mitigate, detect, and remediate actual and potential vulnerabilities. Relevant laws, regulations, industry standards and contractual obligations, may require us to implement specific security measures or use industry-standard or reasonable measures to protect against security breaches. The costs to us to mitigate network security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and while we have implemented security measures to protect our data security and information technology systems, our efforts to address\nthese problems may not be successful, and these problems could result in unexpected interruptions, data loss or corruption, delays, cessation of service and other harm to our business and our competitive position. If the information technology systems of our third-party vendors become subject to disruptions or security breaches, we may have insufficient recourse against such third parties and we may have to expend significant resources to mitigate the impact of such an event, and to develop and implement protections to prevent future events of this nature from occurring. Although we maintain cybersecurity insurance coverage, such insurance may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. Furthermore, if a security breach were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a disruption of our development programs and our business operations, whether due to a loss of our trade secrets or other proprietary information or other similar disruptions.\nFor example, we, our third-party vendors, and our partners' third-party vendors have experienced social engineering efforts (including phishing attacks) designed to gain unauthorized access to our systems and information, including recent business email and system compromises. Similarly, we and our partners' third-party vendors may be a target of other phishing attacks, social engineering attacks and other cyber-attacks in the future. If a data security breach affects our or third parties\u2019 systems upon which we rely, corrupts our data or results in the unauthorized disclosure or release of personally identifiable information, our reputation could be materially damaged or our operations disrupted. In addition, such a breach may require notification to governmental agencies, supervisory bodies, credit reporting agencies, the media, individuals, collaborators or others pursuant to various federal, state and foreign data protection, privacy and security laws, regulations and guidelines, industry standards, our policies and our contracts, if applicable. Such laws may include HIPAA and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH. Under these laws specifically, notice of certain security breaches must be made to affected individuals, the Secretary of the Department of HHS, and, for extensive breaches, to the media or state attorneys general. Such a notice could further harm our reputation and our ability to compete. Such disclosures are costly, and the disclosure or the failure to comply with such requirements could lead to a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, or financial condition. Furthermore, a data security breach could result in fines, increased costs or loss of revenue and we could incur liability (such as through regulatory fines and penalties as well as private claims), our competitive position could be harmed and the further development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed. Additionally, federal, state and foreign laws and regulations can expose us to enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities, and potentially result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability, if our information technology security efforts fail.\nWe receive, process, store and use personal information and other data, which subjects us to governmental regulation and other legal obligations, liability and risks related to privacy, security, and data protection, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could lead to government enforcement actions (that could include fines and penalties), a disruption of our clinical trials or commercialization of our products, private litigation, harm to our reputation, or other adverse effects on our business or prospects.\nWe receive, process, store and use personal information and other data about our clinical trial participants, employees, collaborators and others. We are, or may become, subject to numerous domestic and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, and data security, industry standards, as well as policies, contracts and other obligations that apply to the processing of personal information by us and on our behalf, the scope of which is changing, subject to differing applications and interpretations and may be inconsistent among countries, or conflict with other rules. We strive to comply with all applicable data protection requirements and obligations; however new laws, policies, codes of conduct and legal obligations may arise, continue to evolve, be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and conflict with one another. Any failure or perceived failure by us or third parties working on our behalf to comply with applicable data protection requirements may result in governmental enforcement actions (including fines, penalties, judgments, settlements, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight, temporary or permanent bans on all or some processing of personal information, orders to destroy or not use personal information, imprisonment of company officials and public censure), civil claims, litigation, damage to our reputation and loss of goodwill, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial performance, interrupt or stop clinical trials, limit our ability to develop or commercialize our products, or require us to revise or restructure our operations. With substantial uncertainty over the interpretation and application of these laws, regulations and other obligations, we may face challenges in addressing their requirements and making necessary changes to our policies and practices, and may incur significant costs and expenses in our efforts to do so. For additional information regarding these laws, see the section titled \u201cBusiness-Government Regulation and Product Approval-Privacy Laws.\u201d\nOur employees, principal investigators, consultants and commercial partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our employees, principal investigators, consultants and commercial partners. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional failures, reckless and/or negligent conduct or unauthorized activities that violates (i) the laws and regulations of FDA and other regulatory authorities, including those laws requiring the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to such authorities, (ii) manufacturing standards, (iii) federal and state data privacy, security, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad, (iii) laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data and (iv) insider trading laws that restrict the buying and selling of shares of our common stock while in possession of material non-public information. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Such misconduct also could involve the improper use of individually identifiable information, including, without limitation, information obtained in the course of clinical trials, creating fraudulent data in our preclinical studies or clinical trials or illegal misappropriation of drug product, which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation. In addition, during the course of our operations, our directors, executives and employees may have access to material non-public information regarding our business, our results of operations or potential transactions we are considering. We may not be able to prevent a director, executive or employee from violating our insider trading policies and buying or selling, or \u201ctipping\u201d others who might buy or sell, shares of our common stock on the basis of, or while having access to, material non-public information. If a director, executive or employee was to be investigated, or an enforcement action was to be brought against a director, executive or employee for insider trading, it could have a negative impact on our reputation and our stock price\nIt is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from government investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. Additionally, we are subject to the risk that a person or government could allege such fraud or other misconduct, even if none occurred. If any such actions are instituted against us and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could result in significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participating in government-funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of noncompliance with these laws, contractual damages, reputational harm and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur ability to use our net operating losses, or NOLs, to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nAlthough we recorded net income for the year ended December 31, 2021, we have otherwise incurred accumulated net losses since inception and have no assurances that we will continue to be profitable in the near future. As of December 31, 2021, we had net operating loss carryforwards of $24.2 million for federal tax purposes and $126.6 million for state tax purposes. If not utilized, federal carryforwards will begin expiring in 2035 and state carryforwards will begin expiring in 2031. Our ability to use our federal and state net operating losses to offset potential future taxable income is dependent upon our generation of future taxable income before any expiration dates of the net operating losses, and we cannot predict with certainty when, or whether, we will generate sufficient taxable income to use all of our net operating losses.\nIn general, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d (generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point change (by value) in its equity ownership by certain stockholders over a rolling three-year period) is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOLs to offset future taxable income. We may have experienced ownership changes in the past or as a result of the IPO and may experience ownership changes as a result of future offerings and/or subsequent changes in our stock ownership (some of which shifts are outside our control). In addition, Agenovir has experienced at least one ownership change in the past resulting in a limitation under Section 382 of the Code, which has been accounted for in calculating our available NOL carryforwards. As a result, if, and to the extent that we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change NOLs to offset such taxable income may be subject to limitations.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and the CARES Act include, among other things, changes to U.S. federal tax rates and the rules governing NOL carryforwards. For example, NOLs arising in tax years ending after December 31, 2017 can be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such federal NOLs may be limited to 80% of current year taxable income for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2021. Deferred tax assets for NOLs will need to be measured at the applicable\ntax rate in effect when the NOL is expected to be utilized. The changes in the carryforward periods, as well as the new limitation on use of NOLs may impact our ability to utilize our NOLs to offset taxable income in the future.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur financial condition and results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year, which makes them difficult to predict.\nWe expect our financial condition and results of operations to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, you should not rely upon the results of any quarterly or annual periods as indications of future operating performance. In addition, we are exposed to market risks related to our investments, including changes in fair value of equity securities we hold which may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year, which is discussed in greater detail under Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and in the future, may be, volatile and fluctuate substantially, which could result in substantial losses for purchasers of our common stock.\nOur stock price has been, and in the future, may be, subject to substantial volatility. From October 11, 2019, our first day of trading on The Nasdaq Global Select Market, or Nasdaq, through February 22, 2022, the closing price of our stock ranged from $11.83 per share to $83.07 per share. As a result of the volatility in our stock price, our stockholders could incur substantial losses.\nThe stock market in general and the market for biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies in particular, has experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, for example, has negatively affected some sectors of the stock market and investor sentiment and has resulted in significant volatility. As a result of this volatility, you may not be able to sell your common stock at or above the price you paid for your shares. Market and industry factors may cause the market price and demand for our common stock to fluctuate substantially, regardless of our actual operating performance, which may limit or prevent investors from selling their shares at or above the price paid for the shares and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock.\nIn addition, public statements by us, government agencies, our competitors, the media or others relating to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (including regarding our and others\u2019 efforts to develop COVID-19 therapies) and the impact of such statements on investors\u2019 general perception of our company and our business have in the past resulted, and may in the future result, in significant fluctuations in our stock price. Given the global focus on the COVID-19 pandemic, information in the public arena on this topic, whether or not accurate, has had and will likely continue to have an outsized impact (positive or negative) on our stock price. Moreover, sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by our stockholders in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur, have in the past, and may in the future depress the market price of our common stock. Information related to our development, manufacturing, regulatory and commercialization efforts with respect to sotrovimab and VIR-7832, or information regarding such efforts by competitors with respect to their potential therapies, may meaningfully impact our stock price.\nSome companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their shares have been the subject of securities class action litigation. Any lawsuit to which we are a party, with or without merit, may result in an unfavorable judgment. We also may decide to settle lawsuits on unfavorable terms. Any such negative outcome could result in payments of substantial damages or fines, damage to our reputation or adverse changes to our business practices. Defending against litigation is costly and time-consuming and could divert our management\u2019s attention and our resources. Furthermore, during the course of litigation, there could be negative public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments, which could have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock.\nConcentration of ownership of our common stock among our existing executive officers, directors and principal stockholders may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions.\nOur executive officers, directors and stockholders who own more than 5% of our outstanding common stock beneficially own a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock. If these persons acted together, they may be able to significantly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors and approval of any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. The concentration of voting power and\ntransfer restrictions could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company on terms that other stockholders may desire or result in the management of our company in ways with which other stockholders disagree.\nIf research analysts do not publish research or reports, or publish unfavorable research or reports, about us, our business or our market, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. If any of the analysts who cover us issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding us, our business model, our intellectual property or our stock performance, or if the clinical trials and operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts, our stock could decline. If analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain.\nYou should not rely on an investment in our common stock to provide dividend income. We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. In addition, the terms of any future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain in the foreseeable future.\nWe have incurred and we will continue incur significant increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company, we have incurred and we will continue to incur significant legal, accounting, investor relations and other expenses. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and rules subsequently implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and Nasdaq have imposed various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Further, in July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was enacted, pursuant to which the SEC adopted rules and regulations related to corporate governance and executive compensation, such as \u201csay on pay\u201d and proxy access. Emerging growth companies are permitted to implement many of these requirements over time, however, we are no longer an emerging growth company as of December 31, 2020, and expect to incur additional compliance-related expenses as a result.\nStockholder activism, the current political environment and the current high level of U.S. government intervention and regulatory reform may also lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may in turn lead to additional compliance costs and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we do not currently anticipate. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to comply with these requirements. Moreover, these requirements will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, we expect that these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance. We cannot predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs we may incur to respond to these requirements.\nAs a public company, we may also be subject to more stringent state law requirements, such as California Senator Bill 826, which generally requires public companies with principal executive offices in California to have a minimum number of females on the company\u2019s board of directors, and California Assembly Bill 979, which generally requires public companies with principal executive offices in California to include specified numbers of directors from \u201cunderrepresented communities.\u201d We are currently compliant with the requirements, but there are no assurances that we will be compliant in the future. If we fail to comply with either Senator Bill 826 or Assembly Bill 979, we could be fined by the California Secretary of State, with a $100,000 fine for the first violation and a $300,000 for each subsequent violation, and our reputation may be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting and the trading price of our common stock may decline.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404, we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting, including an attestation report on internal control over financial\nreporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. We were previously not required to include an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting while we were an emerging growth company. However, we are no longer an emerging growth company as of December 31, 2020. The rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation. To comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the requirements of being a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and any complex accounting rules in the future, we may need to upgrade our information technology systems; implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures; and hire additional accounting and finance staff. We are currently in the process of hiring additional accounting and finance staff as we grow our business. If we are unable to hire the additional accounting and finance staff necessary to comply with these requirements, we may need to retain additional outside consultants. If we or, if required, our auditors, are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting and the trading price of our common stock may decline.\nWe cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. Our previous acquisitions and strategic transactions and resulting international operations have increased the complexity of our accounting, and additional acquisitions and transactions and further geographic expansion will likely increase this complexity and the related accounting challenges. Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm determines that we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.\nOur reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, or the SEC, and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, may retroactively affect previously reported results, could cause unexpected financial reporting fluctuations and may require us to make costly changes to our operational processes and accounting systems.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our corporate charter and our bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of us that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares. These provisions also could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. For a summary of these provisions, see the section titled \u201cAnti-Takeover Provisions of Delaware Law and Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws-Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws\u201d in Exhibit 4.3 Description of Capital Stock filed as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if and only if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware lacks subject matter jurisdiction, any state court located within the State of Delaware or, if and only if all such state courts lack subject matter jurisdiction, the federal district court for the\nDistrict of Delaware) will be the exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law:\n\u2022any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\n\u2022 any action or proceeding asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders;\n\u2022any action or proceeding asserting a claim against us or any of our current or former directors, officers or other employees, arising out of or pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws;\n\u2022any action or proceeding to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws; and\n\u2022any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors, officers or other employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nThis provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the U.S. federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such Securities Act actions. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. To prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different courts, among other considerations, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation further provides that the federal district courts of the United States will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum. While the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than those designated in the exclusive forum provisions. In such instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the validity and enforceability of the exclusive forum provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. This may require significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that the provisions will be enforced by a court in those other jurisdictions.\nThese exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage these types of lawsuits. Furthermore, the enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies\u2019 certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that a court could find these types of provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable. If a court were to find the exclusive-forum provision contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur further significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, all of which could harm our business.", "PERMNO": 19032, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "VIR"}
