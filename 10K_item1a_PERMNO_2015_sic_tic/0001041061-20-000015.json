Any of the following risk factors, either by itself or together with other risk factors, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and/or financial condition.\nFood safety and food-borne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our business.\nFood-borne illnesses, such as E. coli, Listeria, Salmonella and Trichinosis, occur or may occur within our system from time to time. In addition, food safety issues such as food tampering, contamination and adulteration occur or may occur within our system from time to time. Any report or publicity linking us or one of our Concepts\u2019 restaurants, including restaurants operated by us or our Concepts\u2019 franchisees, or linking our competitors or the retail food industry generally, to instances of food-borne illness or food safety issues could adversely affect our Concepts\u2019 brands and reputations as well as our revenues and profits, and possibly lead to product liability claims, litigation, governmental investigations or actions, and damages. If a customer of one of our Concepts\u2019 restaurants becomes ill from food borne illnesses or as a result of food safety issues, restaurants in our system may be temporarily closed, which could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, instances or allegations of food-borne illness or food safety issues, real or perceived, involving our restaurants, restaurants of competitors, or our suppliers or distributors (regardless of whether we use or have used those suppliers or distributors), or otherwise involving the types of food served at our restaurants, could result in negative publicity that could adversely affect either our or our Concepts\u2019 franchisees\u2019 revenues and profits. The occurrence of food-borne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients, which could result in disruptions in our supply chain and/or lower margins for us and our Concepts\u2019 franchisees.\nHealth concerns arising from the outbreak of a health epidemic or pandemic, including the coronavirus, may have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur business could be materially and adversely affected by the outbreak of a widespread health epidemic or pandemic, including arising from various strains of avian flu or swine flu, such as H1N1, or the coronavirus, particularly if located in regions from which we derive a significant amount of revenue or profit. The occurrence of such an outbreak or other adverse public health developments could materially disrupt our business and operations. Such events could also significantly impact our industry and cause a temporary closure of restaurants, which could severely disrupt our or our franchisees' operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn late 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was first detected in Wuhan, China. Following the outbreak of this virus, the Chinese government has quarantined certain affected regions and certain travel restrictions have been imposed. We have a significant number of KFC and Pizza Hut Concept restaurants located in mainland China, operated by our master franchisee, Yum China. Many of our restaurants located within mainland China have been temporarily closed, have shortened operating hours and/or have otherwise been adversely affected by the impact of the coronavirus, and these developments have also impacted the ability of Yum\nChina's suppliers to provide food and other needed supplies at our Concepts\u2019 restaurants in mainland China. Additionally, other nearby franchisees, such as those in Hong Kong and Taiwan, have experienced significant sales declines as well. We are unable to accurately predict the impact that the coronavirus will have on our results of operations, due to uncertainties including the ultimate geographic spread of the virus within and outside of China, the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, and actions that may be taken by governmental authorities to contain the coronavirus or to treat its impact. However, while it is premature to accurately predict the ultimate impact of these developments, we expect our results for the quarter ending March 31, 2020 to be significantly impacted with potential continuing, adverse impacts beyond March 31, 2020.\nIn addition, our operations could be disrupted if any of our employees or employees of our business partners were suspected of having the avian flu or swine flu, or other illnesses such as hepatitis A, norovirus or coronavirus, since this could require us or our business partners to quarantine some or all of such employees or disinfect our restaurant facilities. Outbreaks of avian flu occur from time to time around the world, and such outbreaks have resulted in confirmed human cases. It is possible that outbreaks could reach pandemic levels. Public concern over avian flu generally may cause fear about the consumption of chicken, eggs and other products derived from poultry, which could cause customers to consume less poultry and related products. Because poultry is a menu offering for our Concepts, this would likely result in lower revenues and profits for us and our Concepts\u2019 franchisees. Avian flu outbreaks could also adversely affect the price and availability of poultry, which could negatively impact profit margins and revenues for us and our Concepts' franchisees.\nFurthermore, other viruses may be transmitted through human contact, and the risk of contracting viruses could cause employees or guests to avoid gathering in public places, which could adversely affect restaurant guest traffic or the ability to adequately staff restaurants. We could also be adversely affected if government authorities impose mandatory closures, seek voluntary closures, impose restrictions on operations of restaurants, or restrict the import or export of products, or if suppliers issue mass recalls of products. Even if such measures are not implemented and a virus or other disease does not spread significantly, the perceived risk of infection or health risk may adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur operating results and growth strategies are closely and increasingly tied to the success of our Concepts\u2019 franchisees.\nThe vast majority (98%) of our restaurants are operated by our Concepts\u2019 franchisees, and our percentage of franchise-owned restaurants has increased in recent years. Our refranchising efforts have increased our dependence on the financial success and cooperation of our Concepts\u2019 franchisees. In addition, our long-term system sales growth targets depend on maintaining the pace of our net system unit growth rate. Nearly all of this unit growth is expected to result from new unit openings by our Concepts\u2019 franchisees. We increasingly also rely on master franchisees, who have rights to license to sub-franchisees the right to develop and operate restaurants, to achieve our expectations for new unit development. If our Concepts\u2019 franchisees and master franchisees do not meet our expectations for new unit development, we may fall short of our system sales targets. In addition, we have franchise relationships that are particularly important to our business, such as our relationship with Yum China as described in a subsequent risk factor below, our strategic alliance with Telepizza Group S.A., who is the master franchisee of Pizza Hut in Latin America (excluding Brazil) and portions of Europe, and our relationship with certain large franchisees, such as NPC International, Inc. the largest operator of Pizza Hut restaurants in the United States. Any failure to realize the expected benefits of such franchise relationships may adversely impact our business and operating results.\nWe have limited control over how our Concepts\u2019 franchisees\u2019 businesses are run, and their inability to operate successfully could adversely affect our operating results through decreased fees paid to us for royalties, advertising funds contributions, and other discrete services we may provide to our Concept\u2019s franchisees (e.g. management of e-commerce platform). If our Concepts\u2019 franchisees fail to adequately capitalize their businesses or incur too much debt, if their operating expenses or commodity prices increase or if economic or sales trends deteriorate such that they are unable to operate profitably or repay existing debt, it could result in their financial distress, including insolvency or bankruptcy, or the inability to meet development targets or obligations. If a significant franchisee of one of our Concepts becomes, or a significant number of our Concepts\u2019 franchisees in the aggregate become, financially distressed, our operating results could be impacted through reduced or delayed fee payments that cause us to record bad debt expense, reduced advertising fund contributions, and reduced new unit development. In addition, we are secondarily liable on certain of our Concepts\u2019 franchisees\u2019 restaurant lease agreements, including lease agreements that we have guaranteed or assigned to franchisees in connection with the refranchising of certain Company-owned restaurants. Our operating results could be impacted by any increased rent obligations for such leased properties to the extent our Concepts\u2019 franchisees default on such lease agreements. In addition, the failure of our Concepts\u2019 franchisees to adequately engage in succession planning may adversely affect their restaurant operations and the development of new restaurants, which in turn could hurt our business.\nOur success also depends on the willingness and ability of our Concepts\u2019 franchisees to implement marketing programs and major initiatives such as restaurant remodels or equipment or technology upgrades, which may require financial investment. Our Concepts may be unable to successfully implement strategies that we believe are necessary for further growth if their franchisees do not participate, which in turn may harm the growth prospects and financial condition of the Company. Additionally, the failure of our\nConcepts\u2019 franchisees to focus on key elements of restaurant operations, such as quality, service and cleanliness (even if such failures do not rise to the level of breaching the related franchise documents) may be attributed by guests to our Concepts\u2019 entire brand and could have a negative impact on our business.\nOur reliance on master franchise arrangements can decrease our level of control over our Concepts' restaurants and increase certain risks arising from franchise operations. For example, we rely on our master franchisees to monitor and enforce sub-franchisee compliance with our operating standards, and a failure to comply with such standards could adversely affect our business.\nWe may not achieve our target development goals, aggressive development could cannibalize existing sales and new restaurants may not be profitable.\nOur growth strategy depends on our and our Concepts\u2019 franchisees\u2019 ability to increase the number of restaurants around the world. The successful development of new units depends in large part on the ability of our Concepts\u2019 franchisees to open new restaurants and to operate these restaurants profitably. Effectively managing growth can be challenging, particularly as we expand into new markets internationally, and we cannot guarantee that we, or our Concepts\u2019 franchisees, including Yum China, will be able to achieve our expansion goals or that new restaurants will be operated profitably. Further, there is no assurance that any new restaurant will produce operating results similar to those of our existing restaurants. Other risks that could impact our ability to increase the number of our restaurants include prevailing economic conditions and trade or economic policies or sanctions, our ability to attract new franchisees, construction and development costs of new restaurants, and our, or our Concepts\u2019 franchisees\u2019, ability to obtain suitable restaurant locations, negotiate acceptable lease or purchase terms for the locations, obtain required permits and approvals in a timely manner, hire and train qualified management teams and restaurant crews, and meet construction schedules.\nExpansion into markets could also be affected by our Concepts\u2019 franchisees\u2019 willingness to invest capital or ability to obtain financing to construct and open new restaurants. If it becomes more difficult or more expensive for our Concepts\u2019 franchisees to obtain financing to develop new restaurants, or if the perceived return on invested capital is not sufficiently attractive, the expected growth of our system could slow and our future revenues and operating cash flows could be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, the development of new restaurants could impact the sales of our Concepts\u2019 existing restaurants nearby. There can be no assurance that sales cannibalization will not occur or become more significant in the future as we increase our presence in existing markets.\nWe have significant exposure to the Chinese market through our largest franchisee, Yum China, which subjects us to risks that could negatively affect our business.\nA significant portion of our total business is conducted in mainland China, particularly with respect to our KFC Concept. In connection with the spin-off of our China business in 2016 into an independent publicly-traded company (the \"Separation\" or \u201cYum China spin-off\u201d), we entered into a Master License Agreement with Yum China pursuant to which Yum China is the exclusive licensee of the KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell Concepts and their related marks and other intellectual property rights for restaurant services in mainland China. Following the Separation, Yum China became, and continues to be, our largest franchisee. Our financial results are significantly affected by Yum China\u2019s results as we are entitled to receive a 3% sales-based royalty on all Yum China system sales related to our Concepts. Yum China's business is exposed to risks in mainland China, which include, among others, potential political, financial or social instability, changes in economic conditions (including consumer spending, unemployment levels and wage and commodity inflation), consumer preferences, the regulatory environment (including uncertainties with respect to the interpretation and enforcement of Chinese laws, rules and regulations), and tax laws and regulations including the tax treatment of the royalty paid to YUM, as well as increased media scrutiny of our Concepts and industry, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, increased restrictions or tariffs on imported supplies as a result of trade disputes, any epidemics or pandemics arising out of mainland China, and increased competition. Further, any significant or prolonged deterioration in U.S.-China relations could adversely affect our Concepts in mainland China if Chinese consumers reduce the frequency of their visits to Yum China\u2019s restaurants. Chinese law regulates Yum China's business conducted within mainland China. Our royalty income from the Yum China business is therefore subject to numerous uncertainties based on the policies of the Chinese government, as they may change from time to time. If Yum China\u2019s business is harmed or development of our Concepts\u2019 restaurants is slowed in mainland China due to any of these factors, it could negatively impact the royalty paid by Yum China to us, which would negatively impact our financial results or our growth prospects.\nOur relationship with Yum China is governed primarily by a Master License Agreement, which may be terminated upon the occurrence of certain events, such as the insolvency or bankruptcy of Yum China. In addition, if we are unable to enforce our intellectual property or contract rights in mainland China, if Yum China is unable or unwilling to satisfy its obligations under the Master License Agreement, or if the Master License Agreement is otherwise terminated, it could result in an interruption in the\noperation of our brands that have been exclusively licensed to Yum China for use in mainland China. Such interruption could cause a delay in, or loss of, royalty income to us, which would negatively impact our financial results.\nOur international operations subject us to risks that could negatively affect our business.\nA significant portion of our Concepts\u2019 restaurants are operated in countries and territories outside of the U.S., including in emerging markets, and we intend to continue expansion of our international operations. As a result, our business and the businesses of our Concepts\u2019 franchisees are increasingly exposed to risks inherent in international operations. These risks, which can vary substantially by country, include political, financial or social instability or conditions, corruption, anti-American sentiment and social and ethnic unrest, as well as changes in economic conditions (including consumer spending, unemployment levels and wage and commodity inflation), the regulatory environment (including the risks of operating in developing or emerging markets in which there are significant uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of legal requirements and the enforceability of contract rights and intellectual property rights), income and non-income based tax rates and laws, the impact of import restrictions or controls, sanctions, foreign exchange control regimes including restrictions on currency conversion, natural disasters, the impact of labor costs and conditions, consumer preferences and the laws and policies that govern foreign investment in countries where our Concepts' restaurants are operated. For example, we have been subject to a regulatory enforcement action in India alleging violation of foreign exchange laws for failure to satisfy conditions of certain operating approvals, such as minimum investment and store build requirements as well as limitations on the remittance of fees outside of the country (See Note 19). In addition, we and our franchisees do business in jurisdictions that may be subject to trade or economic sanction regimes and such sanctions could be expanded. Any failure to comply with such sanction regimes or other similar laws or regulations could result in the assessment of damages, the imposition of penalties, suspension of business licenses, or a cessation of operations at our or our franchisees\u2019 businesses, as well as damage to our and our Concepts\u2019 brands\u2019 images and reputations, all of which could harm our profitability.\nForeign currency risks and foreign exchange controls could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur results of operations and the value of our foreign assets are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which may adversely affect reported earnings. More specifically, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, such as the Chinese Renminbi (\u201cRMB\u201d), Australian Dollar, the British Pound and the Euro, as well as currencies in certain other markets, such as the Malaysian Ringgit and Russian Ruble, could have an adverse effect on our reported earnings. There can be no assurance as to the future effect of any such changes on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In addition, the governments in certain countries where we operate, including China, restrict the conversion of local currency into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of the country. Yum China\u2019s income is almost exclusively derived from the earnings of its Chinese subsidiaries, with substantially all revenues of its Chinese subsidiaries denominated in RMB. Any significant fluctuation in the value of the RMB could materially impact the U.S. dollar value of royalty payments made to us by Yum China, which could result in lower revenues. In addition, restrictions on the conversion of RMB to U.S. dollars or further restrictions on the remittance of currency out of China could result in delays in the remittance of Yum China\u2019s royalty, which could impact our liquidity.\nFailure to protect the integrity and security of personal information of our customers and employees could result in substantial costs, expose us to litigation and damage our reputation.\nWe receive and maintain certain personal, financial and other information about our customers, employees, vendors and franchisees. In addition, our vendors and/or franchisees receive and maintain certain personal, financial and other information about our employees and customers. The use and handling of this information is regulated by evolving and increasingly demanding laws and regulations in various jurisdictions, as well as by certain third-party contracts. We have experienced cyber- attacks and security breaches from time to time. If our security and information systems are compromised as a result of data corruption or loss, cyber-attack or a network security incident or if our employees, franchisees or vendors fail to comply with these laws and regulations and this information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately, it could result in liabilities and penalties and could damage our reputation, cause us to incur substantial costs and result in a loss of customer confidence, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, we could be subject to litigation and government enforcement actions as a result of any such failure.\nFurther, data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations, which sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries where we, our Concepts and our Concepts\u2019 franchisees do business. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"), which was adopted by the European Union effective May 2018, requires companies to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data. In addition, the State of California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (the \u201cCCPA\u201d), which became effective January 2020 and requires companies that process information on California residents to, among other things, provide new disclosures and options to consumers about data collection, use and sharing practices.\nMoreover, each of the GDPR and the CCPA confer a private right-of-action on certain individuals and associations. Our failure to adhere to or successfully implement appropriate processes to adhere to the requirements of GDPR, CCPA and other evolving laws and regulations in this area could result in financial penalties, legal liability and could damage our and our Concepts\u2019 brands\u2019 reputations.\nUnreliable or inefficient restaurant or consumer-facing technology or the failure to successfully implement technology initiatives in the future could adversely impact operating results.\nWe and our Concepts\u2019 franchisees rely heavily on information technology systems in the conduct of our business, some of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third parties, including, for example, point-of-sale processing in our restaurants, management of our supply chain, and various other processes and procedures. These systems are subject to damage, interruption or failure due to theft, fire, power outages, telecommunications failure, computer viruses, security breaches, malicious cyber-attacks or other catastrophic events. Certain technology systems may also be unreliable or inefficient, and technology vendors may limit or terminate product support and maintenance, which could impact the reliability of critical systems operations. If our or our Concepts' franchisees' information technology systems are damaged or fail to function properly, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them, and may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process transactions, which could result in lost sales, customer or employee dissatisfaction, or negative publicity that could negatively impact our reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe and our Concepts\u2019 franchisees rely on technology not only to efficiently operate our restaurants but also to drive the customer experience, sales growth and margin improvement. Execution of our growth strategy will be dependent on our initiatives to implement proprietary and third-party technology solutions and gather and leverage data to enhance restaurant operations and improve the customer experience. We may not be able recruit and retain qualified individuals for these efforts, and there is intense competition for qualified technology systems developers necessary to develop and implement new technologies for our growth initiatives, including increasing our digital relationships with customers. Our strategic technology initiatives may not be implemented in a timely manner or may not achieve the desired results. Even if we effectively implement and manage our technology initiatives, they may not result in sales growth or margin improvement. Additionally, implementing the evolving technology demands of the consumer may place a significant financial burden on us and our Concepts\u2019 franchisees. Moreover, our failure to adequately invest in new technology or adapt to technological developments and industry trends, particularly with respect to digital commerce capabilities, could result in a loss of customers and related market share. If our Concepts\u2019 digital commerce platforms do not meet customers\u2019 expectations in terms of security, speed, attractiveness or ease of use, customers may be less inclined to return to such digital commerce platforms, which could negatively impact our business.\nThere are risks associated with our increasing dependence on digital commerce platforms to maintain and grow sales. Such platforms may experience disruptions, which could harm our ability to compete and conduct our business.\nCustomers are increasingly using e-commerce websites and apps, both domestically and internationally, like pizzahut.com, Pizza Hut, KFC and Taco Bell apps, as well as apps owned by third-party delivery aggregators such as Grubhub and third-party mobile payment processors, to order and pay for our Concepts\u2019 products. As a result, our Concepts and our Concepts\u2019 franchisees are increasingly reliant on digital ordering and payment as a sales channel. These digital ordering and payment platforms could be damaged or interrupted by power loss, technological failures, user errors, cyber-attacks, other forms of sabotage or acts of God. In particular, Pizza Hut relies on digital orders for a significant portion of its sales and could experience and has experienced interruptions of its digital ordering platforms, which limited or delayed customers\u2019 ability to order through such platforms or made customers less inclined to return to such platforms. Any such limitation or delay would negatively impact Pizza Hut\u2019s sales and customer experience and perception.\nYum China, our largest franchisee, utilizes third-party mobile payment apps such as Alipay and WeChat as a means through which to generate sales and process payments. Should customers become unable to access mobile payment apps in China, or should the relationship between Yum China and one or more third-party mobile payment processors become interrupted, our results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nOur inability or failure to recognize, respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could adversely impact our business.\nIn recent years, there has been a marked increase in the use of social media platforms, including blogs, chat platforms, social media websites, and other forms of Internet-based communications which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons. The rising popularity of social media and other consumer-oriented technologies has increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination. Many social media platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants post, often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted. Information posted on such\nplatforms at any time may be adverse to our interests and/or may be inaccurate. The dissemination of information online could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and results of operations, regardless of the information\u2019s accuracy. The damage may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction.\nIn addition, social media is frequently used by our Concepts to communicate with their respective customers and the public in general. Failure by our Concepts to use social media effectively or appropriately, particularly as compared to our Concepts\u2019 respective competitors, could lead to a decline in brand value, customer visits and revenue. Other risks associated with the use of social media include improper disclosure of proprietary information, negative comments about our Concepts\u2019 brands, exposure of personally identifiable information, fraud, hoaxes or malicious dissemination of false information. The inappropriate use of social media by our customers or employees could increase our costs, lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations.\nShortages or interruptions in the availability and delivery of food and other supplies may increase costs or reduce revenues.\nThe products sold by our Concepts and their franchisees are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers although certain products have limited suppliers, which increases our reliance on those suppliers. We, along with our Concepts\u2019 franchisees, are also dependent upon third parties to make frequent deliveries of food products and supplies that meet our specifications at competitive prices. Shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other supplies to our Concepts\u2019 restaurants have happened from time to time and could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of items we use and the operations of our restaurants. Future shortages or disruptions could be caused by inclement weather, natural disasters, inaccurate forecasting of customer demand, problems in production or distribution, restrictions on imports or exports including due to trade disputes, the inability of vendors to obtain credit, political instability in the countries in which the suppliers and distributors are located, the financial instability of suppliers and distributors, suppliers\u2019 or distributors\u2019 failure to meet our standards or requirements, transitioning to new suppliers or distributors, product quality issues, inflation, other factors relating to the suppliers and distributors and the countries in which they are located, food safety warnings or advisories or the prospect of such pronouncements, product recalls, the cancellation of supply or distribution agreements or an inability to renew such arrangements or to find replacements on commercially reasonable terms, or other conditions beyond our control or the control of our Concepts\u2019 franchisees.\nMoreover, the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union which occurred effective as of January 31, 2020, to be followed by a transition period which is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2020 (unless otherwise extended) in which the United Kingdom and the European Union will negotiate the terms of this withdrawal, may give to rise to economic, financial, legal, tax and trade uncertainties that may adversely impact us and could, depending on the terms negotiated during the transition period, result in the reimposition of customs and border controls, which in turn may result in shortages or interruptions in supply to our Concepts in the United Kingdom with consequences similar to those described above.\nIn addition, in the U.S., the Company, along with representatives of the Company\u2019s KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell franchisee groups, are members of Restaurant Supply Chain Solutions, LLC (\u201cRSCS\"), which is a third-party responsible for purchasing certain restaurant products and equipment, and McLane Foodservice, Inc. (\"McLane\") serves as the largest distributor for each of the Company\u2019s Concepts in the U.S. Any failure or inability of our significant suppliers or distributors, including RSCS or McLane to perform could result in shortages or interruptions in the availability of food and other supplies.\nA shortage or interruption in the availability of certain food products or supplies could increase costs and limit the availability of products critical to restaurant operations, which in turn could lead to restaurant closures and/or a decrease in sales. In addition, failure by a key supplier or distributor for our Concepts and/or our Concepts\u2019 franchisees to meet its service requirements could lead to a disruption of service or supply until a new supplier or distributor is engaged, and any disruption could have an adverse effect on our business.\nThe loss of key personnel, or labor shortages or difficulty finding qualified employees could slow our growth, harm our business and reduce our profitability.\nMuch of our future success depends on the continued availability and service of senior management personnel. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key senior management personnel could harm our business.\nIn addition, our restaurant operations are highly service-oriented and our success depends in part upon our and our Concepts\u2019 franchisees\u2019 ability to attract, retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified employees, including franchisee management, restaurant managers and other crew members. The market for qualified employees in the retail food industry is very competitive. Any future inability to recruit and retain qualified individuals may delay our planned use, development or deployment of technology or the planned openings of new restaurants by us and our Concepts\u2019 franchisees which could have a material adverse impact on the operation of our Concepts\u2019 existing restaurants.\nIn addition, strikes, work slowdowns or other job actions may become more common. In the event of a strike, work slowdown or other labor unrest, the ability to adequately staff our Concepts\u2019 restaurants could be impaired, which could result in reduced revenue and customer claims, and may distract our management from focusing on our business and strategic priorities.\nChanges in labor and other operating costs could adversely affect our and our franchisees\u2019 results of operations.\nAn increase in the costs of employee wages, benefits and insurance (including workers\u2019 compensation, general liability, property and health) as well as other operating costs such as rent and energy costs could adversely affect our and our franchisees\u2019 operating results. Such increases could result from general economic or competitive conditions or from government imposition of higher minimum wages at the federal, state or local level. Moreover, there may be a long-term trend toward higher wages in developing markets Any increase in such operating expenses could adversely affect our and our Concepts\u2019 franchisees\u2019 profit margins. In addition, competition for qualified employees could also compel us or our Concepts\u2019 franchisees to pay higher wages to attract or retain key crew members, which could result in higher labor costs and decreased profitability.\nAn increase in food prices may have an adverse impact on our and our Concepts\u2019 franchisees\u2019 profit margins.\nOur and our Concepts\u2019 franchisees\u2019 businesses depend on reliable sources of large quantities of raw materials such as proteins (including poultry, pork, beef and seafood), cheese, oil, flour and vegetables (including potatoes and lettuce). Raw materials purchased for use in our Concepts\u2019 restaurants are subject to price volatility caused by any fluctuation in aggregate supply and demand, or other external conditions, such as weather conditions, or natural events or disasters that affect expected harvests of such raw materials, taxes and tariffs (including as a result of trade disputes), industry demand, food safety concerns, product recalls, governmental regulation and other factors, all of which are beyond our control and in many instances are unpredictable. As a result, the historical prices of raw materials used in the operation of our Concepts\u2019 restaurants have fluctuated. We cannot assure that we or our Concepts\u2019 franchisees will continue to be able to purchase raw materials at reasonable prices, or that the cost of raw materials will remain stable in the future. In addition, a significant increase in gasoline prices could result in the imposition of fuel surcharges by our distributors.\nBecause we and our Concepts\u2019 franchisees provide competitively priced food, we may not have the ability to pass through to our customers the full amount of any commodity price increases. If we and our Concepts\u2019 franchisees are unable to manage the cost of raw materials or to increase the prices of products proportionately, our and our franchisees\u2019 profit margins may be adversely impacted.\nOur Concepts\u2019 brands may be harmed or diluted through franchisee and third-party activity.\nAlthough we monitor and regulate franchisee activities through our Concepts\u2019 franchise agreements, franchisees or other third parties may refer to or make statements about our Concepts\u2019 brands that do not make proper use of our trademarks or required designations, that improperly alter trademarks or branding, or that are critical of our Concepts\u2019 brands or place our Concepts\u2019 brands in a context that may tarnish their reputation. This may result in dilution of, or harm to, our intellectual property or the value of our Concepts\u2019 brands.\nFranchisee noncompliance with the terms and conditions of our franchise agreements may reduce the overall goodwill of our Concepts\u2019 brands, whether through the failure to meet health and safety standards, engage in quality control or maintain product consistency, or through the participation in improper or objectionable business practices. Moreover, unauthorized third parties, including our Concepts\u2019 current and former franchisees, may use our intellectual property to trade on the goodwill of our Concepts\u2019 brands, resulting in consumer confusion or brand dilution. Any reduction of our Concepts\u2019 brands\u2019 goodwill, consumer confusion, or brand dilution is likely to impact sales, and could materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nOur success depends substantially on our corporate reputation and on the value and perception of our brands.\nOur success depends in large part upon our ability and our Concepts\u2019 franchisees\u2019 ability to maintain and enhance the value of our brands and our customers\u2019 loyalty to our brands. Brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective qualities. Those perceptions are affected by a variety of factors, including the nutritional content and preparation of our food, the ingredients we use, and the manner in which we source the commodities we use. Consumer acceptance of our offerings is subject to change for a variety of reasons, and some changes can occur rapidly. For example, nutritional, health and other scientific studies and conclusions, which constantly evolve and may have contradictory implications, drive popular opinion, litigation and regulation (including initiatives intended to drive consumer behavior) in ways that may affect perceptions of our Concepts\u2019 brands generally or relative to available alternatives. In addition, business incidents, whether isolated or recurring, and whether originating from us, our Concepts\u2019 restaurants, franchisees, competitors, governments, suppliers or distributors, can significantly reduce brand value\nand consumer trust, particularly if the incidents receive considerable publicity or result in litigation or investigations. For example, our Concepts\u2019 brands could be damaged by claims or perceptions about the quality or safety of our products or the quality or reputation of our suppliers, distributors or franchisees or that we, our Concepts\u2019 franchisees or other business partners are acting in an unethical, illegal, racially-biased or socially irresponsible manner, regardless of whether such claims or perceptions are true. Similarly, entities in our supply chain may engage in conduct, including alleged human rights abuses or environmental wrongdoing, and any such conduct could damage our or our Concepts\u2019 brands\u2019 reputations. Any such incidents (even if resulting from actions of a competitor or franchisee) could cause a decline directly or indirectly in consumer confidence in, or the perception of, our Concepts\u2019 brands and/or our products and reduce consumer demand for our products, which would likely result in lower revenues and profits. Additionally, our corporate reputation could suffer from a real or perceived failure of corporate governance or misconduct by a Company officer, or an employee or representative of us or a franchisee.\nWe could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us by increasing our expenses, diverting management attention or subjecting us to significant monetary damages and other remedies.\nWe are regularly involved in legal proceedings, which include regulatory claims or disputes, consumer, personal injury, claims from franchisees employment, real estate related, tort, intellectual property, breach of contract, securities, derivative and other litigation. See the discussion of legal proceedings in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits often seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties (some of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control), and unfavorable rulings or developments could occur. Moreover, regardless of whether any such claims have merit, or whether we are ultimately held liable or settle, such litigation may be expensive to defend, may divert resources and management attention away from our operations, and may negatively impact our results of operations. With respect to insured claims, a judgment for monetary damages in excess of any insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Moreover, any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may also adversely affect our Concepts\u2019 reputations, which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn addition, the restaurant industry around the world has been subject to claims that relate to the nutritional content of food products, as well as claims that the menus and practices of restaurant chains have led to customer health issues, including weight gain and other adverse effects. We may also be subject to such claims in the future and, even if we are not, publicity about these matters (particularly directed at the quick service and fast-casual segments of the retail food industry) may harm our Concepts\u2019 reputations and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, these could lead to an increase in the regulation of the content or marketing of our products, including legislation or regulation seeking to tax and/or regulate high-fat foods, foods with high sugar and salt content, or foods otherwise deemed to be \u201cunhealthy,\u201d which could increase costs of compliance and remediation to us and our franchisees.\nChanges in, or noncompliance with, governmental regulations may adversely affect our business operations, growth prospects or financial condition.\nThe Company, and our Concepts and their franchisees, are subject to numerous laws and regulations around the world. These laws change regularly and are increasingly complex. For example, we are subject to:\n\u2022\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act in the U.S. and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in the context of employment, public accommodations and other areas.\n\u2022\nThe U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs matters such as minimum wages, overtime and other working conditions, as well as family leave mandates and a variety of similar state laws that govern these and other employment law matters.\n\u2022\nLaws and regulations in government-mandated health care benefits such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in the U.S.\n\u2022\nLaws and regulations relating to nutritional content, nutritional labeling, product safety, product marketing and menu labeling.\n\u2022\nLaws relating to state and local licensing.\n\u2022\nLaws relating to the relationship between franchisors and franchisees.\n\u2022\nLaws and regulations relating to health, sanitation, food, workplace safety, child labor, including laws regulating the use of certain \u201chazardous equipment\u201d, building and zoning, and fire safety and prevention.\n\u2022\nLaws and regulations relating to union organizing rights and activities.\n\u2022\nLaws relating to information security, privacy (including the European Union's GDPR and California's CCPA), cashless payments, and consumer protection.\n\u2022\nLaws relating to currency conversion or exchange.\n\u2022\nLaws relating to international trade and sanctions.\n\u2022\nTax laws and regulations.\n\u2022\nAnti-bribery and anti-corruption laws.\n\u2022\nEnvironmental laws and regulations.\n\u2022\nFederal and state immigration laws and regulations in the U.S.\nCompliance with new or existing laws and regulations could impact our or our Concepts\u2019 franchisees\u2019 operations. The compliance costs associated with these laws and regulations could be substantial. In addition, if any governmental authority were to adopt and implement a broader standard for determining when two or more otherwise unrelated employers may be found to be a joint employer of the same employees under laws such as the National Labor Relations Act in a manner that is applied generally to franchise relationships (which broader standards in the past have been adopted by U.S. governmental agencies such as the National Labor Relations Board), this could cause us or our Concepts to be liable or held responsible for unfair labor practices and other violations and could subject our Concepts to other liabilities, and/or require our Concepts to conduct collective bargaining negotiations, regarding employees of totally separate, independent employers, most notably our Concepts\u2019 franchisees. Further, a recently-enacted law in California sets out an employment classification test that established a new standard for determining employee or independent contractor status. This law and any similar laws enacted at the federal, state or local level, could increase our and our franchisees\u2019 labor costs and decrease profitability or could cause our franchisees to be deemed employees of our Concepts.\nAny failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could adversely affect our reputation, international expansion efforts, growth prospects and financial results or result in, among other things, litigation, revocation of required licenses, internal investigations, governmental investigations or proceedings, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal liability. Publicity relating to any such noncompliance could also harm our Concepts\u2019 reputations and adversely affect our revenues.\nAdditionally, we are working to manage the risks and costs to us, our franchisees and our supply chain of the effects of climate change, greenhouse gases, and diminishing energy and water resources. These risks include the increased public focus, including by governmental and nongovernmental organizations, on these and other environmental sustainability matters, such as packaging and waste, animal health and welfare, deforestation and land use. These risks also include the increased pressure to make commitments, set targets, or establish additional goals and take actions to meet them. These risks could expose us to market, operational, reputational and execution costs or risks.\nFailure to comply with anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws could adversely affect our business operations.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act and other similar applicable laws prohibiting bribery of government officials and other corrupt practices are the subject of increasing emphasis and enforcement around the world. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, agents or other third parties will not take actions in violation of our policies or applicable law, particularly as we expand our operations in emerging markets and elsewhere. Any such violations or suspected violations could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, including substantial fines and significant investigation costs, and could also materially damage our reputation, brands, international expansion efforts and growth prospects, business and operating results. Publicity relating to any noncompliance or alleged noncompliance could also harm our Concepts\u2019 reputations and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nTax matters, including changes in tax rates or laws, disagreements with taxing authorities, imposition of new taxes and our restructurings could impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property, withholding and franchise taxes in both the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. We are also subject to ongoing and/or regular reviews, examinations and audits by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) and other taxing authorities with respect to such income and non-income based taxes inside and outside of the U.S. Our accruals for tax liabilities are based on past experience, interpretations of applicable law, and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities, but such accruals require significant judgment which may be incorrect and may result in payments greater than the amounts accrued. If the IRS or another taxing authority disagrees with our tax positions, we could face additional tax liabilities, including interest and penalties. Payment of additional amounts upon final settlement or adjudication of any disputes could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.\nIn addition, we are directly and indirectly affected by new tax laws and regulation and the interpretation of tax laws and regulations worldwide. Changes in laws, regulation or interpretation of existing laws and regulations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions where we are subject to taxation could increase our taxes and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Changes in tax laws may arise as a result of tax policy guidance issued by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d), a coalition of member nations including the United States. The OECD guidance, referred to as the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (\u201cBEPS\u201d) Action Plan, does not have the force of law, but certain countries may enact tax legislation,\nmodify tax treaties, and/or increase audit scrutiny based on the BEPS guidance. To the extent BEPS principles are adopted by major jurisdictions in which we operate, it could increase our taxes and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position. We have in the past and may in the future adapt our entity and operating structure in response to and in compliance with changes in tax laws, regulations, or interpretation of existing laws and regulations. Such restructurings could result in material incremental tax costs associated with restructuring transactions or operations of the structure. In addition, public perception that we are not paying a sufficient amount of taxes could damage our Concepts\u2019 reputations, which could harm our profitability.\nThe Yum China spin-off and certain related transactions could result in substantial U.S. tax liability.\nWe received opinions of outside counsel substantially to the effect that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Yum China spin-off and certain related transactions qualified as generally tax-free under Sections 355 and 361 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. The opinions relied on various facts and assumptions, as well as certain representations as to factual matters and undertakings (including with respect to future conduct) made by Yum China and us. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied, we may not be able to rely on these opinions of outside counsel. Accordingly, notwithstanding receipt of the opinions of outside counsel, the conclusions reached in the tax opinions may be challenged by the IRS. Because the opinions are not binding on the IRS or the courts, there can be no assurance that the IRS or the courts will not prevail in any such challenge.\nIf, notwithstanding receipt of any opinion, the IRS were to conclude that the Yum China spin-off was taxable, in general, we would recognize taxable gain as if we had sold the Yum China common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value. In addition, each U.S. holder of our Common Stock who received shares of Yum China common stock in connection with the spin-off transaction would generally be treated as having received a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of Yum China common stock received. That distribution would be taxable to each such U.S. stockholder as a dividend to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. For each such U.S. stockholder, any amount that exceeded our earnings and profits would be treated first as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of such stockholder\u2019s tax basis in our shares of Common Stock with any remaining amount being taxed as a capital gain.\nThe Yum China spin-off may be subject to China indirect transfer tax.\nIn February 2015, the Chinese State Administration of Taxation (\u201cSAT\u201d) issued the Bulletin on Several Issues of Enterprise Income Tax on Income Arising from Indirect Transfers of Property by Non-resident Enterprises (\u201cBulletin 7\u201d). Pursuant to Bulletin 7, an \u201cindirect transfer\u201d of Chinese taxable assets, including equity interests in a China resident enterprise (\u201cChinese interests\u201d), by a non-resident enterprise, may be recharacterized and treated as a direct transfer of Chinese taxable assets, if such arrangement does not have reasonable commercial purpose and the transferor has avoided payment of Chinese enterprise income tax. Using general anti-tax avoidance provisions, the SAT may treat an indirect transfer as a direct transfer of Chinese interests if the transfer has avoided Chinese tax by way of an arrangement without reasonable commercial purpose. As a result, gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to Chinese enterprise income tax, and the transferee or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer would be obligated to withhold the applicable taxes, currently at a rate of up to 10% of the capital gain in the case of an indirect transfer of equity interests in a China resident enterprise.\nWe evaluated the potential applicability of Bulletin 7 in connection with the Separation in the form of a tax free restructuring and believe it is more likely than not that Bulletin 7 does not apply. We believe that the restructuring has reasonable commercial purpose.\nHowever, there are significant uncertainties regarding what constitutes a reasonable commercial purpose, how the safe harbor provisions for group restructurings are to be interpreted and how the Chinese tax authorities will ultimately view the spin-off. As a result, our position could be challenged by the Chinese tax authorities resulting in a tax at a rate of 10% assessed on the difference between the fair market value and the tax basis of Yum China. As our tax basis in Yum China was minimal, the amount of such a tax could be significant and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition.\nFailure to protect our service marks or other intellectual property could harm our business.\nWe regard our Yum\u00ae, KFC\u00ae, Pizza Hut\u00ae, and Taco Bell\u00ae service marks, and other service marks and trademarks related to our restaurant businesses, as having significant value and being important to our marketing efforts. We rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts, copyrights, patents, trademarks, service marks and other common law rights, such as trade secret and unfair competition laws, to protect our restaurants and services from infringement. We have registered certain trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. However, from time to time we become aware of names and marks identical or confusingly similar to our service marks being used by other persons. Although our policy is to oppose any such infringement,\nfurther or unknown unauthorized uses or other misappropriation of our trademarks or service marks could diminish the value of our brands and adversely affect our business. In addition, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our Concepts have, or may in the future open or franchise, a restaurant, and the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. There can be no assurance that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property or the legal protections which may be available will be adequate, and defending or enforcing our service marks and other intellectual property could result in the expenditure of significant resources or result in significant harm to our business, reputation, financial condition, and results of operations. We may also face claims of infringement that could interfere with the use of the proprietary know-how, recipes, or trade secrets used in our business. Defending against such claims may be costly, and we may be prohibited from using such proprietary information in the future or forced to pay damages, royalties, or other fees for using such proprietary information, any of which could negatively affect our business, reputation, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business may be adversely impacted by changes in consumer discretionary spending and general economic conditions.\nOur and our franchisees' results of operations are dependent upon discretionary spending by consumers, which may be affected by general economic conditions globally or in one or more of the markets we serve, and are susceptible to economic slowdowns and recessions. Some of the factors that impact discretionary consumer spending include unemployment and underemployment rates, fluctuations in the level of disposable income, the price of gasoline and other inflationary pressures, stock market performance and changes in the level of consumer confidence. These and other macroeconomic factors could have an adverse effect on our or our franchisees\u2019 sales, profitability or development plans, which could harm our financial condition and operating results.\nThe retail food industry in which we operate is highly competitive.\nOur Concept restaurants compete with international, national and regional restaurant chains as well as locally-owned restaurants, and the retail food industry in which our Concepts operate is highly competitive with respect to price and quality of food products, new product development, digital engagement, advertising levels and promotional initiatives (including the frequent use by our competitors of price discounting, such as through value meal menu options, coupons and other methods), customer service, reputation, restaurant location, and attractiveness and maintenance of properties. In addition, our Concepts compete within the retail food industry for management and hourly personnel, suitable real estate sites, and qualified franchisees. If consumer or dietary preferences change, if our marketing efforts and/or launch of new products are unsuccessful, or if our Concepts\u2019 restaurants are unable to compete successfully with other retail food outlets in new and existing markets, our and our franchisees' businesses could be adversely affected. We also face growing competition as a result of convergence in grocery, convenience, deli and restaurant services, including the offering by the grocery industry of convenient meals, including pizzas and entrees with side dishes. Competition from delivery aggregators and other food delivery services has also increased in recent years, particularly in urbanized areas, and is expected to continue to increase. Increased competition could have an adverse effect on sales, profitability or development plans, which could harm our or our franchisees\u2019 financial condition and operating results.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits from past or potential future acquisitions, investments or other strategic transactions.\nFrom time to time we evaluate and may complete mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, strategic partnerships, minority investments (which may include minority investments in third parties, such as franchisees or master franchisees) and other strategic transactions, including our pending acquisition of The Habit Restaurants, Inc. (in respect of which a definitive agreement was signed in January 2020), our strategic alliance with Telepizza Group S.A. effectuated in December 2018, our acquisition of QuikOrder, LLC completed in December 2018 and our minority investment in Grubhub, Inc. completed in April 2018. While we currently contemplate that the acquisition of The Habit Restaurants, Inc. will be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2020, there is no guarantee that this acquisition will be completed on this time frame or at all.\nPast and potential future strategic transactions may involve various inherent risks, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nexpenses, delays or difficulties in integrating acquired companies, joint venture operations, strategic partnerships or investments into our organization, including the failure to realize expected synergies and/or the inability to retain key personnel;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from other initiatives and/or day-to-day operations to effectively execute our growth strategy;\n\u2022\ninability to generate sufficient revenue, profit, and cash flow from acquired companies, joint ventures, strategic partnerships or investments;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that we have acquired substantial contingent or unanticipated liabilities in connection with acquisitions or other strategic transactions; and\n\u2022\nthe possibility that investments we have made may decline significantly in value.\nPast and potential future strategic transactions may not ultimately create value for us and may harm our reputation and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we account for certain investments, including our investment in Grubhub, on a mark-to-market basis and, as a result, changes in the fair value of these investments impact our reported results. Changes in market prices for equity securities are unpredictable, and our investment in Grubhub has caused, and could continue to cause, significant fluctuations in our results of operations.\nOur substantial indebtedness makes us more sensitive to adverse economic conditions, may limit our ability to plan for or respond to significant changes in our business, and requires a significant amount of cash to service our debt payment obligations that we may be unable to generate or obtain.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our total outstanding short-term borrowings and long-term debt was approximately $10.6 billion. Subject to the limits contained in the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness, we may incur additional debt from time to time, which would increase the risks related to our high level of indebtedness.\nSpecifically, our high level of indebtedness could have important potential consequences, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to plan for and respond to, adverse economic and industry conditions and changes in our business and the competitive environment;\n\u2022\nrequiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of, and interest on, indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends, share repurchases or other corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to a downgrade of our credit rating, which could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity and access to capital markets;\n\u2022\nrestricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a disadvantage compared to other less leveraged competitors or competitors with comparable debt at more favorable interest rates;\n\u2022\nincreasing our exposure to the risk of increased interest rates insofar as current and future borrowings are subject to variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nincreasing our exposure to the risk of discontinuance, replacement or modification of certain reference rates, including LIBOR, which are used to calculate applicable interest rates of our indebtedness and certain derivative instruments that hedge interest rate risk;\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to repay, refinance or satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional funds in the future and increasing the cost of any such borrowing;\n\u2022\nimposing restrictive covenants on our operations as the result of the terms of our indebtedness, which, if not complied with, could result in an event of default, which in turn, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of the applicable debt, and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies; and\n\u2022\nincreasing our exposure to risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency as we earn profits in a variety of currencies around the world and our debt is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars.\nThere is no assurance that we will generate cash flow from operations or that future debt or equity financings will be available to us to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or if future borrowings are not available to us in amounts sufficient to pay our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. As a result, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. There is no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all. Any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 85348, "SIC": 5812, "TIC": "YUM"}
