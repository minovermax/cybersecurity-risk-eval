{"cik": "1104485", "company": "NORTHERN OIL & GAS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOil and natural gas prices are volatile. Extended declines in oil and natural gas prices have adversely affected, and could in the future adversely affect, our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flow.\nThe oil and natural gas markets are very volatile, and we cannot predict future oil and natural gas prices. Oil and natural gas prices declined significantly starting in 2014 and have fluctuated significantly since that time. The prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production heavily influences our revenue, cash flows, profitability, access to capital and future rate of growth. Although we seek to mitigate volatility and potential declines in oil prices through derivative arrangements that hedge a portion of our expected production, this merely seeks to mitigate (not eliminate) these risks, and such activities come with their own risks.\nThe prices we receive for our production and the levels of our production depend on numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022changes in global supply and demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022the actions of OPEC and other major oil producing countries;\n\u2022the price and quantity of imports of foreign oil and natural gas;\n\u2022political and economic conditions, including embargoes, in oil-producing countries or affecting other oil-producing activity;\n\u2022the level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production activity;\n\u2022the level of global oil and natural gas inventories;\n\u2022changes in U.S. energy policy;\n\u2022weather conditions;\n\u2022technological advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u2022domestic and foreign governmental tariffs and/or regulations;\n\u2022proximity and capacity of oil and natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities;\n\u2022the price and availability of competitors\u2019 supplies of oil and natural gas in captive market areas; and\n\u2022the price and availability of alternative fuels.\nThese factors and the volatility of the energy markets make it extremely difficult to predict oil and natural gas prices. Lower oil and natural gas prices have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our revenues, the amount of oil and natural gas that our operators can produce economically, and our reserve bookings. A substantial or extended decline in oil or natural gas prices, such as the depressed commodity price environment that we\u2019ve experienced since late 2014, has resulted in and could result in future impairments of our proved oil and natural gas properties and may materially and adversely affect our future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures. To the extent commodity prices received from production are insufficient to fund planned capital expenditures, we may be required to reduce spending or borrow or issue additional equity to cover any such shortfall. Lower oil and natural gas prices may limit our ability to comply with the covenants under our revolving credit facility (or other debt instruments) and/or limit our ability to access borrowing availability thereunder, which is dependent on many factors including the value of our proved reserves.\nOur estimated reserves are based on many assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\nDetermining the amount of oil and natural gas recoverable from various formations involves significant complexity and uncertainty. No one can measure underground accumulations of oil or natural gas in an exact way. Oil and natural gas reserve engineering requires subjective estimates of underground accumulations of oil and/or natural gas and assumptions\nconcerning future oil and natural gas prices, production levels, and operating, exploration and development costs. Some of our reserve estimates are made without the benefit of a lengthy production history and are less reliable than estimates based on a lengthy production history. As a result, estimated quantities of proved reserves and projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may prove to be inaccurate.\nWe routinely make estimates of oil and natural gas reserves in connection with managing our business and preparing reports to our lenders and investors. We make these reserve estimates using various assumptions, including assumptions as to oil and natural gas prices, development schedules, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. Some of these assumptions are inherently subjective, and the accuracy of our reserve estimates relies in part on the ability of our management team, reserve engineers and other advisors to make accurate assumptions. Any significant variance from these assumptions by actual figures could greatly affect our estimates of reserves, the economically recoverable quantities of oil, natural gas and NGLs attributable to any particular group of properties, the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery, and estimates of the future net cash flows. Numerous changes over time to the assumptions on which our reserve estimates are based, as described above, often result in the actual quantities of oil, natural gas and NGLs we ultimately recover being different from our reserve estimates. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves shown in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, subsequent reports we file with the SEC or other company materials. In addition, we may adjust estimates of net proved reserves to reflect production history, changes in operating costs, results of exploration and development, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and any other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nDrilling for and producing oil, natural gas and NGLs are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur operators\u2019 drilling activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that they will not discover commercially productive reservoirs. Drilling for oil or natural gas can be uneconomical, not only from dry holes, but also from productive wells that do not produce sufficient revenues to be commercially viable. In addition, drilling and producing operations on our acreage may be curtailed, delayed or canceled by our operators as a result of other factors, including:\n\u2022declines in oil or natural gas prices;\n\u2022the high cost, shortages or delivery delays of equipment and services;\n\u2022shortages of or delays in obtaining water for hydraulic fracturing operations;\n\u2022unexpected operational events;\n\u2022adverse weather conditions;\n\u2022facility or equipment malfunctions;\n\u2022title problems;\n\u2022pipeline ruptures or spills;\n\u2022compliance with environmental and other governmental requirements;\n\u2022regulations, restrictions, moratoria and bans on hydraulic fracturing;\n\u2022unusual or unexpected geological formations;\n\u2022loss of drilling fluid circulation;\n\u2022formations with abnormal pressures;\n\u2022environmental hazards, such as oil, natural gas or well fluids spills or releases, pipeline or tank ruptures and discharges of toxic gas;\n\u2022fires;\n\u2022blowouts, craterings and explosions;\n\u2022uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids; and\n\u2022pipeline capacity curtailments.\nAny of these events can cause substantial losses, including personal injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution, environmental contamination, loss of wells and regulatory penalties.\nWe ordinarily maintain insurance against various losses and liabilities arising from our operations; however, insurance against all operational risks is not available to us. Additionally, we may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the perceived risks presented. Losses could therefore occur for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage. The occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse impact on our business activities, financial condition and results of operations.\nDue to the declines in oil and natural gas prices, we have taken significant writedowns of our oil and natural gas properties. We may be required to record further writedowns of our oil and natural gas properties.\nIn 2015 and 2016 we were required to write down the carrying value of certain of our oil and natural gas properties, and further writedowns could be required in the future. Writedowns may occur when oil and natural gas prices are low, or if we have downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves, increases in our estimates of operating or development costs, deterioration in drilling results or mechanical problems with wells where the cost to redrill or repair is not supported by the expected economics.\nUnder the full cost method of accounting, capitalized oil and gas property costs less accumulated depletion and net of deferred income taxes may not exceed an amount equal to the present value, discounted at 10%, of estimated future net revenues from proved oil and gas reserves plus the cost of unproved properties not subject to amortization (without regard to estimates of fair value), or estimated fair value, if lower, of unproved properties that are subject to amortization. Should capitalized costs exceed this ceiling, an impairment would be recognized.\nOur company did not record any impairments during 2017 or 2018, but if a lower pricing environment reoccurs we could be required to further write down the value of our oil and natural gas properties. If lower average monthly pricing is reflected in the trailing twelve-month average pricing calculation, the present value of our future net revenues could decline and one or more impairments could be recognized. The quarterly ceiling test considers many factors including reserves, capital expenditure estimates and trailing twelve-month average prices. SEC defined prices for each quarter in 2018 were as follows:\nAny significant reduction in our borrowing base under our revolving credit facility, and any limit on our ability to comply with the financial covenants thereunder, will negatively impact our liquidity and, consequently, our ability to fund our operations, and we may not have sufficient funds to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility or any other obligation if required as a result of a borrowing base reduction.\nAvailability under our revolving credit facility is subject to a borrowing base, with scheduled semiannual (April 1 and October 1) and other elective borrowing base redeterminations based upon, among other things, projected revenues from, and asset values of, the oil and natural gas properties securing the revolving credit facility. The lenders under the revolving credit facility can unilaterally adjust the borrowing base and the borrowings permitted to be outstanding under our revolving credit facility. Our revolving credit facility includes covenants that require the ratio of (a) our Total Net Debt (as defined therein) to (b) EBITDAX (as defined therein), to not exceed 4.00 to 1.00 and (ii) the ratio of Current Assets (as defined therein) to Current Liabilities (as defined therein) to be greater than or equal to 1.00 to 1.00, in each case, as of the last day of any fiscal quarter. Reductions in estimates of our producing oil, NGL and natural gas reserves could result in a reduction of our borrowing base thereunder. The same could also arise from other factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022lower commodity prices or production;\n\u2022inability to drill or unfavorable drilling results;\n\u2022changes in crude oil, NGL and natural gas reserve engineering; or\n\u2022increased operating and/or capital costs.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $140.0 million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility. We expect to make further borrowings under our revolving credit facility in the future. Any significant reduction in our borrowing base could result in a default under current and/or future debt instruments, negatively impact our liquidity and our ability to fund our operations and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operation and cash flow. Further, if the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility were to exceed the borrowing base as a result of any such redetermination, we could be required to repay the excess. If we do not have sufficient funds and we are otherwise unable to arrange new financing, we may have to sell significant assets. Any such sale could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nOur future success depends on our ability to replace reserves that our operators produce.\nBecause the rate of production from oil and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted, our future success depends upon our ability to economically find or acquire and produce additional oil and natural gas reserves. Except to the extent that we acquire additional properties containing proved reserves, conduct successful exploration and development activities or, through engineering studies, identify additional behind-pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves, our proved reserves will decline as our reserves are produced. We have added significant net wells and production from wellbore-only acquisitions, where we don\u2019t hold the underlying leasehold interest that would entitle us to participate in future wells. For example, our Pivotal Acquisition in 2018 consisted primarily of producing wellbore interests without associated future development rights. Future oil and natural gas production, therefore, is highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves that are economically recoverable. We cannot assure you that we will be able to find or acquire and develop additional reserves at an acceptable cost.\nWe may acquire significant amounts of unproved property to further our development efforts. Development and exploratory drilling and production activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that no commercially productive reservoirs will be discovered. We seek to acquire both proved and producing properties as well as undeveloped acreage that we believe will enhance growth potential and increase our earnings over time. However, we cannot assure you that all of these properties will contain economically viable reserves or that we will not abandon our initial investments. Additionally, we cannot assure you that unproved reserves or undeveloped acreage that we acquire will be profitably developed, that new wells drilled on our properties will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investments in our properties and reserves.\nAs a non-operator, our development of successful operations relies extensively on third-parties, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation.\nWe have only participated in wells operated by third parties. The success of our business operations depends on the timing of drilling activities and success of our third-party operators. If our operators are not successful in the development, exploitation, production and exploration activities relating to our leasehold interests, or are unable or unwilling to perform, our financial condition and results of operation would be materially adversely affected.\nThese risks are heightened in a low commodity price environment, which may present significant challenges to our operators. The challenges and risks faced by our operators may be similar to or greater than our own, including with respect to their ability to service their debt, remain in compliance with their debt instruments and, if necessary, access additional capital. Certain oil and gas operators filed for bankruptcy as a result of the low commodity price environment that began in 2014 and a low commodity price environment could result in additional operators being forced into bankruptcy. The insolvency of an operator of any of our properties, the failure of an operator of any of our properties to adequately perform operations or an operator\u2019s breach of applicable agreements could reduce our production and revenue and result in our liability to governmental authorities for compliance with environmental, safety and other regulatory requirements, to the operator\u2019s suppliers and vendors and to royalty owners under oil and gas leases jointly owned with the operator or another insolvent owner. Finally, an operator of our properties may have the right, if another non-operator fails to pay its share of costs because of its insolvency or otherwise, to require us to pay our proportionate share of the defaulting party\u2019s share of costs.\nOur operators will make decisions in connection with their operations (subject to their contractual and legal obligations to other owners of working interests), which may not be in our best interests.\nAdditionally, we may have virtually no ability to exercise influence over the operational decisions of our operators, including the setting of capital expenditure budgets and drilling locations and schedules. Dependence on our operators could prevent us from realizing our target returns for those locations. The success and timing of development activities by our operators will depend on a number of factors that will largely be outside of our control, including:\n\u2022oil and natural gas prices and other factors generally affecting industry operating environment;\n\u2022the timing and amount of capital expenditures;\n\u2022their expertise and financial resources;\n\u2022approval of other participants in drilling wells;\n\u2022selection of technology; and\n\u2022the rate of production of reserves, if any.\nWe could experience periods of higher costs as activity levels in the Williston Basin fluctuate or if commodity prices rise. These increases could reduce our profitability, cash flow, and ability to complete development activities as planned.\nThe recent rise in commodity prices has increased activity and investment in the Williston Basin. As a result of increased activity in the Williston Basin, competition for equipment, labor and supplies is also expected to increase. Likewise, higher oil, natural gas and NGL prices generally increase the demand for equipment, labor and supplies, and can lead to shortages of, and increasing costs for, drilling equipment, services and personnel. Shortages of, or increasing costs for, experienced drilling crews and equipment and services could restrict our operating partners\u2019 ability to drill the wells and conduct the operations that we currently expect.\nIn addition, capital and operating costs in the oil and natural gas industry have generally risen during periods of increasing commodity prices as producers seek to increase production in order to capitalize on higher commodity prices. In situations where cost inflation exceeds commodity price inflation, our profitability and cash flow, and our operators\u2019 ability to complete development activities as scheduled and on budget, may be negatively impacted. Any delay in the drilling of new wells or significant increase in drilling costs could reduce our revenues and cash available to make payments on our debt obligations.\nOur lack of industry and geographical diversification may increase the risk of an investment in our company.\nOur business focus is on the oil and natural gas industry in properties that are primarily in the areas of the Williston Basin located in Montana and North Dakota. While other companies may have the ability to manage their risk by diversification, the narrow focus of our business, in terms of both the industry focus and geographic scope of our business, means that we will likely be impacted more acutely by factors affecting our industry or the region in which we operate than we would if our business were more diversified. As a result of the narrow focus of our business, we may be disproportionately exposed to the effects of regional supply and demand factors, delays or interruptions of production from wells in this area caused by governmental regulation, processing or transportation capacity constraints, market limitations, weather events or interruption of the processing or transportation of oil or natural gas. Additionally, we may be exposed to further risks, such as changes in field-wide rules and regulations that could cause us to permanently or temporarily shut-in all of our wells within the Williston Basin.\nLocations that the operators of our properties decide to drill may not yield oil or natural gas in commercially viable quantities.\nThe cost of drilling, completing and operating a well is often uncertain, and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a well. Our efforts will be uneconomical if the operators of our properties drill dry holes or wells that are productive but do not produce enough to be commercially viable after drilling, operating and other costs. If the operators of our properties drill future wells that are identified as dry holes, the drilling success rate would decline and may adversely affect our results of operations.\nTo the extent we are unable to obtain future hedges at attractive prices or our derivative activities are not effective, our cash flows and financial condition may be adversely impacted.\nTo achieve more predictable cash flows and reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in the price of oil, we enter into derivative instrument contracts for a portion of our expected oil production, including swaps, collars, puts and basis swaps. In accordance with applicable accounting principles, we are required to record our derivatives at fair market value, and they are included on our balance sheet as assets or liabilities and in our statements of income as gain (loss) on derivatives, net. Accordingly, our earnings may fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in the fair market value of our derivative instruments.\nOur derivatives activities could result in financial losses or could reduce our cash flow.\nWe enter into swaps, collars or other derivatives arrangements from time to time to hedge our expected production depending on projected production levels and expected market conditions. While intended to mitigate the effects of volatile oil and natural gas prices, such transactions may limit our potential gains and increase our potential losses if oil and natural gas prices were to rise substantially over the price established by the hedge.\nOur actual future production may be significantly higher or lower than we estimate at the time we enter into derivative contracts for such period. If the actual amount of production is higher than we estimate, we will have greater commodity price exposure than we intended. If the actual amount of production is lower than the notional amount that is subject to our derivative financial instruments, we might be forced to satisfy all or a portion of our derivative transactions without the benefit of the cash flow from our sale of the underlying physical commodity, resulting in a substantial diminution of our liquidity. As a result of these factors, our hedging activities may not be as effective as we intend in reducing the volatility of our cash flows, and in certain circumstances may actually increase the volatility of our cash flows. In addition, such transactions may expose us to the risk of loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which:\n\u2022a counterparty to our derivative contracts is unable to satisfy its obligations under the contracts;\n\u2022our production is less than expected; or\n\u2022there is a widening of price differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the derivative arrangement.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nWe have net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards that we may use to offset against taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes. At December 31, 2018, we had an estimated NOL carryforward of approximately $370.5 million for United States federal income tax purposes. In general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cIRC\u201d), a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d can be subject to limitations on the use of its NOLs to offset future taxable income. We underwent an \u201cownership change\u201d during 2018 and, as a result, the use of our existing NOL carryforwards are subject to limitations under Section 382, which are generally determined by multiplying the value of our stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long term tax exempt rate as defined in Section 382. See Note 10 to our financial statements. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could result in an additional ownership change under Section 382 of the IRC.\nChanges in United States federal income tax law may have an adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations or financial condition overall\nOn December 22, 2017, the President signed into law Public Law No. 115-97, a comprehensive tax reform bill commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cAct\u201d) that significantly reformed the IRC. The Act, among other things, (i) reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate, (ii) repeals the corporate alternative minimum tax, (iii) eliminates the deduction for certain domestic production activities, (iv) imposes new limitations on the utilization of net operating losses, and (v) provides for more general changes to the taxation of corporations, including changes to cost recovery rules and to the deductibility of interest expense, which may impact the taxation of oil and gas companies. The Act is complex and far-reaching and we cannot predict with certainty the resulting impact its enactment has on us. The ultimate impact of the Act may differ from our estimates due to changes in interpretations and assumptions made by us as well as additional regulatory guidance that may be issued and any such changes in interpretations or assumptions could adversely affect our business and financial condition. See Note 10 to our financial statements.\nCertain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to natural gas and oil exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation.\nIn past years, legislation has been proposed that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to U.S. tax laws, including certain key U.S. federal income tax provisions currently available to oil and gas companies. Such legislative changes have included, but not been limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for natural gas and oil properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, and (iii) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. Although these provisions were largely unchanged in the Tax Act, Congress could consider, and could include, some or all of these proposals as part of future tax reform legislation. Moreover, other more general features of any additional tax reform legislation, including changes to cost recovery rules, may be developed that also would change the taxation of oil and gas companies. It is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted in future legislation and, if enacted, how soon any such changes could take effect. The passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals or any similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that currently are available with respect to oil and gas development or increase costs, and any such changes could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated proved reserves.\nWe base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves using a 12-month average price and costs in effect on the day of the estimate. However, actual future net cash flows from our oil and natural gas properties will be affected by factors such as:\n\u2022the volume, pricing and duration of our oil and natural gas hedging contracts;\n\u2022actual prices we receive for oil, natural gas and NGLs;\n\u2022our actual operating costs in producing oil, natural gas and NGLs;\n\u2022the amount and timing of our capital expenditures;\n\u2022the amount and timing of actual production; and\n\u2022changes in governmental regulations or taxation.\nThe timing of both our production and our incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves, and thus their actual present value. In addition, the 10% discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and natural gas industry in general. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business depends on oil and natural gas transportation and processing facilities and other assets that are owned by third parties.\nThe marketability of our oil and natural gas depends in part on the availability, proximity and capacity of pipeline systems, processing facilities, oil trucking fleets and rail transportation assets owned by third parties. The lack of available capacity on these systems and facilities, whether as a result of proration, physical damage, scheduled maintenance or other reasons, could result in a substantial increase in costs, the shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for our properties. The negative effects arising from these and similar circumstances may last for an extended period of time. In many cases, operators are provided only with limited, if any, notice as to when these circumstances will arise and their duration. In addition, many of our wells are drilled in locations in the Williston Basin that are serviced to a limited extent, if at all, by gathering and transportation pipelines, which may or may not have sufficient capacity to transport production from all of the wells in the area. As a result, we rely on third party oil trucking to transport a significant portion of our production to third party transportation pipelines, rail loading facilities and other market access points. Any significant curtailment in gathering system or pipeline capacity, or the unavailability of sufficient third party trucking or rail capacity, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCertain of our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established or operations are commenced on units containing the acreage or the leases are extended.\nA significant portion of our acreage is not currently held by production or held by operations. Unless production in paying quantities is established or operations are commenced on units containing these leases during their terms, the leases will expire. If our leases expire and we are unable to renew the leases, we will lose our right to participate in the development of the related properties. Drilling plans for these areas are generally in the discretion of third party operators and are subject to change based on various factors that are beyond our control, such as: the availability and cost of capital, equipment, services and personnel; seasonal conditions; regulatory and third party approvals; oil, NGL and natural gas prices; results of title work; gathering system and other transportation constraints; drilling costs and results; and production costs. As of December 31, 2018, we estimate that we had leases that were not developed that represented 5,160 net acres potentially expiring in 2019, 907 net acres potentially expiring in 2020, 1,428 net acres potentially expiring in 2021, 2,056 net acres expiring in 2022, and 3,324 and net acres potentially expiring in 2023 and beyond.\nSeasonal weather conditions adversely affect operators\u2019 ability to conduct drilling activities in the areas where our properties are located.\nSeasonal weather conditions can limit drilling and producing activities and other operations in our operating areas and as a result, a majority of the drilling on our properties is generally performed during the summer and fall months. These seasonal constraints can pose challenges for meeting well drilling objectives and increase competition for equipment, supplies and personnel during the summer and fall months, which could lead to shortages and increase costs or delay operations. Additionally, many municipalities impose weight restrictions on the paved roads that lead to jobsites due to the muddy conditions caused by spring thaws. This could limit access to jobsites and operators\u2019 ability to service wells in these areas.\nSignificant capital expenditures are required to develop our properties and replace our reserves.\nOur exploration, development and acquisition activities require substantial capital expenditures. Historically, we have funded our capital expenditures through a combination of cash flow from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, debt issuances, and equity issuances. We have also engaged in asset sales from time to time. If our access to capital were limited due to numerous factors, which could include a decrease in operating cash flow due to lower oil and natural gas prices or decreased production or deterioration of the credit and capital markets, we would have a reduced ability to develop our properties and replace our reserves. We may not be able to incur additional debt under our revolving credit facility, issue debt or\nequity, engage in asset sales or access other methods of financing on acceptable terms to develop our properties and/or meet our reserve replacement requirements.\nWe may be unable to obtain additional capital that we will require to implement our business plan.\nFuture acquisitions and future exploration, development, production and marketing activities, will require a substantial amount of capital. Cash reserves, cash from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility may not be sufficient to fund both our continuing operations and our planned growth. We may require additional capital to continue to grow our business through acquisitions and to further expand our exploration and development programs. We may be unable to obtain additional capital if and when required.\nWe may pursue sources of additional capital through various financing transactions or arrangements, including joint venturing of projects, debt financing, equity financing or other means. We may not be successful in consummating suitable financing transactions in the time period required or at all, and we may not be able to obtain the capital we require by other means. If the amount of capital we are able to raise from financing activities, together with our cash from operations, is not sufficient to satisfy our capital requirements, we may not be able to implement our business plan and may be required to scale back our operations, sell assets at unattractive prices or obtain financing on unattractive terms, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe development of our proved undeveloped reserves in the Williston Basin and other areas of operation may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate. Therefore, our undeveloped reserves may not be ultimately developed or produced.\nApproximately 44% of our estimated net proved reserves volumes were classified as proved undeveloped as of December 31, 2018. Development of these reserves may take longer and require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate. Delays in the development of our reserves or increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves will reduce the PV-10 value of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves and future net revenues estimated for such reserves and may result in some projects becoming uneconomic. In addition, delays in the development of reserves could cause us to have to reclassify our proved reserves as unproved reserves.\nOur acquisition strategy will subject us to certain risks associated with the inherent uncertainty in evaluating properties for which we have limited information.\nWe intend to expand our operations in part through acquisitions. Our decision to acquire a property will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained from production reports and engineering studies, geophysical and geological analyses and seismic and other information, the results of which are often inconclusive and subject to various interpretations. Also, our reviews of acquired properties are inherently incomplete because it generally is not economically feasible to perform an in-depth review of the individual properties involved in each acquisition. Even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and potential. Inspections are often not performed on properties being acquired, and environmental matters, such as subsurface contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken.\nAny acquisition involves other potential risks, including, among other things:\n\u2022the validity of our assumptions about reserves, future production, revenues and costs;\n\u2022a decrease in our liquidity by using a significant portion of our cash from operations or borrowing capacity to finance acquisitions;\n\u2022a significant increase in our interest expense or financial leverage if we incur additional debt to finance acquisitions;\n\u2022the ultimate value of any contingent consideration agreed to be paid in an acquisition;\n\u2022dilution to shareholders if we use equity as consideration for, or to finance, acquisitions;\n\u2022the assumption of unknown liabilities, losses or costs for which we are not indemnified or for which our indemnity is inadequate;\n\u2022an inability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel to manage and operate our growing business and assets; and\n\u2022an increase in our costs or a decrease in our revenues associated with any potential royalty owner or landowner claims or disputes.\nContingent consideration payable pursuant to existing or future agreements could adversely impact our results of operation, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe have in the past, and may in the future, enter into agreements that provide for the potential payment by us of additional consideration depending on actual performance against established criteria. Recent agreements of this type include the acquisition agreements we entered into during 2018 in connection with the Pivotal Acquisition and the W Energy Acquisition (see Note 3 to our financial statements), as well as certain exchange agreements we entered into during 2018 with holders of our senior unsecured notes (see Note 4 to our financial statements), each of which require us to pay additional consideration to the counterparties if our stock price does not trade at or above agreed upon levels over specified periods. The liabilities associated with the potential additional consideration under the Pivotal and W Energy acquisition agreements are recognized at fair value and recorded as contingent consideration liabilities on the Company\u2019s condensed balance sheets. The liabilities associated with the potential additional consideration under the debt exchange agreements are recognized at fair value and recorded as debt exchange derivative liabilities on the Company\u2019s condensed balance sheets. These fair values may change significantly over time, with the fair value of these liabilities generally decreasing if our average stock price increases or increasing if our average stock price decreases, and such changes are recorded in other income (expense) on the Company\u2019s condensed statement of operations. We are permitted in certain circumstances to settle amounts owed in either cash or shares of common stock. Regardless, changes in the fair value of these liabilities, and amounts we are required to pay over time, could adversely impact our results of operation, cash flows and financial condition.\nThe loss of any member of our management team, upon whose knowledge, relationships with industry participants, leadership and technical expertise we rely could diminish our ability to conduct our operations and harm our ability to execute our business plan.\nOur success depends heavily upon the continued contributions of those members of our management team whose knowledge, relationships with industry participants, leadership and technical expertise would be difficult to replace. In particular, our ability to successfully acquire additional properties, to increase our reserves, to participate in drilling opportunities and to identify and enter into commercial arrangements depends on developing and maintaining close working relationships with industry participants. In addition, our ability to select and evaluate suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment is dependent on our management team\u2019s knowledge and expertise in the industry. To continue to develop our business, we rely on our management team\u2019s knowledge and expertise in the industry and will use our management team\u2019s relationships with industry participants to enter into strategic relationships, which may take the form of joint ventures with other private parties and contractual arrangements with other oil and natural gas companies.\nThe members of our management team may terminate their employment with our company at any time. If we were to lose members of our management team, we may not be able to replace the knowledge that they possess. In addition, we may not be able to establish or maintain strategic relationships with industry participants. If we were to lose the services of the members of our management team, our ability to conduct our operations and execute our business plan could be materially harmed.\nDeficiencies of title to our leased interests could significantly affect our financial condition.\nWe typically do not incur the expense of a title examination prior to acquiring oil and natural gas leases or undivided interests in oil and natural gas leases or other developed rights. If an examination of the title history of a property reveals that an oil or natural gas lease or other developed rights have been purchased in error from a person who is not the owner of the mineral interest desired, our interest would substantially decline in value or be eliminated. In such cases, the amount paid for such oil or natural gas lease or leases or other developed rights may be lost. It is generally our practice not to incur the expense of retaining lawyers to examine the title to the mineral interest to be acquired. Rather, we typically rely upon the judgment of oil and natural gas lease brokers or landmen who perform the fieldwork in examining records in the appropriate governmental or county clerk\u2019s office before attempting to acquire a lease or other developed rights in a specific mineral interest.\nPrior to drilling an oil or natural gas well, however, it is the normal practice in the oil and natural gas industry for the person or company acting as the operator of the well to obtain a preliminary title review of the spacing unit within which the\nproposed oil or natural gas well is to be drilled to ensure there are no obvious deficiencies in title to the well. Frequently, as a result of such examinations, certain curative work must be done to correct deficiencies in the marketability of the title, such as obtaining affidavits of heirship or causing an estate to be administered. Such curative work entails expense, and the operator may elect to proceed with a well despite defects to the title identified in the preliminary title opinion. Furthermore, title issues may arise at a later date that were not initially detected in any title review or examination. Any one or more of the foregoing could require us to reverse revenues previously recognized and potentially negatively affect our cash flows and results of operations. Our failure to obtain perfect title to our leaseholds may adversely affect our current production and reserves and our ability in the future to increase production and reserves.\nCompetition may limit our ability to obtain rights to explore and develop oil and natural gas reserves.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. Other oil and natural gas companies may seek to acquire oil and natural gas leases and other properties and services we will need to operate our business in the areas in which we expect to operate. Additionally, other companies engaged in our line of business may compete with us from time to time in obtaining capital from investors. Competitors include larger companies which, in particular, may have access to greater resources, may be more successful in the recruitment and retention of qualified employees and may conduct their own refining and petroleum marketing operations, which may give them a competitive advantage. In addition, actual or potential competitors may be strengthened through the acquisition of additional assets and interests. If we are unable to compete effectively or respond adequately to competitive pressures, our results of operation and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nInsufficient transportation or refining capacity in the Williston Basin could cause significant fluctuations in our realized oil and natural gas prices.\nThe Williston Basin crude oil business environment has historically been characterized by periods when oil production has surpassed local transportation and refining capacity, resulting in substantial discounts in the price received for crude oil versus prices quoted for WTI crude oil. Although additional Williston Basin transportation takeaway capacity has been added over the last several years, production also increased substantially during the same period. The increased production coupled with delays in rail car arrivals and commissioning of rail loading facilities has caused price differentials to significantly increase at times.\nCrude oil from the Bakken/Three Forks formations may pose unique hazards that may have an adverse effect on our operations.\nIn 2015, the U.S. Department of Transportation (\u201cUSDOT\u201d) concluded that crude oil from the Bakken/ Three Forks formations has a higher volatility than most other U.S. crude oil and thus is more ignitable and flammable. Based on that information, and several fires involving rail transportation of crude oil, USDOT issued a rail safety rule in 2015 that included new construction standards for rail tank cars constructed after October 1, 2015. The final rule created a new North American tank car standard known as the DOT Specification 117 (\u201cDOT-117\u201d) rail car with thicker steel and redesigned bottom outlet valves, among other improvements over the then-standard DOT Specification 111 (\u201cDOT-111\u201d) tank car. The final rule established a schedule for retrofitting or replacing older tank cars and included mandates for using electronically controlled pneumatic (\u201cECP\u201d) braking systems and for performing routing analyses, among other requirements. In December 2017, the USDOT repealed the ECP provisions of the 2015 rail safety rule. USDOT issued a final rule in 2019 expanding the applicability of oil spill response plans for high-hazard flammable trains. In addition, the rail industry has adopted increased precautions for crude shipments. Any new restrictions that significantly affect transportation of crude oil production could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business involves the selling and shipping by rail of crude oil, including from the Bakken shale, which involves risks of derailment, accidents and liabilities associated with cleanup and damages, as well as potential regulatory changes that may adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nA portion of our crude oil production is transported to market centers by rail. Derailments in North America of trains transporting crude oil have caused various regulatory agencies and industry organizations, as well as federal, state and municipal governments, to focus attention on transportation by rail of flammable materials. Transportation safety regulators in the United States and Canada are concerned that crude oil from the Bakken shale may be more flammable than crude oil from other producing regions and are investigating that issue and are also considering changes to existing regulations to address those possible risks, as noted directly above. In May 2015, USDOT\u2019s Pipelines and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (\u201cPHMSA\u201d) adopted a final rule that, among other things, imposed a new and enhanced tank car design standard for certain tank cars carrying crude oil and ethanol, a phase out by as early as January 2018 for older DOT-111 tank cars that were not retrofitted, and a classification and testing program for unrefined petroleum based products, including crude oil. The rule also\nincluded new operational requirements such as routing analyses, speed restrictions and enhanced braking controls. However, in December 2017, the USDOT repealed the enhanced braking control provisions of the May 2015 rail safety rule. USDOT is expected to issue a final rule in 2018 expanding the applicability of oil spill response plans for high-hazard flammable trains. Transport Canada has also issued legal requirements that align with the rule adopted by PHMSA, including standards relating to train speed restrictions, route risk analyses and a phase out of non-compliant DOT-111 tank cars.\nAny changes to existing laws and regulations, or promulgation of new laws and regulations, including any voluntary measures by the rail industry, that result in new requirements for the design, construction or operation of tank cars used to transport crude oil could increase our costs of doing business and limit our ability to transport and sell our crude oil at favorable prices at market centers throughout the United States, the consequences of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nTo the extent that new regulations require design changes or other modifications of tank cars, we may incur significant constraints on transportation capacity during the period while tank cars are being retrofitted or newly constructed to comply with the new regulations. In addition, any derailment of crude oil from the Bakken shale involving crude oil that we have sold or are shipping may result in claims being brought against us that may involve significant liabilities. Although we believe that we are adequately insured against such events, we cannot assure you that our insurance policies will cover the entirety of any damages that may arise from such an event.\nMarket conditions or operational impediments may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production.\nMarket conditions or the unavailability of satisfactory oil and natural gas transportation arrangements may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production. The availability of a ready market for our oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors, including the demand for and supply of oil and natural gas and the proximity of reserves to pipelines and terminal facilities. Our ability to market our production depends, in substantial part, on the availability and capacity of gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities owned and operated by third-parties. Our failure to obtain such services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business. We may be required to shut in wells due to lack of a market or inadequacy or unavailability of crude oil or natural gas pipelines or gathering system capacity. If our production becomes shut-in for any of these or other reasons, we would be unable to realize revenue from those wells until other arrangements were made to deliver the products to market.\nWe depend on computer and telecommunications systems, and failures in our systems or cyber security attacks could significantly disrupt our business operations.\nWe have entered into agreements with third parties for hardware, software, telecommunications and other information technology services in connection with our business. In addition, we have developed or may develop proprietary software systems, management techniques and other information technologies incorporating software licensed from third parties. It is possible that we, or these third parties, could incur interruptions from cyber security attacks, computer viruses or malware, or that third party service providers could cause a breach of our data. We believe that we have positive relations with our related vendors and maintain adequate anti-virus and malware software and controls; however, any interruptions to our arrangements with third parties for our computing and communications infrastructure or any other interruptions to, or breaches of, our information systems could lead to data corruption, communication interruption, loss of sensitive or confidential information or otherwise significantly disrupt our business operations. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor these threats and mitigate our exposure to such threats, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient in preventing security threats from materializing. To our knowledge we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber attacks; however, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer material losses in the future either as a result of an interruption to or a breach of our systems or those of our third party vendors and service providers.\nWe are subject to litigation and adverse outcomes in such litigation could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe are, and from time to time may become, subject to litigation and various legal proceedings, including stockholder derivative suits, class action lawsuits and other matters, that involve claims for substantial amounts of money or for other relief or that might necessitate changes to our business or operations. For example, in August 2016, Jeffrey Fries, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, filed a class action complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company. The complaint was amended in January 2018 and alleged violations of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Although this particular complaint was ultimately dismissed, the defense of these actions may be both time consuming and expensive. We evaluate these litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. Based on these assessments and estimates, we\nmay establish reserves and/or disclose the relevant litigation claims or legal proceedings, as and when required or appropriate. These assessments and estimates are based on information available to management at the time of such assessment or estimation and involve a significant amount of judgment. As a result, actual outcomes or losses could differ materially from those envisioned by our current assessments and estimates. Our failure to successfully defend or settle any litigation or legal proceedings could result in liability that, to the extent not covered by our insurance, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAllegations and proceedings concerning our founder, chairman emeritus and president could generate negative publicity for us, harm our reputation and adversely affect our business.\nOur founder, chairman emeritus and president, Michael Reger, has played a key role in the development and success of our business. Mr. Reger has been the subject of proceedings and lawsuits in connection with alleged securities violations as a co-founder of Dakota Plains Holdings, Inc. These proceedings included administrative proceedings instituted by the SEC for alleged federal securities laws violations related to Mr. Reger\u2019s alleged failure to adequately disclose his ownership and control of Dakota Plains Holdings, Inc., which Mr. Reger settled in October 2016 without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s findings. Any future proceedings or allegations against Mr. Reger could result in negative press speculation, as well as adverse perceptions of him or us among the public, our industry or in the capital markets, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur derivative activities expose us to potential regulatory risks.\nThe Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d), Federal Regulatory Commission (\u201cFERC\u201d) and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d) have statutory authority to monitor certain segments of the physical and futures energy commodities markets. These agencies have imposed broad regulations prohibiting fraud and manipulation of such markets. With regard to derivative activities that we undertake with respect to oil, natural gas, NGLs, or other energy commodities, we are required to observe the market-related regulations enforced by these agencies. Failure to comply with such regulations, as interpreted and enforced, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nLegislative and regulatory developments could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price, interest rate and other risks associated with our business.\nIn July of 2010, the United States Congress enacted the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (\u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), which contains measures aimed at increasing the transparency and stability of the over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) derivatives market and preventing excessive speculation. In November 2013, the CFTC re-proposed implementing regulations imposing position limits for certain physical commodity contracts in the major energy markets and economically equivalent futures, options and swaps, with exemptions for certain bona fide hedging positions. The CFTC\u2019s initial position limit rules were vacated by a federal court in 2012. It is not clear when the re-proposed rules on position limits would become effective. CFTC rules under the Dodd-Frank Act also may impose clearing and trade execution requirements in connection with our derivatives activities, although currently those requirements do not extend to derivatives based on physical commodities in the energy markets and some or all of our derivatives activities may be exempt from such requirements based on our non-financial end-user status.\nRegulations issued under the Dodd-Frank Act also may require certain counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivative activities to a separate entity, which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparty. The final rules are being phased in over time depending on the finalization of certain other rules to be promulgated jointly by the CFTC and the SEC. The legislation and regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts (including from swap recordkeeping and reporting requirements and through requirements to post collateral which could adversely affect our available liquidity), materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts, and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. We maintain an active hedging program related to oil price risks. The Dodd-Frank Act and rules and regulations thereunder could reduce trading positions and the market-making activities of our counterparties. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of legislation and regulations or any resulting changes in the derivatives markets, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures or to make payments on our debt obligations. Finally, the legislation was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas. Our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the legislation and regulations is to lower commodity prices. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, our financial condition, and our results of operations.\nOur business is subject to complex federal, state, local and other laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.\nOur operational interests, as operated by our third-party operating partners, are regulated extensively at the federal, state, tribal and local levels. Environmental and other governmental laws and regulations have increased the costs to plan, design, drill, install, operate and abandon oil and natural gas wells. Under these laws and regulations, our company (either directly or indirectly through our operating partners) could also be liable for personal injuries, property and natural resource damage and other damages. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the suspension or termination of our business and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties. Moreover, public interest in environmental protection has increased in recent years, and environmental organizations have opposed, with some success, certain drilling projects.\nPart of the regulatory environment in which we do business includes, in some cases, legal requirements for obtaining environmental assessments, environmental impact studies and/or plans of development before commencing drilling and production activities. In addition, our activities are subject to the regulations regarding conservation practices and protection of correlative rights. These regulations affect our business and limit the quantity of natural gas we may produce and sell. A major risk inherent in the drilling plans in which we participate is the need for our operators to obtain drilling permits from state and local authorities. Delays in obtaining regulatory approvals or drilling permits, the failure to obtain a drilling permit for a well or the receipt of a permit with unreasonable conditions or costs could have a material adverse effect on the development of our properties. Additionally, the oil and natural gas regulatory environment could change in ways that might substantially increase the financial and managerial costs of compliance with these laws and regulations and, consequently, adversely affect our profitability. At this time, we cannot predict the effect of this increase on our results of operations. Furthermore, we may be put at a competitive disadvantage to larger companies in our industry that can spread these additional costs over a greater number of wells and larger operating staff.\nEnvironmental risks may adversely affect our business.\nAll phases of the oil and natural gas business can present environmental risks and hazards and are subject to environmental regulation pursuant to a variety of federal, state and municipal laws and regulations. Environmental legislation provides for, among other things, restrictions and prohibitions on spills, releases or emissions of various substances produced in association with oil and natural gas operations. The legislation also requires that wells and facility sites be operated, maintained, abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities. There is risk of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities as a result of the handling of petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes, air emissions and wastewater discharges related to our business, and historical operations and waste disposal practices. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, loss of our leases, incurrence of investigatory or remedial obligations and the imposition of injunctive relief.\nEnvironmental legislation is evolving in a manner we expect may result in stricter standards and enforcement, larger fines and liability and potentially increased capital expenditures and operating costs. The discharge of oil, natural gas or other pollutants into the air, soil or water may give rise to liabilities to governments and third parties and may require us to incur costs to remedy such discharge, regardless of whether we were responsible for the release or contamination and regardless of whether our operating partners met previous standards in the industry at the time they were conducted. In addition, claims for damages to persons, property or natural resources may result from environmental and other impacts of operations on our properties. The application of environmental laws to our business may cause us to curtail production or increase the costs of our production, development or exploration activities.\nFederal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.\nHydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. Hydraulic fracturing is used extensively by our third- party operating partners. The hydraulic fracturing process is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. Any federal or state legislative or regulatory changes with respect to hydraulic fracturing could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs or result in operational delays, and the consequences of any failure to comply by us or our third-party operating partners could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, in response to concerns relating to recent seismic events near underground disposal wells used for the disposal by injection of flowback and produced water or certain other oilfield fluids resulting from oil and natural gas activities (so-called \u201cinduced seismicity\u201d), regulators in some states have imposed, or are considering imposing, additional requirements in the permitting of produced water disposal wells or otherwise to assess any relationship between seismicity and the use of\nsuch wells. States may, from time to time, develop and implement plans directing certain wells where seismic incidents have occurred to restrict or suspend disposal well operations. These developments could result in additional regulation and restrictions on the use of injection wells by our operators to dispose of flowback and produced water and certain other oilfield fluids. Increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity also could lead to greater opposition to, and litigation concerning, oil and natural gas activities utilizing injection wells for waste disposal. Until such pending or threatened legislation or regulations are finalized and implemented, it is not possible to estimate their impact on our business.\nAny of the above risks could impair our ability to manage our business and have a material adverse effect on our operations, cash flows and financial position.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce.\nVarious state governments and regional organizations have considered enacting new legislation and promulgating new regulations governing or restricting the emission of \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d (\u201cGHG\u201d) from stationary sources such as our equipment and operations. At the federal levels, the EPA has determined that emissions of certain GHG present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on its findings, the EPA has begun adopting and implementing regulations to restrict emissions of GHG.\nIn addition, the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of GHG, though it is yet to do so, and almost one-half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHG primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs. Most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions, such as electric power plants or major producers of fuels, such as refineries and gas processing plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances that correspond to their annual emissions of GHGs. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year in an effort to achieve the overall GHG reduction goal. As the number of GHG emission allowances declines each year, the cost or value of such allowances is expected to escalate significantly.\nAdditionally, in December 2015, the U.S. joined the international community at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France that prepared an agreement requiring member countries to review and \u201crepresent a progression\u201d in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set GHG emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020. This \u201cParis Agreement\u201d was signed by the United States in April 2016 and entered in force in November 2016; however, this agreement does not create any binding obligations for nations to limit their GHG emissions, but rather includes pledges to voluntarily limit or reduce future emissions. In August 2017, the U.S. State Department informed the United Nations of the intent of the United States to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement provides for a four-year exit process beginning when it took effect in November 2016, which would result in an effective exit date of November 2020. The United States\u2019 adherence to the exit process and/or the terms on which the United States may reenter the Paris Agreement or separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time.\nThe adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce emissions of GHG could require our third-party operating partners, and indirectly us, to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil and natural gas produced by our operational interests. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of GHG could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulation of GHG emissions could also result in reduced demand for our production, as oil and natural gas consumers seek to reduce their own GHG emissions. Any regulation of GHG emissions, including through a cap-and-trade system, technology mandate, emissions tax, reporting requirement or other program, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, to the extent climate change results in more severe weather and significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, droughts and other climatic effects, our own, our third-party operating partners or our customers\u2019 operations may be disrupted, which could result in a decrease in our available products or reduce our customers\u2019 demand for our products.\nFurther, there have been various legislative and regulatory proposals at the federal and state levels to provide incentives and subsidies to (i) shift more power generation to renewable energy sources and (ii) support technological advances to drive less energy consumption. These incentives and subsidies could have a negative impact on oil, natural gas and NGL consumption.\nAny of the above risks could impair our ability to manage our business and have a material adverse effect on our operations, cash flows and financial position.\nDecommissioning costs are unknown and may be substantial. Unplanned costs could divert resources from other projects.\nWe may become responsible for costs associated with plugging, abandoning and reclaiming wells, pipelines and other facilities that we use for production of oil and natural gas reserves. Abandonment and reclamation of these facilities and the costs associated therewith is often referred to as \u201cdecommissioning.\u201d We accrue a liability for decommissioning costs associated with our wells, but have not established any cash reserve account for these potential costs in respect of any of our properties. If decommissioning is required before economic depletion of our properties or if our estimates of the costs of decommissioning exceed the value of the reserves remaining at any particular time to cover such decommissioning costs, we may have to draw on funds from other sources to satisfy such costs. The use of other funds to satisfy such decommissioning costs could impair our ability to focus capital investment in other areas of our business.\nOur revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our senior secured notes contain operating and financial restrictions that may restrict our business and financing activities.\nOur revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our senior secured notes contain, and any future indebtedness we incur may contain, a number of restrictive covenants that will impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022declare or pay any dividend or make any other distributions on, purchase or redeem our equity interests or purchase or redeem certain debt;\n\u2022make loans or certain investments;\n\u2022make certain acquisitions and investments;\n\u2022incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain types of equity securities;\n\u2022incur liens;\n\u2022transfer or sell assets;\n\u2022create subsidiaries\n\u2022consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022engage in transactions with our affiliates.\nIn addition, the revolving credit facility requires us to maintain compliance with certain financial covenants and other covenants. As a result of these covenants, we could be limited in the manner in which we conduct our business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs.\nOur ability to comply with some of the covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate, our ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. A failure to comply with the covenants, ratios or tests in our revolving credit facility or any future indebtedness could result in an event of default under our revolving credit facility or our future indebtedness, which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If an event of default under our revolving credit facility occurs and remains uncured, the lenders thereunder:\n\u2022would not be required to lend any additional amounts to us;\n\u2022could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be due and payable;\n\u2022may have the ability to require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings; and\n\u2022may prevent us from making debt service payments under our other agreements.\nAn event of default or an acceleration under our revolving credit facility could result in an event of default and an acceleration under other existing or future indebtedness, including the indenture governing the senior secured notes. Conversely, an event of default or an acceleration under any other existing or future indebtedness could result in an event of default and an acceleration under our revolving credit facility. In addition, our obligations under the revolving credit facility and the senior secured notes are collateralized by perfected liens and security interests on substantially all of our assets and if we default thereunder the lenders could seek to foreclose on our assets.\nOur revolving credit facility limits the amounts we can borrow up to a borrowing base amount, which the administrative agent in good faith and in accordance with its usual and customary oil and gas lending criteria as they exist at the particular time will determine and be approved by the required lenders or all lenders on a semi- annual basis based upon projected revenues from our natural gas properties pursuant to engineering reports provided to the administrative agent. In addition to the scheduled redeterminations, we, the administrative agent and the required lenders have the right to request one additional borrowing base redetermination during each period between scheduled redeterminations. Any increase in the borrowing base requires the consent of all lenders. Subject to customary grace periods, we will be required to repay outstanding borrowings in excess of the borrowing base. The borrowing base will also automatically decrease upon the issuance of certain debt, the sale or other disposition of certain assets in excess of 5% of the borrowing base then in effect and the early termination of certain swap agreements.\nWe may not be able to generate enough cash flow to meet our debt obligations.\nWe expect our earnings and cash flow to vary significantly from year to year due to the cyclical nature of our industry. As a result, the amount of debt that we can service in some periods may not be appropriate for us in other periods. Additionally, our future cash flow may be insufficient to meet our debt obligations and commitments. Any insufficiency could negatively impact our business. A range of economic, competitive, business and industry factors will affect our future financial performance, and, as a result, our ability to generate cash flow from operations and to pay our debt. Many of these factors, such as oil and natural gas prices, economic and financial conditions in our industry and the global economy or competitive initiatives of our competitors, are beyond our control.\nIf we do not generate enough cash flow from operations to satisfy our debt obligations, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as:\n\u2022refinancing or restructuring our debt;\n\u2022selling assets;\n\u2022reducing or delaying capital investments; or\n\u2022seeking to raise additional capital.\nHowever, we cannot assure you that undertaking alternative financing plans, if necessary, would allow us to meet our debt obligations. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations, or to obtain alternative financing, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe inability of one or more of our operating partners to meet their obligations to us may adversely affect our financial results.\nOur principal exposures to credit risk are through receivables resulting from the sale of our oil and natural gas production, which operating partners market on our behalf to energy marketing companies, refineries and their affiliates.\nWe are subject to credit risk due to the concentration of our oil and natural gas receivables with a limited number of operating partners. This concentration may impact our overall credit risk since these entities may be similarly affected by changes in economic and other conditions. A low commodity price environment may strain our operating partners, which could heighten this risk. The inability or failure of our operating partners to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our financial results.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under our revolving credit facility bear interest at variable rates and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase and we are unable to effectively hedge our interest rate risk, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even if the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash available for servicing our indebtedness would decrease.\nWe may be able to incur substantially more debt. This could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.\nWe may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, subject to certain limitations, including under our revolving credit facility, our senior secured notes and under any future debt agreements. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could increase. Our level of indebtedness could, for instance, prevent us from engaging in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us or from making desirable capital expenditures. This could put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other less leveraged competitors that have more cash flow to devote to their operations. In addition, the incurrence of additional indebtedness could make it more difficult to satisfy our existing financial obligations.\nOur leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and business prospects.\nOur level of indebtedness could affect our operations in several ways, including the following:\n\u2022require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our existing debt, thereby reducing the cash available to finance our operations and other business activities and could limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business;\n\u2022limit our ability to access the capital markets to raise capital on favorable terms or to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures or acquisitions or to refinance existing indebtedness;\n\u2022place restrictions on our ability to obtain additional financing, make investments, lease equipment, sell assets and engage in business combinations;\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors with lower levels of indebtedness in relation to their overall size or less restrictive terms governing then indebtedness;\n\u2022limit our ability to deduct our net interest expense; and\n\u2022make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under the instruments governing our indebtedness and increase the risk that we may default on our debt obligations.\nOur ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions and governmental regulation. We depend on our revolving credit facility for future capital needs, because we use operating cash flows for investing activities and borrow as needed. We cannot be certain that our cash flow will be sufficient to allow us to pay the principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations. If we do not have enough money, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell assets, borrow more money or raise equity. We may not be able to refinance our debt, sell assets, borrow more money or raise equity on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Our ability to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness will be affected by the levels of cash flow from our operations and future events and circumstances beyond our control. Failure to comply with these covenants would result in an event of default under our indebtedness, and such an event of default could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur certificate of incorporation, bylaws, and Delaware state law contain provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control and may adversely affect the market price of our capital stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without any further vote or action by our shareholders. The rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future. The issuance of preferred stock could delay, deter or prevent a change in control and could adversely affect the voting power or economic value of our shares.\nIn addition, some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change of control would be beneficial to our shareholders, including, among others, limitations on the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings, limitations on the ability of our shareholders to act by written consent, and advance notice provisions for shareholders proposals and nominations for elections to the board of directors to be acted upon at meetings of shareholders.\nDelaware law generally prohibits us from engaging in any business combination with any \u201cinterested shareholder,\u201d meaning generally that a shareholder who owns 15% or more of our stock cannot acquire us for a period of three years from the date such shareholder became an interested shareholder, unless various conditions are met.\nThe availability of shares for sale in the future could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nOur board of directors has the authority, without action or vote of our stockholders, to issue all or any part of our authorized but unissued shares of common stock. In the future, we may issue securities to raise cash for acquisitions, as consideration in acquisitions to pay down debt, to fund capital expenditures or general corporate expenses, in connection with the exercise of stock options or to satisfy our obligations under our incentive plans. We may also acquire interests in other companies by using a combination of cash and our common stock or just our common stock. We may also issue securities convertible into, exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, our common stock. Any of these events may dilute your ownership interest in our company, reduce our earnings per share and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.\nBecause we do not currently pay, and are subject to restriction on paying dividends on our common stock, investors must look solely to stock appreciation for a return on their investment in us.\nWe have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock. Any payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends and other considerations that our board of directors deems relevant. Covenants contained in the instruments governing our indebtedness restrict the payment of dividends. Investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize a return on their investment.", "PERMNO": 92601, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "NOG"}
