{"cik": "1117106", "company": "NETSUITE INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nA description of the risks and uncertainties associated with our business is set forth below. If any of such risks and uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition or operating results could differ materially from the plans, projections and other forward-looking statements included in the section titled \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and elsewhere in this report and in our other public filings. In addition, if any of the following risks and uncertainties, or if any other risks and uncertainties, actually occurs, our business, financial condition or operating results could be harmed substantially, which could cause the market price of our stock to decline, perhaps significantly.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nContinued adverse economic conditions or reduced investments in cloud-based applications and information technology spending may harm our business.\nOur business depends on the overall demand for cloud-based applications and information technology spending and on the economic health and general willingness of our current and prospective customers to make capital commitments. If the conditions in the U.S. and global economic environment remain uncertain or continue to be volatile, or if they deteriorate further, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. Continued weak or volatile economic conditions, or a reduction in spending for cloud-based applications and information technology even if economic conditions improve, would likely harm our business and operating results in a number of ways, including longer sales cycles, extended payment terms, lower prices for our products and services, reduced sales, and lower customer retention rates.\nWe have a history of losses, and we may not achieve profitability in the future.\nWe have not been profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) basis during any quarterly or annual period since our formation. We experienced a net loss of $100.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. As of that date, our accumulated deficit was $549.2 million. We expect to make significant future expenditures related to the development and expansion of our business. As a result of these increased expenditures, we will have to generate and sustain increased revenue to achieve and maintain future profitability. While historically our revenue has grown, this growth may not be sustainable and we may not achieve sufficient revenue to achieve or maintain profitability. We may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including due to the other risks described in this Annual Report, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications and delays and other unknown factors. Accordingly, we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability and we may continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future.\nMany of our customers are small- and medium-sized businesses and divisions of large companies, which may result in increased costs as we attempt to reach, acquire and retain customers.\nWe market and sell our application suite to small- and medium-sized businesses and divisions of large companies. To grow our revenue quickly, we must add new customers, sell additional services to existing customers and encourage existing customers to renew their subscriptions. However, selling to and retaining small- and medium-sized businesses can be more difficult than selling to and retaining large enterprises because small- and medium-sized business customers:\n\u2022\nare more price sensitive;\n\u2022\nare more difficult to reach with broad marketing campaigns;\n\u2022\nhave high churn rates in part because of the nature of their businesses;\n\u2022\noften lack the staffing to benefit fully from our application suite\u2019s rich feature set; and\n\u2022\noften require higher sales, marketing and support expenditures by vendors that sell to them per revenue dollar generated for those vendors.\nIf we are unable to cost-effectively market and sell our service to our target customers, our ability to grow our revenue and become profitable will be harmed.\nOur business depends substantially on customers renewing, upgrading and expanding their subscriptions for our services. Any decline in our customer renewals, upgrades and expansions would harm our future operating results.\nWe sell our application suite pursuant to service agreements that are generally one year in length. Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions after their subscription period expires, and they may not renew their subscriptions at the same or higher levels. Moreover, under specific circumstances, our customers have the right to cancel their service agreements before they expire. In addition, in the first year of a subscription, customers often purchase a higher level of professional services than they do in renewal years. As a result, our ability to grow is dependent in part on customers purchasing additional subscriptions and modules after the first year of their subscriptions. We may not accurately predict future trends in customer renewals. Our customers\u2019 renewal rates may decline or fluctuate because of several factors, including their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our services, the prices of our services, the prices of services offered by our competitors or reductions in our customers\u2019 spending levels due to the macroeconomic environment or other factors. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our services, renew on less favorable terms, or do not purchase additional functionality or\nsubscriptions, our revenue may grow more slowly than expected or decline and our profitability and gross margin may be harmed.\nAny disruption of service at our data centers could interrupt or delay our ability to deliver our service to our customers.\nWe host our services, serve our customers and support our operations primarily from California-based data centers, which we operate in conjunction with CenturyLink. However, we host our NetSuite OpenAir applications from a Massachusetts-based data center, which we also operate in conjunction with CenturyLink. We also operate some customer and partner accounts along with Release Preview and trial accounts from a Massachusetts-based data center, which we operate in conjunction with CenturyLink. The OrderMotion applications are hosted from a Virginia-based datacenter which we operate in conjunction with RackSpace. The Element Fusion applications are hosted from a datacenter which we operate in conjunction with CenturyLink. The Tribe HR applications are hosted from a Canada-based datacenter which we operate in conjunction with VM Farms. We do not have sole control over the operations of these facilities. These facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, cyber security attacks, terrorist attacks, power losses, telecommunications failures and similar events. The occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in our services. As part of our current disaster recovery arrangements, our customer data in our California-based data center production environment is replicated to a data center operated in conjunction with CenturyLink located on the East coast of the United States. In particular, our California-based data facilities are located in an area known for seismic activity, increasing our susceptibility to the risk that an earthquake could significantly harm the operations of these facilities. Likewise, facilities operated on the East coast of the United States are susceptible to hurricanes, winter storms and other regionally disruptive events. The facilities also could be subject to break-ins, computer viruses, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and other misconduct.\nOur data center facilities providers have no obligations to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to renew our agreements with the facilities providers on commercially reasonable terms, if our agreements with our facility providers are prematurely terminated, or if in the future we add additional data center facility providers, we may experience costs or downtime in connection with the transfer to, or the addition of, new data center facilities.\nAny errors, defects, disruptions or other performance problems with our services could harm our reputation and may damage our customers\u2019 businesses. Interruptions in our services might reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits to customers, subject us to potential liability, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and harm our renewal rates.\nWe may become liable to our customers and lose customers if we have defects or disruptions in our service or if we provide poor service.\nBecause we deliver our application suite as a service, errors or defects in the software applications underlying our service, or a failure of our hosting infrastructure, may make our service unavailable to our customers. We are also reliant on third-party software and infrastructure, including the infrastructure of the Internet, to provide our services. Any failure of or disruption to this software and infrastructure could also make our service unavailable to our customers. Since our customers use our suite to manage critical aspects of their business, any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems with our suite, whether in connection with the day-to-day operation of our suite, upgrades or otherwise, could damage our customers\u2019 businesses. If we have any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems with our suite, customers could elect not to renew, or delay or withhold payment to us, we could lose future sales or customers may make warranty claims against us, which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or costly litigation.\nThe market for cloud-based applications may develop more slowly than we expect.\nOur success will depend, to a large extent, on the willingness of medium-sized businesses to accept cloud-based services for applications that they view as critical to the success of their business. Many companies have invested substantial effort and financial resources to integrate traditional enterprise software into their businesses and may be reluctant or unwilling to switch to a different application or to migrate these applications to cloud-based services. Other factors that may affect market acceptance of our application include:\n\u2022\nthe security capabilities, reliability and availability of cloud-based services;\n\u2022\ncustomer concerns with entrusting a third party to store and manage their data, especially confidential or sensitive data;\n\u2022\nour ability to minimize the time and resources required to implement our suite;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain high levels of customer satisfaction;\n\u2022\nour ability to implement upgrades and other changes to our software without disrupting our service;\n\u2022\nthe level of customization or configuration we offer;\n\u2022\nour ability to provide rapid response time during periods of intense activity on customer websites; and\n\u2022\nthe price, performance and availability of competing products and services.\nThe market for these services may not develop further, or may develop more slowly than we expect, either of which would harm our business.\nIf our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer\u2019s data, we may incur significant liabilities, our service may be perceived as not being secure and customers may curtail or stop using our suite.\nThe services we offer involve the storage of large amounts of our customers\u2019 sensitive and proprietary information. If our security measures are breached as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, and someone disrupts the confidentiality, integrity, or availability our customers\u2019 data, we could incur significant liability to our customers and to individuals or businesses whose information was being stored by our customers, our business may suffer and our reputation will be damaged. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or to sabotage, systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose sales and customers. Such an actual or perceived breach could also cause a significant and rapid decline in our stock price and the value of our convertible senior notes (the \u201cNotes\u201d).\nWe provide service-level commitments to our customers, which could cause us to issue credits for future services if the stated service levels are not met for a given period and could significantly harm our revenue.\nOur customer agreements provide service-level commitments. If we are unable to meet the stated service-level commitments or suffer extended periods of unavailability for our service, we may be contractually obligated to provide these customers with credits for future services. Our revenue could be significantly impacted if we suffer unscheduled downtime that exceeds the allowed downtimes under our agreements with our customers. In light of our historical experience with meeting our service-level commitments, we do not currently have any liabilities on our balance sheet for these commitments. Our service-level commitment to customers is 99.5% uptime per period, excluding scheduled maintenance. The failure to meet this level of service availability may require us to credit qualifying customers for the value of an entire month of their subscription fees, not just the value of the subscription fee for the period of the downtime. As a result, a failure to deliver services for a relatively short duration could cause us to issue these credits to all qualifying customers. Any extended service outages could harm our reputation, revenue and operating results.\nAssertions by a third party that we infringe its intellectual property, whether successful or not, could subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation or expensive licenses.\nThe software and technology industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and by frequent and an increasing amount of litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have from time to time received claims from third parties alleging we are infringing their intellectual property, and as we continue to grow, the possibility of these and other intellectual property rights claims against us may increase. Our technologies or technologies that we license may not be able to withstand any third-party claims that they infringe or otherwise violate intellectual property rights. Furthermore, many of our service agreements require us to indemnify our customers for certain third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which could increase our costs as a result of defending such claims and may require that we pay damages if there were an adverse ruling related to any such claims. These types of claims could harm our relationships with our customers, may deter future customers from subscribing to our services or could expose us to litigation for these claims. Even if we are not a party to any litigation between a customer and a third party, an adverse outcome in any such litigation could make it more difficult for us to defend our intellectual property in any subsequent litigation in which we are a named party.\nAny intellectual property rights claim against us or our customers, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, expensive to litigate or settle and could divert management attention and financial resources. An adverse determination also could prevent us from offering our suite to our customers and may require that we procure or develop substitute services that do not infringe.\nFor any intellectual property rights claim against us or our customers, we may have to pay damages, license fees and/or stop using technology found to be in violation of a third party\u2019s rights. We may have to seek a license for the technology. Such license may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all, and may significantly increase our operating expenses or may require us to restrict our business activities and limit our ability to deliver certain products and services. As a result, we may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and expense and/or cause us to alter our product and service offerings which could negatively affect our business.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights.\nWe rely on a combination of patent, copyright, service mark, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our proprietary rights, all of which provide only limited protection. We have numerous issued US patents and pending US patent applications. We cannot assure you that any patents will issue from our currently pending patent applications in a manner that gives us the protection that we seek, if at all, or that any of our current patents or future patents issued to us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Any of our current patents or patents that may issue in the future from pending or future patent applications may not provide sufficiently broad protection or they may not prove to be enforceable in actions against alleged infringers. Additionally, although we have licensed from other parties proprietary technology covered by patents, we cannot be certain that any such patents will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Also, we cannot assure you that any future service mark or trademark registrations will be issued for pending or future applications or that any registered service marks or trademarks will be enforceable or provide adequate protection of our proprietary rights.\nWe endeavor to enter into agreements with our employees and contractors and agreements with parties with whom we do business to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information. The steps we have taken, however, may not prevent unauthorized use or the reverse engineering of our technology. Moreover, others may independently develop technologies that are competitive to ours or infringe our intellectual property. Enforcement of our intellectual property rights also depends on our successful legal actions against these infringers, but these actions may not be successful, even when our rights have been infringed.\nFurthermore, effective patent, trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our services are available. In addition, the legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights in Internet-related industries are uncertain and still evolving.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate in the future. As a result, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of research analysts or investors, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. A decline in general macroeconomic conditions could adversely affect our customers\u2019 ability or willingness to purchase our application suite, which could adversely affect our operating results or financial outlook. Fluctuations in our quarterly operating annual results or financial outlook may also be due to a number of additional factors, including the risks and uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this report.\nFluctuations in our operating results could cause our stock price to decline rapidly, may lead analysts to change their long-term model for valuing our common stock, may impact our ability to retain or attract key personnel, or may cause other unanticipated issues. If our operating results or financial outlook fall below the expectations of research analysts or investors, the price of our common stock and the market value of the Notes could decline substantially.\nWe believe that our revenue and operating results may vary significantly in the future and that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful. You should not rely on the results of one quarter as an indication of future performance.\nWe have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries.\nOur company has been in existence since 1998, and much of our growth has occurred since 2004, with our revenue increasing from $17.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2004 to $556.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. We have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries. If we do not address these risks successfully, our business may be harmed.\nThe markets in which we compete are intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results may be harmed.\nThe markets for financials/ERP, CRM, Ecommerce, PSA and HCM applications are intensely competitive and rapidly changing with relatively low barriers to entry. With the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect competition to intensify in the future. In addition, pricing pressures and increased competition generally could result in reduced sales, reduced margins or the failure of our service to achieve or maintain more widespread market acceptance. Often we compete to sell our application suite against existing systems that our potential customers have already made significant expenditures to install. Competition in our market is based principally upon service breadth and functionality; service performance, security and reliability; ability to tailor and customize services for a specific company, vertical or industry; ease of use of the service; speed and ease of deployment, integration and configuration; total cost of ownership, including price and implementation and support costs; professional services implementation; and financial resources of the vendor.\nWe face competition from both traditional software vendors and SaaS providers. Our principal competitors include Epicor Software Corporation, Intuit Inc., Microsoft Corporation, Oracle Corporation, SAP, The Sage Group plc and salesforce.com, inc. Many of our actual and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages over us, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories, more varied products and services and larger marketing budgets, as well as substantially greater financial, technical and other resources. In addition, many of our competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases, and have major distribution agreements with consultants, system integrators and resellers. If we are not able to compete effectively, our operating results will be harmed.\nOur brand name and our business may be harmed by aggressive marketing strategies of our competitors.\nBecause of the early stage of development of our markets, we believe that building and maintaining brand recognition and customer goodwill is critical to our success. Our efforts in this area have, on occasion, been complicated by the marketing efforts of our competitors, which may include incomplete, inaccurate and false statements about our company and our services that could harm our business. Our ability to respond to our competitors\u2019 misleading marketing efforts may be limited under certain circumstances by legal prohibitions on permissible public communications by us as a public company.\nIf the prices we charge for our services are unacceptable to our customers, our operating results will be harmed.\nAs the market for our services matures, or as new competitors introduce new products or services that compete with ours, we may be unable to renew our agreements with existing customers or attract new customers at the same price or based on the same pricing model as previously used. As a result, it is possible that competitive dynamics in our market may require us to change our pricing model or reduce our prices, which could harm our revenue, gross margin and operating results.\nIf we are unable to develop new services or sell our services into new markets, our revenue growth will be harmed and we may not be able to achieve profitability.\nOur ability to attract new customers and increase revenue from existing customers will depend in large part on our ability to enhance and improve our existing application suite and to introduce new services and sell into new markets. The success of any enhancement or new service depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of the enhancement or service. Any new service we develop or acquire may not be introduced in a timely or cost-effective manner and may not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenue. Any new markets into which we attempt to sell our application, including new vertical markets and new countries or regions, may not be receptive. If we are unable to successfully develop or acquire new services, enhance our existing services to meet customer requirements or sell our services into new markets, our revenue will not grow as expected and we may not be able to achieve profitability.\nBecause we are a global organization and our long-term success depends, in part, on our ability to expand our sales of our and operations outside of the United States, our business is susceptible to risks associated with international sales and operations.\nWe currently maintain offices outside of the United States and have sales personnel or independent consultants in several countries. Approximately one quarter of our employees are located in an office in the Philippines. We have limited experience operating in foreign jurisdictions and are rapidly building our international operations. Managing a global organization is difficult, time consuming and expensive. Our inexperience in operating our business outside of the United States increases the risk that any international expansion efforts that we may undertake will not be successful. In addition, conducting international operations subjects us to new risks that we have not generally faced in the United States. These risks include:\n\u2022\nlocalization of our services, including translation into foreign languages and adaptation for local practices and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nlack of familiarity with and unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nlonger accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing and staffing international operations;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added tax systems and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022\ndependence on certain third parties, including channel partners with whom we do not have extensive experience;\n\u2022\nthe burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and legal standards;\n\u2022\nincreased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n\u2022\npolitical, social and economic instability abroad, terrorist attacks and security concerns in general; and\n\u2022\nreduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries.\nOperating in international markets also requires significant management attention and financial resources. The investment and additional resources required to establish operations and manage growth in other countries may not produce desired levels of revenue or profitability.\nWe rely on third-party software, including Oracle database software, which may be difficult to replace or could cause errors or failures of our service that could lead to lost customers or harm to our reputation.\nWe rely on software licensed from third parties to offer our service, including database software from Oracle. This software may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Any loss of the right to use any of this software could result in delays in the provisioning of our service until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained and integrated, which could harm our business. Any errors or defects in third-party software could result in errors or a failure of our service which could harm our business.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired and investors\u2019 views of us could be harmed.\nEnsuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Although we have completed the process of documenting, reviewing and improving our internal controls and procedures for compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, there can be no assurances that control deficiencies will not be identified in the future.\nImplementing any additional required changes to our internal controls may distract our officers and employees, entail substantial costs to modify our existing processes and add personnel and take significant time to complete. These changes may not, however, be effective in maintaining the adequacy of our internal controls. Any failure to maintain that adequacy, or as consequent inability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis, could increase our operating costs and harm our business. In addition, investors\u2019 perceptions that our internal controls are inadequate or that we are unable to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis may harm our stock price and make it more difficult for us to effectively market and sell our service to new and existing customers.\nOur business is subject to changing regulations regarding corporate governance and public disclosure that will increase both our costs and the risk of noncompliance.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses associated with compliance with applicable laws, rules, regulations and listing requirements. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, and rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and The New York Stock Exchange, have imposed a variety of compliance requirements on public companies, including requiring changes in corporate governance practices. In addition, the SEC and the U.S. Congress may continue to increase the scope of applicable disclosure and corporate governance-related rules. Our management and other personnel may need to devote a substantial amount of time to the compliance requirements associated with being a public company. Moreover, these laws, rules and regulations have increased and may continue to increase the scope, complexity and cost of our corporate governance, reporting and disclosure practices.\nBecause we recognize subscription revenue over the term of the applicable agreement, the lack of subscription renewals or new service agreements may not be reflected immediately in our operating results.\nThe majority of our quarterly revenue is attributable to service agreements entered into during previous quarters. A decline in new or renewed service agreements in any one quarter will not be fully reflected in our revenue in that quarter but will harm our revenue in future quarters. As a result, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our services in a particular quarter may not be fully reflected in our operating results until future periods. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, because revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term.\nMaterial defects or errors in the software we use to deliver our services could harm our reputation, result in significant costs to us and impair our ability to sell our services.\nThe software applications underlying our services are inherently complex and may contain material defects or errors, particularly when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. We have from time to time found defects in our service, and new errors in our existing service may be detected in the future. Any defects that cause interruptions to the availability of our services could result in:\n\u2022a reduction in sales or delay in market acceptance of our services;\n\u2022sales credits or refunds to our customers;\n\u2022loss of existing customers and difficulty in attracting new customers;\n\u2022diversion of development resources;\n\u2022harm to our reputation; and\n\u2022increased warranty and insurance costs.\nAfter the release of our services, defects or errors may also be identified from time to time by our internal team and by our customers. The costs incurred in correcting any material defects or errors in our services may be substantial and could harm our operating results.\nGovernment regulation of the Internet and Ecommerce is evolving, and unfavorable changes or our failure to comply with regulations could harm our operating results.\nAs Internet commerce continues to evolve, increasing regulation by federal, state or foreign agencies becomes more likely. For example, we believe increased regulation is likely in the area of data privacy, and laws and regulations applying to the solicitation, collection, processing or use of personal or consumer information could affect our customers\u2019 ability to use and share data, potentially reducing demand for financials/ERP, CRM, PSA and Ecommerce solutions and restricting our ability to store, process and share our customers\u2019 data. In addition, taxation of services provided over the Internet or other charges imposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing the Internet may also be imposed. Any regulation imposing greater fees for Internet use or restricting information exchanged over the Internet could result in a decline in the use of the Internet and the viability of Internet-based services, harming our business and operating results.\nPrivacy concerns and laws or other domestic or foreign regulations may reduce the effectiveness of our application suite and harm our business.\nOur customers can use our service to store personal or identifying information regarding their customers and contacts. Federal, state and foreign government bodies and agencies, however, have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information obtained from consumers and other individuals. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such laws and regulations that are applicable to the businesses of our customers may limit the use and adoption of our service and reduce overall demand for it.\nIn addition to government activity, privacy advocacy groups and the technology and other industries are considering various new, additional or different self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us. If the gathering of personal information were to be curtailed, financials/ERP, CRM, Ecommerce, PSA and HCM solutions would be less effective, likely reducing demand for our service and harming our business.\nIf benefits currently available under the Czech Republic government subsidy program are reduced or disallowed, our operational costs could increase.\nAt our product development facility in the Czech Republic, we participate in a government subsidy program for employing local residents. Under the program, the Czech Republic government will reimburse us for certain operating expenses we incur. In the first quarter of 2014, we reached the initial program's reimbursement limit. We then began participating in a second subsidy program, similar in nature to the initial program in the second quarter of 2014. During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, our operational expenses were reduced by approximately $1.5 million, $2.5 million and $2.0 million, respectively, for reimbursements of eligible operating expenses incurred during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and the period from November 2010 to December 31, 2012, respectively. We received approximately $2.2 million , $2.0 million and $1.2 million in payments from the Czech Republic government during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. If the Czech Republic government determines that our expenses are ineligible for reimbursement, our financial condition and operating results may be harmed.\nChanges in financial accounting standards or practices may cause adverse, unexpected financial reporting fluctuations and harm our operating results.\nA change in accounting standards or practices could harm our operating results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective. New accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future. Changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may harm our operating results or the way we conduct our business.\nUnanticipated changes in our effective tax rate could harm our future operating results.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions. Our tax rate is affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, certain non-deductible expenses arising from the requirement to expense stock options and the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, including our ability to utilize our net operating losses. Increases in our effective tax rate could harm our operating results.\nWe may be unable to integrate acquired businesses and technologies successfully or to achieve the expected benefits of such acquisitions. We may acquire or invest in additional companies, which may divert our management\u2019s attention, result in additional dilution to our stockholders and consume resources that are necessary to sustain our business.\nWe have undertaken acquisitions in the past and may continue to evaluate and consider potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions and dispositions of businesses, technologies, services, products and other assets in the future. An acquisition, investment or business relationship may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. In particular, we may encounter difficulties assimilating or integrating the businesses, technologies, products, personnel or operations of the acquired companies, particularly if the key personnel of the acquired company choose not to work for us, the company\u2019s software is not easily adapted to work with ours or we have difficulty retaining the customers of any acquired business due to changes in management or otherwise. Acquisitions may also disrupt our business, divert our resources and require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for development of our business. Moreover, the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, investment or business relationship may not be realized or we may be exposed to unknown liabilities.\nWe may in the future seek to acquire or invest in additional businesses, products, technologies or other assets. We also may enter into relationships with other businesses to expand our service offerings or our ability to provide service in foreign jurisdictions, which could involve preferred or exclusive licenses, additional channels of distribution, discount pricing or investments in other companies. Negotiating these transactions can be time-consuming, difficult and expensive, and our ability to close these transactions may often be subject to approvals that are beyond our control. Consequently, these transactions, even if undertaken and announced, may not close. For one or more of those transactions, we may:\n\u2022issue additional equity securities that would dilute our stockholders;\n\u2022use cash that we may need in the future to operate our business;\n\u2022incur debt on terms unfavorable to us or that we are unable to repay;\n\u2022incur large charges or substantial liabilities;\n\u2022encounter difficulties retaining key employees of the acquired company or integrating diverse software codes or business cultures; and\n\u2022become subject to adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation or deferred compensation charges.\nAny of these risks could harm our business and operating results.\nWe rely on our management team and need additional personnel to grow our business, and the loss of one or more key employees or our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could harm our business.\nOur success and future growth depends to a significant degree on the skills and continued services of our management team. We do not maintain key man insurance on any members of our management team. Meeting our growth plan and our future success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled technical, managerial, sales, marketing and service and support personnel, including members of our management team. Competition for sales, marketing and technology development personnel is particularly intense in the software and technology industries. As a result, we may be unable to successfully attract or retain qualified personnel. Our inability to attract and retain the necessary personnel could harm our business.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock and the Notes\nLawrence J. Ellison or members of his family, and related entities, beneficially own a significant portion of our outstanding shares of common stock, which may limit your ability to influence or control certain of our corporate actions. This concentration of ownership may also reduce the market price of our common stock and the value of the Notes and impair a takeover attempt of us.\nEntities beneficially owned by Lawrence J. Ellison held an aggregate of approximately 41.5% of our common stock as of December 31, 2014. Further, Mr. Ellison, his family members, trusts for their benefit, and related entities together beneficially owned an aggregate of approximately 47.4% of our common stock as of that date. Mr. Ellison is able to exercise control over approval of significant corporate transactions, including a change of control or liquidation. In addition, if the voting restrictions that apply to NetSuite Restricted Holdings LLC, the investment entity to which Mr. Ellison has transferred his shares, lapse or are amended, Mr. Ellison will be able to exercise control over additional corporate matters, including elections of our directors. So long as Mr. Ellison continues to be either an officer or director of Oracle, these voting restrictions cannot be changed without the approval of an independent committee of Oracle\u2019s board of directors. Mr. Ellison\u2019s interests and investment objectives may differ from our other stockholders. Mr. Ellison is also the Chief Technology Officer, a principal stockholder and a director of Oracle Corporation. Oracle supplies us with database and other software on which we rely to provide our service and is also a potential competitor of ours.\nOur Board of Directors adopted resolutions which renounce and provide for a waiver of the corporate opportunity doctrine as it relates to Mr. Ellison. As a result, Mr. Ellison has no fiduciary duty to present corporate opportunities to us. In addition, Mr. Ellison\u2019s significant interest in us could discourage potential acquirers or result in a delay or prevention of a change in control of our company or other significant corporate transactions, even if a transaction of that sort would be beneficial to our other stockholders or in our best interest and, as a result, reduce the market price of our common stock and the value of the Notes.\nVolatility in the market price and trading volume of our common stock and the Notes could adversely impact the trading price of our common stock and the Notes.\nThe stock market in recent years has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of companies. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including in response to the risks described in this section, elsewhere in this report or for reasons unrelated to our operations, such as reports by industry analysts, investor perceptions or negative announcements by our customers, competitors or suppliers regarding their own performance, as well as industry conditions and general financial, economic and political instability. A decrease in the market price of our common stock would likely adversely impact the trading price of the Notes. The market price of our common stock could also be affected by possible sales of our common stock by investors who view the Notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in us and by hedging or arbitrage trading activity that we expect to develop involving our common stock. This trading activity could, in turn, affect the trading prices of our common stock and the Notes.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the Notes or to repurchase the Notes upon a fundamental change, which may affect the trading price of our common stock, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to repurchase the Notes.\nHolders of the Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a repurchase price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, upon conversion of the Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the Notes being converted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of Notes surrendered therefor or Notes being converted, which could harm our reputation and affect the trading price of our common stock.\nIn addition, our ability to repurchase the Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture would constitute a default under the indenture and could harm our reputation and affect the trading price of our common stock. A default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Notes.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Notes, if triggered, may harm our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the Notes is triggered, holders of Notes will be entitled to convert the Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the Notes, is the subject of recent changes that could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nIn May 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which we refer to as FASB, issued FASB Staff Position No. APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash Upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement), which has subsequently been codified as Accounting Standards Codification 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options, which we refer to as ASC 470-20. Under ASC 470-20, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments (such as the Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer's economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the Notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders' equity on our consolidated balance sheet, and the value of the equity component would be treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the Notes. As a result, we will be required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in current periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the Notes to their face amount over the term of the Notes. We will report lower net income in our financial results because ASC 470-20 will require interest to include both the current period's amortization of the debt discount and the instrument's coupon interest, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the Notes.\nIn addition, under certain circumstances, we may apply the treasury stock method with respect to the Notes, the effect of which is that only the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle the conversion spread, if any, are included in the diluted earnings per share calculation. If we are unable to use the treasury stock method, then we would assume issuance of the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle both the principal balance of the Notes and the conversion spread, if any, and our diluted earnings per share would be harmed.\nFuture sales of shares by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline and adversely impact the trading price of the Notes.\nIf our existing stockholders sell or otherwise dispose of, or indicate an intention to sell or dispose of, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline. As of December 31, 2014, we had a total of 77,031,827 shares of our common stock outstanding. Although shares that are held by NetSuite Restricted Holdings LLC are subject to certain restrictions on disposition and a portion of the remaining shares are subject to our Insider Trading Compliance Policy during certain periods of each quarter, substantially all of the shares held by parties other than NetSuite Restricted Holdings LLC, representing 58.5% of our outstanding shares as of December 31, 2014, are freely tradable, subject to our quarterly black-out policy that applies to the shares held by our directors, officers, employees and consultants. If a significant number of these shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nFurther, in the future, we may sell additional shares of our common stock to raise capital. In addition, a substantial number of shares of our common stock are reserved for issuance upon the exercise of stock options, the vesting of restricted stock units and performance share units and performance shares and upon conversion of the Notes. We cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect, if any, that they may have on the market price for our common stock. The issuance and sale of\nsubstantial amounts of common stock, or the perception that such issuances and sales may occur, could adversely affect the trading price of the Notes and the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.\nThe increase in the conversion rate for Notes converted in connection with a make-whole fundamental change may not adequately compensate the holders of the Notes for any lost value of their Notes as a result of such transaction and may cause our existing stockholders to experience additional dilution.\nIf a make-whole fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date, under certain circumstances, we will increase the conversion rate by a number of additional shares of our common stock for Notes converted in connection with such make-whole fundamental change, which may cause our existing stockholders to experience additional dilution. The increase in the conversion rate will be determined based on the date on which the specified corporate transaction becomes effective and the price paid (or deemed to be paid) per share of our common stock in such transaction. The increase in the conversion rate for Notes converted in connection with a make-whole fundamental change may not adequately compensate the holders of the Notes for any lost value of their Notes as a result of such transaction. In addition, if the price of our common stock in the transaction is greater than $275.00 per share or less than $86.00 per share (in each case, subject to adjustment), no additional shares will be added to the conversion rate. Moreover, in no event will the conversion rate per $1,000 principal amount of Notes as a result of this adjustment exceed shares of common stock, subject to adjustment pursuant to the terms of the Notes.\nOur obligation to increase the conversion rate for Notes converted in connection with a make-whole fundamental change could be considered a penalty, in which case the enforceability thereof would be subject to general principles of reasonableness and equitable remedies.\nProvisions in the indenture for the Notes may deter or prevent a business combination that may be favorable to our stockholders.\nIf a fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date of the Notes, holders of the Notes will have the right, at their option, to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes. In addition, if a make-whole fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date of the Notes, we will in some cases be required to increase the conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its Notes in connection with such fundamental change. Furthermore, the indenture for the Notes prohibits us from engaging in certain mergers or acquisitions unless, among other things, the surviving entity assumes our obligations under the Notes. These and other provisions in the indenture could deter or prevent a third party from acquiring us even when the acquisition may be favorable to our stockholders.\nAny adverse rating of the Notes may cause their trading price to fall, which may affect the trading price of our common stock.\nWe do not intend to seek a rating on the Notes. However, if a rating service were to rate the Notes and if such rating service were to lower its rating on the Notes below the rating initially assigned to the Notes or otherwise announces its intention to put the Notes on credit watch, the trading price of the Notes could decline and the trading price of our common stock may be affected.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could delay changes in management or impair a takeover attempt of us and, as a result, reduce the market price of our common stock and the value of the Notes.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition deemed undesirable by our Board of Directors. Our corporate governance documents include provisions:\n\u2022\nauthorizing blank check preferred stock, which could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock;\n\u2022\nlimiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;\n\u2022\nlimiting the ability of our stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings and to take action by written consent in lieu of a meeting;\n\u2022\nrequiring advance notice of stockholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of our stockholders and for nominations of candidates for election to our Board of Directors;\n\u2022\ncontrolling the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of board and stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nproviding the Board of Directors with the express power to postpone previously scheduled annual meetings and to cancel previously scheduled special meetings;\n\u2022\nlimiting the determination of the number of directors on our board and the filling of vacancies or newly created seats on the board to our Board of Directors then in office; and\n\u2022\nproviding that directors may be removed by stockholders only for cause.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation law, which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common\nstock. Under Section 203, our largest stockholder, which is beneficially owned by Lawrence J. Ellison, and our current stockholders associated with members of Mr. Ellison\u2019s family are not subject to the prohibition from engaging in such business combinations.\nAny provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock and the Notes.\nOur failure to raise additional capital or generate the cash flows necessary to expand our operations and invest in our application services could reduce our ability to compete successfully.\nWe may need to raise additional funds, and we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all. If we raise additional equity or convertible debt financing, our stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the per share value of our common stock could decline. If we engage in additional debt financing, we may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness and force us to maintain specified liquidity or other ratios. If we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms, we may not be able to, among other things:\n\u2022develop or enhance our application and services;\n\u2022continue to expand our product development, sales and marketing organizations;\n\u2022acquire complementary technologies, products or businesses;\n\u2022expand operations, in the United States or internationally;\n\u2022hire, train and retain employees; or\n\u2022respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated working capital requirements.", "PERMNO": 92497, "SIC": 7373, "TIC": "N"}
