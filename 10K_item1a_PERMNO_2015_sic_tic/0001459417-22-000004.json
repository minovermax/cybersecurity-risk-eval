Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in the \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisk Factors Summary\nOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those highlighted in this section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K and summarized below. This risk factor summary does not contain all of the information that may be important to you, and you should read the risk factor summary together with the more detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties set forth following this section as well as elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to COVID-19\n\u2022Our business, results of operations, and financial condition have been, and could continue to be, affected by COVID-19.\nRisks Related to Our Business Model\n\u2022We have incurred significant net losses since inception and may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future.\n\u2022Our financial performance depends heavily on our ability to recruit potential students for our offerings, and our ability to do so may be affected by circumstances beyond our control.\n\u2022Our business depends heavily on the adoption by colleges and universities of online delivery of their educational offerings.\n\u2022To launch a new degree program, we typically must incur significant expense in technology and content development, as well as in marketing and sales to identify and attract prospective students, and it may be several years, if ever, before we generate revenue from a new program sufficient to recover our costs.\n\u2022If new offerings do not scale efficiently and in the time frames we expect, our reputation and our revenue will suffer.\n\u2022Our financial performance depends heavily on student retention within our offerings, and factors influencing student retention may be out of our control.\nRisks Related to Our Operations and Our Growth Strategy\n\u2022Our student acquisition efforts depend in large part upon a limited number of third-party advertising platforms.\n\u2022If our security measures or those of our third-party service providers are breached or fail and result in unauthorized disclosure of data, we could lose clients, fail to attract new clients and be exposed to protracted and costly litigation.\n\u2022Disruption to or failures of our platform could reduce client and student satisfaction with our offerings and could harm our reputation.\n\u2022We face competition from established and emerging companies, which could divert clients or students to our competitors, result in pricing pressure and significantly reduce our revenue.\n\u2022If we do not retain our senior management team and key employees, we may not be able to sustain our growth or achieve our business objectives.\nRisks Related to the edX Acquisition and the Combined Company\n\u2022We may experience difficulties in integrating the operations of edX into our business and in realizing the expected benefits of the edX Acquisition.\n\u2022We have incurred substantial transaction and integration expenses related to the edX Acquisition and expect to incur additional integration expenses related to edX that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows.\n\u2022If students do not expand beyond the free offerings available on our platform, our ability to grow our business and improve our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness and Capital Structure\n\u2022Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk and prevent us from meeting our obligations with respect to our indebtedness.\n\u2022Despite current indebtedness levels and existing restrictive covenants, we may still incur additional indebtedness that could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial financial leverage.\n\u2022To service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash, and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.\n\u2022We may be unable to raise the funds necessary to repurchase the Notes for cash following a \u201cfundamental change,\u201d or to pay any cash amounts due upon conversion, and our other indebtedness may limit our ability to repurchase the Notes or pay cash upon their conversion.\n\u2022Conversion of the Notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock.\n\u2022We may need additional capital in the future to pursue our business objectives. Additional capital may not be available on favorable terms, or at all, which could compromise our ability to grow our business.\nRisks Related to Regulation of Our Business and That of Our University Clients\n\u2022Our business model relies on university client institutions complying with federal and state laws and regulations.\n\u2022Our activities are subject to federal and state laws and regulations and other requirements.\n\u2022Activities of the U.S. Congress or DOE could result in adverse legislation or regulatory actions or investigations.\n\u2022Our business model, which depends in part on our ability to receive a share of tuition revenue as payment from our university clients, has been validated by a DOE \u201cdear colleague\u201d letter, but such validation is not codified by statute or regulation and may be subject to change.\n\u2022If we or our subcontractors or agents violate the incentive compensation rule, we could be liable to our university clients for substantial fines, sanctions or other liabilities.\n\u2022Our future growth could be impaired if our university clients fail to obtain timely approval from applicable regulatory agencies to offer new programs, make substantive changes to existing programs or expand their programs into or within certain states.\n\u2022Evolving regulations and legal obligations related to data privacy, data protection and information security and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations, could have an adverse effect on our business.\nRisk Factors\nRisks Related to COVID-19\nOur business, results of operations, and financial condition have been, and could continue to be, affected by COVID-19.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic has caused, and continues to cause, significant disruptions to the flow of the economy, significant volatility and uncertainty in the global financial markets and disruptions to the normal operations of many businesses, including ours. Furthermore, as the COVID-19 pandemic continues, new variants of the virus are emerging and many jurisdictions are seeing a resurgence in COVID-19 cases, resulting in governments and businesses implementing additional measures in the interest of public health. As such, we cannot predict, with any degree of certainty, the ultimate duration and severity of the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken in response to the pandemic on the global economy and our business, or the likelihood or frequency of future resurgences of the COVID-19 pandemic or other similar major public health concerns.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken steps to protect and assist our employees, including implementing remote and flexible work policies, limiting non-essential business travel, postponing, cancelling or converting to virtual-only certain industry, analyst and employee events and implementing a vaccine policy for employees.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, as well as measures undertaken to contain the spread of COVID-19, including the measures we have taken, has caused disruptions to our business, including volatility in demand for our offerings from students and in\nstudent retention rates and fluctuations in marketing costs from period to period. Disruptions and impacts to our business in the future may include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022causing one or more of our university clients to file for bankruptcy protection or shut down;\n\u2022reducing student demand for our offerings;\n\u2022impacting current and prospective university clients\u2019 desire to launch new educational offerings with us;\n\u2022impacting collections of accounts receivable;\n\u2022impacting our ability to facilitate in-program placements for students in clinical graduate programs;\n\u2022impacting student retention rates in our offerings;\n\u2022increasing cyberattacks and security challenges as our employees and those of our clients and third-party service providers work remotely from networks that may be less secure;\n\u2022impacting the efficiency of our marketing activities;\n\u2022creating difficulties or delays in ramping, training and retaining new employees in an effective manner;\n\u2022imposing negative physical and mental health impacts on, and resulting unavailability or reduced productivity of, our key executives or other employees as a result of such employees or their family members contracting the virus, being placed in quarantine or self-isolation, being in jurisdictions where travel or other activities remain restricted, or due to prolonged social isolation or distancing measures;\n\u2022delaying the anticipated launch dates of our offerings;\n\u2022changing our internal controls, policies and procedures due to remote work arrangements, which may result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls in the preparation of our financial reports and resulting increased costs of controls and compliance oversight activities; and\n\u2022harming our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe cannot predict with any certainty whether and to what degree the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and reactions thereto will continue and how our business and results of operation will be impacted as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve or subside. As a result, we expect to face difficulty accurately predicting our internal financial forecasts.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks identified in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. It is not possible for us to predict the duration or magnitude of the adverse results of the outbreak and its effects on our business, results of operations or financial condition at this time, but such effects may be material.\nRisks Related to Our Business Model\nOur limited operating history, and the evolving scope of our offerings, make it difficult to predict our future financial and operating results, and we may not achieve our expected financial and operating results in the future.\nWe were incorporated in 2008 and launched our first graduate program in 2009. In July 2017, we acquired GetSmarter and extended our offerings to include premium online executive education programs and in May 2019, we acquired Trilogy and further extended our offerings to include skills-based boot camps. In November 2021, we acquired substantially all of the assets of edX, which expanded our offerings to include open courses and micro-credentials and added a consumer facing marketplace. As a result of our limited operating history, and the evolving scope of our offerings, our ability to forecast our future operating results, including revenue, cash flows and profitability, is limited and subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties are incorrect or change, or if we do not manage these risks successfully, our operating and financial results may differ materially from our expectations and our business may suffer.\nWe have incurred significant net losses since inception and may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future.\nWe incurred net losses of $194.8 million, $216.5 million and $235.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We will need to generate and sustain increased revenue levels in future periods to become profitable, and, even if we do, we may not be able to maintain or increase our profitability. We expect to continue to expend substantial financial and other resources on technology and production efforts to support a growing number of offerings and our marketing and sales efforts to drive the acquisition of potential students. Our efforts to grow our business may be more costly than we expect, and we may not be able to increase our revenue enough to offset our operating expenses. If we are forced to reduce our expenses, our growth strategy could be compromised. We may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown events. As a result, we may be unable to achieve and maintain profitability, and the value of our company and our common stock could decline significantly.\nOur financial performance depends heavily on our ability to recruit potential students for our offerings, and our ability to do so may be affected by circumstances beyond our control.\nBuilding awareness of our offerings is critical to our ability to recruit prospective students for our university clients\u2019 offerings and generate revenue. A substantial portion of our expenses is attributable to marketing and sales efforts dedicated to attracting potential students to our offerings. Because we generate revenue based on a portion of the tuition and fees that students pay, it is critical to our success that we identify prospective students for our offerings in a cost-effective manner, and that enrolled students remain active in our offerings until graduation or completion.\nWe have experienced, and may in the future experience, fluctuations in our student enrollments based on a variety of factors. For example, student enrollments have declined, and may decline in the future, due to our university clients changing their admissions standards. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to significant fluctuations in student enrollment across our offerings and we are unable to predict the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on student enrollments in the future.\nThe following factors, many of which are largely outside of our control, may prevent us from successfully driving and maintaining student enrollment in our offerings in a cost-effective manner or at all, which would adversely affect our revenue and ability to achieve profitability:\n\u2022Negative perceptions about online learning programs. Online offerings that we or our competitors provide may not be successful or operate efficiently, and new entrants to the market also may not perform well. Such underperformance could create the perception that online offerings in general are not an effective way to educate students, whether or not our offerings achieve satisfactory performance.\n\u2022Unsuccessful marketing efforts. We invest substantial resources in developing and implementing data-driven marketing strategies that focus on identifying the right potential student at the right time. These marketing efforts make substantial use of search engine optimization, paid search, social media and custom website development and deployment and we rely on a small number of internet search engines and marketing partners. The effectiveness and cost of our marketing efforts has varied over time and from offering to offering based on economic conditions, competition, advertising prices, offerings type, university client reputation and other factors.\n\u2022Damage to university client reputation. Because we often use a university client\u2019s brand in connection with our marketing efforts for their offerings, our university clients\u2019 reputations are critical to our ability to enroll students. Many factors affecting our university clients\u2019 reputations are beyond our control, including ranking among nonprofit educational institutions, internal university matters, changes in university leadership positions and other matters that impact the public perception of our university clients.\n\u2022Lack of interest in an offering. We may encounter difficulties attracting students for offerings that are not highly desired or that are relatively new within their fields. Macroeconomic conditions beyond our control may diminish interest in employment in a field, which could contribute to a lack of interest in offerings related to that field.\n\u2022Reduced support from our university clients. Our ability to grow our revenue from a particular offering depends on the growth of enrollment in that offering. Our university clients could limit enrollment in certain offerings, cease providing the offerings altogether or significantly curtail or inhibit our ability to promote their offerings, any of which would negatively impact our revenue.\n\u2022Our lack of control over our university clients\u2019 admissions standards and admissions decisions for degree programs. Even if we identify prospective students for a degree program, there is no guarantee that our university clients will admit these students to that program. Our university clients retain complete discretion over setting admissions standards and making admissions decisions, and university clients may change admissions standards or inconsistently apply admissions standards.\n\u2022Inability to maintain sufficient high-quality content from our partners. Our success depends on our ability to provide students with high-quality learning experiences. For certain of our offerings, including our degree programs, while our clients are primarily responsible for curriculum development our learning design and development experts collaborate with faculty to ensure the final course content is engaging and digestible in an online format. For other offerings, including our open course and micro-credential offerings, our clients are solely responsible for curriculum development and we provide limited self-help resources. If the course content in our offerings is not high-quality and students are dissatisfied with their experience in an offering on our platform or do not find the content of our offerings appealing, they may stop accessing our content. In turn, if clients perceive that our platform lacks an adequate learner audience, clients may be less willing to provide content to offer on our platform, and the experience of students could be further negatively impacted.\n\u2022Inability of students to secure funding. Like on-campus college and university students, many of the students in our university clients\u2019 offerings, in particular degree programs and boot camps, rely on the availability of third-party financing to pay for tuition and other costs of their education. This may include federal or private student loans, scholarships and grants, or benefits or reimbursement provided by an employer. Any developments that reduce the availability or increase the cost of financial aid for higher education generally, or for our university clients\u2019 offerings, could impair students\u2019 abilities to meet their financial obligations and could negatively impact future enrollment in our offerings.\n\u2022General economic conditions. Student enrollment in our offerings may be affected by changes in global economic conditions, including changes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. An improvement in economic conditions and, in particular, an improvement in the economic conditions in the U.S. and the U.S. unemployment rate, may reduce demand among potential students for educational services, as they may find adequate employment without additional education. Conversely, a worsening of economic and employment conditions may reduce the willingness of employers to sponsor educational opportunities for their employees or discourage existing or potential students from pursuing additional education due to a perception that there are insufficient job opportunities, increased economic uncertainty or other factors.\nOur business depends heavily on the adoption by colleges and universities of online delivery of their educational offerings. If we fail to attract new university clients, or if new leadership at existing university clients does not have an interest in continuing or expanding online delivery of their educational offerings, our revenue growth and profitability may suffer.\nThe success of our business depends in large part on our ability to enter into agreements with additional nonprofit colleges and universities to provide their offerings online. In particular, to engage new university clients, we need to convince potential university clients, many of which have been educating students only in on-campus programs for hundreds of years, to invest significant time and resources to introduce a new teaching modality. The delivery of online education at leading nonprofit colleges and universities is evolving, but many administrators and faculty members continue to have concern regarding the perceived loss of control over the education process that might result from offering content online, as well as skepticism regarding the ability of colleges and universities to provide high-quality education online that maintains the standards they set for their on-campus programs. It may be difficult to overcome this resistance, and online offering of the kind we develop with our university clients may not achieve significant market acceptance. In addition, our university clients have regular turnover in their leadership positions, and there is no guarantee that any new leader will have an interest in continuing or expanding online delivery of the university\u2019s educational offerings. If new leaders at our university clients do not embrace online delivery of educational offerings, we may not be able to add additional offerings with the university client and the university client may attempt to terminate or may not renew their relationship with us.\nThe market for our offerings may be limited based on the types of nonprofit colleges and universities we target and due to exclusivity provisions in certain of our contracts with university clients. We have agreed to incur, and we may incur in the future, costs to terminate some or all of the exclusivity obligations in certain of our university client contracts.\nCertain of our contracts with our university clients limit our ability to enable competitive offerings with other schools. In our Degree Program Segment, we have determined that enabling some of these contractually prohibited competitive programs may be part of our business strategy. We have in the past agreed and may in the future agree with certain university clients to do some or all of the following to reduce or eliminate certain exclusivity obligations: make fixed and contingent cash payments over time, reduce our revenue share over time, and/or make minimum investments in marketing under certain conditions.\nIn addition, in order to maintain good relations with our university clients, we may decide not to approach certain institutions that our university clients regard as their direct competitors to offer similar programs or courses, even if we are allowed to do so under our contracts. A limited number of our contracts with our university clients include provisions that may result in pricing adjustment in limited circumstances. If we need to incur contingent costs in connection with enabling\ncompetitive offerings or if we determine not to approach certain institutions, or if we have to adjust our pricing provisions, our ability to grow our business and achieve profitability would be impaired.\nTo launch a new degree program, we generally incur significant expense in technology and content development, as well as in marketing and sales to identify and attract prospective students, and it may be several years, if ever, before we generate revenue from a new program sufficient to recover our costs.\nTo launch a new degree program, we generally integrate components of our platform with the various student information and other operating systems our university clients use to manage functions within their institutions. In addition, for these degree programs, our content development staff works closely with the university client\u2019s faculty members to produce engaging online coursework and content, and we must commence student acquisition activities. This process is time-consuming and costly and, under our agreements with our university clients, we are primarily responsible for the significant costs of this effort for most of our degree programs, even before we generate any revenue and there is no guarantee we will ever recoup these costs.\nIn exchange for the upfront investments we make in our university clients\u2019 degree programs, our university client agreements generally provide that we receive a fixed percentage of the tuition that the university clients receive from the students enrolled in their degree programs. We only begin to recover these upfront costs once students are enrolled and our university clients begin billing students for tuition and fees. The time that it takes for us to recover our investment in a new degree program depends on a variety of factors, primarily our content development costs, student acquisition costs, the rate of growth in student enrollment in the program, and the tuition of the program. We estimate that, on average, it takes approximately three years after signing an agreement with a university client to fully recover our investment in that university client\u2019s new degree program. Because of the lengthy period required to recoup our investment in these new degree programs, unexpected developments beyond our control could occur that result in the university client ceasing or significantly curtailing a degree program before we are able to fully recoup our investment. As a result, we may ultimately be unable to recover the full investment that we make in a new degree program or achieve our expected level of profitability for the degree program.\nIf new offerings do not scale efficiently and in the time frames we expect, our reputation and our revenue will suffer.\nOur continued growth and ability to achieve profitability depends on our and our university clients\u2019 ability to successfully scale newly launched offerings. Our ability to scale new offerings in the time frame we expect has varied over time and from offering to offering. If we are not successful in recruiting potential students for our offerings, it would adversely impact our ability to generate revenue, and our university clients and the students in their offerings could lose confidence in the knowledge and capability of our employees. If we cannot quickly and efficiently scale our technology to handle growing student enrollment and new offerings, our university clients\u2019 and their students\u2019 experiences may suffer, which could damage our reputation among colleges and universities and their faculty and students and impact our ability to acquire new university clients.\nIn addition, in our Degree Program Segment, if our university clients cannot quickly develop the infrastructure and hire sufficient faculty and administrators to handle growing student enrollments, our university clients\u2019 and their students\u2019 experiences with our platform may suffer, which could damage our reputation among colleges and universities and their faculty and students.\nOur ability to efficiently scale new offerings will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022satisfy existing students in, and attract and enroll new students for, our offerings;\n\u2022assist our university clients in recruiting qualified faculty to support their expanding enrollments;\n\u2022assist our university clients in developing and producing an increased volume of course content;\n\u2022successfully introduce new features and enhancements and maintain a high level of functionality in our platform; and\n\u2022deliver high-quality support to our university clients and their faculty and students.\nIf student enrollment in our offerings does not increase, if we are unable to launch new offerings in a cost-effective manner or if we are otherwise unable to manage new offerings effectively, our ability to grow our business and achieve profitability would be impaired, and the quality of our platform and the satisfaction of our university clients and their students could suffer.\nOur financial performance depends heavily on student retention within our offerings, and factors influencing student retention may be out of our control.\nOnce a student is enrolled in an offering, we and our university client must retain the student over the life of the offering to generate ongoing revenue. Our strategy involves offering high-quality support to students enrolled in these offerings to support their retention. If we are unable to help students quickly resolve any educational, technological or logistical issues they encounter, otherwise provide effective ongoing support to students or deliver high-quality, engaging educational content, students may withdraw from the offering, which would negatively impact our revenue.\nIn addition, student retention could be compromised by the following factors, many of which are largely outside of our control:\n\u2022Lack of support from faculty members in our university clients\u2019 degree programs. It takes a significant time commitment and dedication from our university clients\u2019 faculty members to work with us to develop or to independently develop course content for their degree programs and other courses designed for an online learning environment. Our university clients\u2019 faculty may be unfamiliar with the development and production process, may not understand the time commitment involved, or may otherwise be resistant to changing the ways in which they present the same content in an on-campus class. Our ability to maintain high student retention will depend in part on our ability to convince our university clients\u2019 faculty of the value in the time and effort they will spend developing the course content. Lack of support from faculty could cause the quality of our degree programs to decline, which could contribute to decreased student satisfaction and retention in our Degree Program Segment.\n\u2022Student dissatisfaction. Enrolled students may drop out of our offerings based on their individual perceptions of the value they are getting from the offering. For example, we may face retention challenges as a result of students\u2019 dissatisfaction with our university clients\u2019 faculty, changing views of the value of our offerings and perceptions of employment prospects following completion of the offering.\n\u2022Personal factors. Personal factors, such as ability to continue to pay tuition, ability to meet the rigorous demands of the offering, and lack of time to continue classes, all of which are generally beyond our control, may impact a student\u2019s willingness and ability to stay enrolled in an offering.\nIf student retention is compromised by any of these factors, it could significantly reduce the revenue that we generate from our offerings, which would negatively impact our return on investment for the particular offering and could compromise our ability to grow our business and achieve profitability.\nThe loss, or material underperformance, of any one of our offerings could harm our reputation, which could in turn affect our future revenue growth.\nWe rely on our reputation for delivering high-quality online degree programs and alternative credential offerings and recommendations from existing university clients to attract potential new university clients. Therefore, the loss of any single offering, or the failure of any university client to renew its agreement with us upon expiration, could harm our reputation and impair our ability to pursue our growth strategy and ultimately to become profitable.\nThe recent, significant decline in the market price of our common stock could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial position.\nOur goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually, as of October 1, and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below carrying value. We experienced a significant decline in the market price of our common stock subsequent to February 9, 2022 and management is evaluating whether this decline represents a triggering event for assessing the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset balances for impairment in the first quarter of 2022. There is the potential for a non-cash charge in the first quarter of 2022 to recognize impairment losses on some or all of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. If it is determined that an impairment loss should be recognized on goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets, our business, results of operations, and financial position could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Operations and Our Growth Strategy\nOur student acquisition efforts depend in large part upon a limited number of third-party advertising platforms.\nOur marketing efforts make substantial use of paid search, social media, search engine optimization and custom website development and deployment and we rely on advertising through a limited number of third-party advertising platforms such as Google, Meta Platforms and LinkedIn, to direct traffic to, and recruit new students for, our offerings. Changes in the way these platforms operate - whether due to changes in law, changes in the practices of mobile operating system providers, or otherwise - or changes in their advertising prices, data use practices, or other terms have impacted the cost and efficiency of our student acquisition efforts in the past and could in the future make marketing our offerings more expensive, or more difficult. In addition, the elimination of a particular medium or platform on which we advertise, could limit our ability to direct traffic to our offerings and recruit new students on a cost-effective basis, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf internet search engines\u2019 methodologies are modified, our search engine optimization capability in connection with our student recruiting efforts could be harmed.\nOur search engine optimization capability in connection with our student acquisition efforts substantially depends on various internet search engines, such as Google, to direct a significant amount of traffic to websites related to our offerings. Our ability to influence the number of visitors directed to these websites through search engines is not entirely within our control. For example, search engines frequently revise their algorithms in an attempt to optimize their search result listings. In this respect, we have experienced fluctuations in our search result listings and website traffic based on changes to search engine algorithms, and future algorithm changes by Google or any other search engines could cause the websites for our offerings to receive less favorable placements, which could reduce the number of prospective students who visit these websites and impact our ability to effectively utilize search engine optimization as part of our student acquisition strategies in the long-term. Further, if our competitors\u2019 search engine optimization efforts are more successful than ours, fewer prospective students may be directed to our websites.\nIn October 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice brought an antitrust lawsuit against Google claiming that Google improperly uses its monopoly over internet search to impede competition and harm consumers. We cannot predict the impact that this lawsuit may have on advertising costs or Google\u2019s future operations. Any reduction in the number of prospective students directed to our websites could negatively affect our ability to generate prospective students, and ultimately revenue, through our student acquisition activities.\nIf our security measures or those of our third-party service providers are breached or fail and result in unauthorized disclosure of data, we could lose clients, fail to attract new clients and be exposed to protracted and costly litigation.\nOur platforms and computer systems store and transmit proprietary and confidential client, student, and company information, which may include personal information of students, prospective students, faculty and employees, that are subject to stringent legal and regulatory obligations. As a technology company, we have faced and continue to face an increasing number of threats to our platforms and computer systems, including unauthorized activity and access, system viruses, worms, malicious code, denial of service attacks, phishing attacks, ransomware attacks, social engineering attacks, and organized cyberattacks, any of which could breach our security and create a data exfiltration condition and/or disrupt our platform and our clients\u2019 offerings. The techniques used by computer hackers and cyber criminals to obtain unauthorized access to data or to sabotage computer systems are growing in sophistication, change frequently and generally are not detected until after an incident has occurred. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, an increasing number of cybersecurity threats to our platform and computer systems and to the systems of our third-party service providers and our efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our platform, and the cybersecurity measures taken by our third-party service providers may be unable to anticipate, detect or prevent all attempts to compromise our systems. While there can be no assurances of effectiveness, we have implemented certain safeguards and processes to thwart hackers, and all related activity, and protect the data in our platforms and computer systems. If our, or our third-party service providers\u2019, security measures are breached or fail as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, it could result in the loss or misuse of proprietary and confidential university, student (including prospective student), employee or company information, which could subject us to material liability, or materially interrupt our business, potentially over an extended period of time. Any such event could harm our reputation, adversely affect our ability to attract new clients and students, cause existing clients to scale back their offerings or elect not to renew their agreements, cause prospective students not to enroll or existing students to not stay enrolled in our offerings, or subject us to third-party lawsuits, regulatory fines or other action or liability. Further, any reputational damage resulting from breach of our security measures could create distrust of our company by prospective clients or students. In addition, our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover losses associated with such events, and in any case, such insurance may not cover all costs, expenses or losses we could incur to respond to and remediate a security breach. As a result,\nwe may be required to expend significant additional resources to protect against the threat of these disruptions and security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such disruptions or breaches.\nData protection laws in jurisdictions around the world require companies and institutions to notify impacted individuals of data breach incidents, usually in writing. Under the terms of our contracts with our university clients, we would be responsible for the costs of investigating and disclosing data breaches to the university clients\u2019 students, if required by law. In addition to costs associated with investigating and fully disclosing a data breach, we could be subject to substantial monetary fines or private claims by affected parties and our reputation would likely be harmed.\nDisruption to or failures of our platform could reduce university client and student satisfaction with our offerings and could harm our reputation.\nThe performance and reliability of our platform is critical to our operations, reputation and ability to attract new university clients, as well as our student acquisition and retention efforts. Our university clients rely on our platform to provide their offerings online, and students access our platform on a frequent basis as an important part of their educational experience. Because our platform is complex and incorporates a variety of hardware and proprietary and third-party software, our platform may have errors or defects that could result in unanticipated downtime for our university clients and students. Web- and mobile- based applications frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released, and we have from time to time found errors and defects in our technology and new errors and defects may be detected in the future. In addition, we have experienced and may in the future experience temporary system interruptions to our platform for a variety of reasons, including network failures, power failures, problems with third-party firmware and software updates, as well as an overwhelming number of users trying to access our platform. Any errors, defects, disruptions or other performance problems with our platform could damage our or our university clients\u2019 reputations, decrease student satisfaction and retention and impact our ability to attract new students and university clients. If any of these problems occur, our university clients could attempt to terminate their agreements with us or make indemnification or other claims against us. In addition, sustained or recurring disruptions in our platform could adversely affect our and our university clients\u2019 compliance with applicable regulations and accrediting body standards.\nWe rely upon Amazon Web Services to host certain aspects of our platform and any disruption of or interference with our use of Amazon Web Services could impair our ability to deliver our platform to clients and students, resulting in client and student dissatisfaction, damage to our reputation, and harm to our business.\nOur online learning platform and certain of our other technology and services are hosted on data centers provided by Amazon Web Services, or AWS. Given this, along with the fact that we cannot easily switch our AWS operations to another cloud provider, any disruption of, or interference with our use of, AWS would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted. AWS may terminate its agreement with us upon 30 days\u2019 notice. Additionally, AWS has the right to terminate the agreement immediately with notice to us in certain scenarios, such as if AWS believes providing the services could create a substantial economic or technical burden or material security risk for AWS, or in order to comply with the law or requests of governmental entities. If any of our arrangements with AWS is terminated, we could experience interruptions in our platform as well as delays and additional expenses in arranging new facilities and services.\nOur operations depend, in part, on AWS\u2019s abilities to protect their data center hosting facilities against damage or interruption from natural disasters, power or telecommunications failures, criminal acts and similar events. The occurrence of spikes in usage volume, a natural disaster, an act of terrorism, vandalism or sabotage, a decision to close a facility without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problems at a facility could result in lengthy interruptions in the availability of our platform, which would result in harm to our business. In the event of a system failure, the backup systems and disaster recovery services provided by AWS may be insufficient or fail. Also, in the event of damage or interruption, our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that we may incur. These factors in turn could further reduce our revenue, subject us to liability or cause our clients to fail to renew or terminate their contracts, any of which could harm our business.\nOur internal information technology systems are critical to our business. System integration and implementation issues could disrupt our operations, which could have a material adverse impact on our business or result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls.\nWe rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems, including systems for billing, human resources, enterprise resource planning, and customer relationship management. As our business has grown in size and complexity, the growth has placed, and will continue to place, significant demands on our internal information technology systems. To effectively manage this growth, we must commit significant financial resources and personnel to maintain and enhance existing systems and develop or acquire new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in our business and information-processing technology as well as evolving industry, regulatory, and accounting standards. If the information we rely upon to run our businesses is determined to be inaccurate or unreliable, or if we fail to properly maintain or enhance our internal information technology systems, we could have operational disruptions, significant deficiencies, or material weaknesses in our internal controls, incur increased operating and administrative expenses, lose our ability to produce timely and accurate financial reports, or suffer other adverse consequences\nIf the mobile solutions available to our students and clients are not effective, the use of our platform could decline.\nStudents have been increasingly accessing our offerings and marketplace on mobile devices through our mobile applications in recent years. The smaller screen size and reduced functionality associated with some mobile devices may make the use of our platform more difficult or our clients may believe that online learning through such mobile devices is not effective. If we are not able to provide our clients with the functionality to deliver a rewarding experience on mobile devices, our ability to attract students to our offerings may be harmed and, consequently, our business may suffer.\nAs new mobile devices and mobile features are released, we may encounter problems in developing or supporting apps for them. In addition, supporting new devices and mobile device operating systems may require substantial time and resources.\nThe success of our mobile apps could also be harmed by factors outside our control, such as:\n\u2022actions taken by mobile app distributors;\n\u2022unfavorable treatment received by our mobile apps, especially as compared to competing apps, such as the placement of our mobile apps in a mobile app download store;\n\u2022increased costs in the distribution and use of our mobile apps; or\n\u2022changes in mobile operating systems, such as iOS and Android, that degrade functionality of our mobile website or mobile apps or that give preferential treatment to competitive offerings.\nIf our clients or students encounter difficulty accessing or using, or if they choose not to use, our mobile platform, our growth prospects and our business may be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, the success of our business model will be compromised.\nWe have experienced rapid growth in a relatively short period of time, which has placed, and will continue to place, a significant strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure and may require us to expand personnel on certain teams, as well as our facilities and infrastructure. We will also be required to refine our operational, financial and management controls and reporting systems and procedures. If we fail to manage the growth of our business efficiently, our costs and expenses may increase more than we plan and we may not successfully expand our university client base, enhance our platform, develop new offerings with new and existing university clients, attract a sufficient number of students in a cost-effective manner, satisfy the requirements of our existing university clients, respond to competitive challenges or otherwise execute our business plan. Accordingly, our historical revenue growth rate may not continue in the future.\nOur ability to manage any significant growth of our business effectively will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022effectively recruit, integrate, train and motivate any new employees, while retaining existing employees;\n\u2022maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture and effectively execute our business plan;\n\u2022implement systems enhancements and continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls;\n\u2022protect and further develop our strategic assets, including our intellectual property rights; and\n\u2022make sound business decisions in light of the scrutiny associated with operating as a public company.\nThese activities will require significant capital expenditures and place significant demands on our management and our operational and financial infrastructure.\nWe may not be able to effectively manage any future growth in a cost-effective or timely manner, or at all, which could negatively affect the quality of our platform, our reputation, results of operations and overall business.\nWe may expand by acquiring or investing in other companies or technologies, which may divert our management\u2019s attention, result in dilution to our shareholders and consume resources that are necessary to sustain our business.\nWe have in the past acquired and may in the future acquire complementary products, services, technologies or businesses. Negotiating these transactions can be time-consuming, difficult and expensive, and our ability to complete these transactions may be subject to conditions or approvals that are beyond our control. In addition, we may not be able to identify desirable acquisition targets, may incorrectly estimate the value of an acquisition target or may not be successful in entering into an agreement with any particular target. Consequently, these transactions, even if undertaken and announced, may not close.\nAn acquisition, investment, or new business relationship may result in unforeseen operating difficulties, expenditures and integration challenges including the following:\n\u2022diversion of management\u2019s attention from ongoing business concerns and performance;\n\u2022managing a larger combined company;\n\u2022maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees;\n\u2022retaining existing business and operational relationships and attracting new business and operational relationships;\n\u2022consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations and inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n\u2022coordinating geographically separate organizations;\n\u2022unanticipated issues in integrating information technology, communications and other systems;\n\u2022undetected errors or unauthorized use of a third party\u2019s code in the products of the acquired companies or in the technology acquired;\n\u2022breaches of our cybersecurity measures if there are cybersecurity issues we are not aware of at the time of the acquisition;\n\u2022entry into highly competitive markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors have stronger market positions;\n\u2022exposure to unknown liabilities, including claims and disputes by third parties against the companies we acquire.\nMany of these factors will be outside of the combined company\u2019s control and any one of them could result in delays, increased costs, decreased revenue and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy, which could materially affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we experience difficulties with the integration process following an acquisition, the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. Moreover, the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, investment, or business relationship may not be realized.\nIn addition, in connection with an acquisition, investment or new business relationship we may:\n\u2022issue additional equity securities that would dilute current shareholders;\n\u2022use cash that we may need in the future to operate our business;\n\u2022incur debt on terms unfavorable to us or that we are unable to repay or that may place burdensome restrictions on our operations;\n\u2022incur large charges or substantial liabilities; or\n\u2022become subject to adverse tax consequences.\nAny of these outcomes could harm our business and operating results. In addition, a significant portion of the purchase price of companies we have acquired and may acquire in the future may be allocated to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which must be assessed for impairment at least annually. If our acquisitions do not ultimately yield expected returns, we may be required to make changes to our operating results based on our impairment assessment process. For example, an interim goodwill impairment test performed in 2019 indicated that the carrying value of Trilogy exceeded its fair value. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge of $70.4 million on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2021, our goodwill balance was $834.5 million and indefinite-lived intangible asset was $255.0 million, a significant portion of which relate to the edX Acquisition.\nWe face competition from established and emerging companies, which could divert clients or students to our competitors, result in pricing pressure and significantly reduce our revenue.\nWe expect that the online learning market will continue to expand and that the number of degree and non-degree offerings available online will proliferate.\nParticularly in the Degree Program Segment, the number of new competitive entrants into the online learning market has expanded rapidly in recent years. As the number of online degree programs expands, we face increasing competition to enroll students in our offerings. This expansion has also resulted in an increase in the number of regional online degree program offerings for potential students. In addition to making enrollment decisions based on factors such as program quality and university brand strength, we have observed potential students giving preference to universities located in their region, which has further impacted the competitive landscape in our Degree Program Segment.\nIn our Alternative Credential Segment, which has a lower barrier to entry, we face increasing competition from other providers of massive open online courses, which directly compete with our open course offerings, but have also expanded their offerings to include certificate offerings, nano-degrees and similar non-degree alternatives. We also face competition from companies that provide corporate training programs and online courses taught outside the university environment (e.g., by experts in various fields). Many of these competitors can also leverage the strength of their consumer facing brands to attract students to their offerings at a low cost.\nWe expect existing competitors and new entrants to the online learning market to revise and improve their business models constantly in response to challenges from competing businesses, including ours. If these or other market participants introduce new or improved delivery of online education and technology-enabled services that we cannot match or exceed in a timely or cost-effective manner, our ability to grow our revenue and achieve profitability could be compromised.\nSome of our competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater resources than we do. Increased competition may result in pricing pressure for us in terms of the percentage of tuition and fees we are able to negotiate to receive. The competitive landscape may also result in longer and more complex sales cycles with a prospective university client or a decrease in our market share among select nonprofit colleges and universities seeking to offer online educational offerings, any of which could negatively affect our revenue and future operating results and our ability to grow our business.\nA number of competitive factors could cause us to lose potential client and student opportunities or force us to offer our platform on less favorable economic terms, including:\n\u2022competitors may develop service offerings that our potential clients or students find to be more compelling than ours;\n\u2022competitors may adopt more aggressive pricing policies and offer more attractive sales terms, adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in client and student requirements, and devote greater resources to the acquisition of students than we can;\n\u2022current and potential competitors may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to enhance their products and expand their markets, and our industry is likely to see an increasing number of new entrants and increased consolidation. Accordingly, new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share; and\n\u2022colleges and universities may choose to continue using or to develop their own online learning solutions in-house, rather than pay for our platform.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. In addition, competition may intensify as our competitors raise additional capital and as established companies in other market segments or geographic markets expand into our market segments or geographic markets. If we cannot compete successfully against our competitors, our ability to grow our business and achieve profitability could be impaired.\nIf for-profit postsecondary institutions, which offer online education alternatives different from ours, or online program management providers perform poorly or continue to attract negative publicity, it could tarnish the reputation of online education as a whole, which could impair our ability to grow our business.\nFor-profit postsecondary institutions, many of which provide course offerings predominantly online, remain under intense regulatory and other scrutiny, which has led to media attention that has portrayed that sector in an unflattering light. Some for-profit online school operators have been subject to governmental investigations alleging the misuse of public funds, financial irregularities, exaggerated promises to students, and failure to achieve positive outcomes for students, including the inability to obtain employment in their fields. These allegations have attracted significant adverse media coverage and have prompted ongoing legislative hearings and actions as well as regulatory responses at both the state and federal level. These investigations have focused on specific companies and individuals, and the entire industry in the case of marketing and recruiting practices by for-profit higher education companies. Even though we do not market our platform to for-profit institutions, and have a different business model from them, this negative media attention may nevertheless foster skepticism about online higher education generally and our company specifically. Allegations of abuse of federal financial aid funds and other statutory violations against for-profit higher education companies, even if unfounded, could negatively impact our opportunity to succeed due to increased regulation or decreased demand for our offerings. Our company has been the subject of articles and inquiries by critics of for-profit education models generally, and such critics have advocated for changes in law and regulation at the state and federal level that would be adverse to our business model and have sought information and increased oversight regarding the business practices of online program management companies. Such critics have sometimes compared our business to that of entities that were formally for-profit institutions and that subsequently converted to non-profit status, and the conflation of these newer business models with our own may increase scrutiny of our business by Congress, DOE or other regulatory agencies. Any of these factors could negatively impact our ability to increase our university client base and grow our offerings and our revenue, which would make it difficult to continue to grow our business.\nIf we do not retain our senior management team and key employees, we may not be able to sustain our growth or achieve our business objectives.\nOur future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management team. In this respect, our senior management team is heavily involved in the university client identification and sales process, and their expertise is critical in navigating the complex approval processes of large nonprofit colleges and universities. We do not maintain key-person insurance on any of our employees, including our senior management team. The loss of the services of any individual on our senior management team, or failure to find a suitable successor, could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business and achieve our business goals.\nOur future success also depends heavily on the retention of our marketing and sales, technology and content development and support teams to continue to attract and retain students, thereby generating revenue for us. In particular, our highly-skilled technology and content development employees provide the technical expertise underlying our technology and technology-enabled services that support our university clients\u2019 offerings and the students enrolled in these offerings. We have experienced intense competition for these employees, and we may be unable to attract or retain these key personnel that are critical to our success, resulting in harm to our relationships with university clients, loss of expertise or know-how and unanticipated recruitment and training costs.\nIn addition, as a result of business acquisitions, current and prospective employees of 2U and any acquired company may experience uncertainty about their future roles following the acquisition. If our employees or the employees of any acquired company depart because of issues relating to uncertainty or perceived difficulties of integration, our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition could be adversely impacted.\nWe maintain offices outside of the United States, have international residents that apply to and enroll in our offerings and plan to expand our international business, which exposes us to risks inherent in international operations.\nSince 2017, and more recently as a result of the edX Acquisition, we have significantly increased our international operations, including the number of international applicants and students in our offerings. One element of our growth strategy is to continue expanding our international operations and to continue expanding our global student and client base. Our current international operations and future initiatives will involve a variety of risks that could constrain our operations and compromise our growth prospects, including:\n\u2022the need to localize and adapt online offerings for specific countries, including translation into foreign languages and ensuring that these offerings enable our university clients to comply with local education laws and regulations;\n\u2022difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, including different pricing environments, longer sales cycles, longer accounts receivable payment cycles and collections issues;\n\u2022lack of familiarity with and unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements;\n\u2022challenges inherent in efficiently managing an increased number of employees over large geographic distances, including the need to implement appropriate systems, policies, benefits and compliance programs;\n\u2022new and different sources of competition, and practices which may favor local competitors;\n\u2022weaker protection for intellectual property and other legal rights than in the United States and practical difficulties in enforcing intellectual property and other rights outside of the United States;\n\u2022compliance challenges related to the complexity of multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including labor and employment, tax, education, privacy and data protection, and anti-bribery laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act;\n\u2022increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n\u2022restrictions on the transfer of funds;\n\u2022adverse tax consequences, including liabilities for indirect taxes or the potential for required withholding taxes for our overseas employees;\n\u2022terrorist attacks, public health crises, acts of violence or war and adverse environmental conditions;\n\u2022a country\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic or economic and political measures taken to contain the spread of COVID-19 as well as any resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022unstable regional, economic or political conditions; and\n\u2022fluctuations in currency exchange rates or restrictions on foreign currency and resulting effects on our revenue and expenses.\nOur expansion efforts may not be successful. Our experience with attracting university clients and students in the U.S. may not be relevant to our ability to attract clients and students in other markets. If we invest substantial time and resources to expand our international operations and are unable to attract university clients and students successfully and in a timely manner, our business and operating results will be harmed.\nOur operations in South Africa expose us to risks that could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe have a significant employee base in South Africa. We may incur costs complying with labor laws, rules and regulations in South Africa, including laws that regulate work time, provide for mandatory compensation in the event of termination of employment for operational reasons, and impose monetary penalties for non-compliance with administrative and reporting requirements in respect of affirmative action policies. Our reliance on a workforce in South Africa also exposes us to disruptions in the business, political, and economic environment in that region, as well as natural disasters, public health crises and other environmental conditions. Maintenance of a stable political environment is important to our operations in South Africa, and terrorist attacks and acts of violence or war may directly affect our physical facilities and workforce or contribute to general instability. Our operations in South Africa require us to comply with complex local laws and regulatory requirements and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk. The economy of South Africa in the past has been, and in the future may continue to be, characterized by rates of inflation and interest rates that are substantially higher than those prevailing in the United States, which could increase our South-African-based costs and decrease our operating margins. Our operations in South Africa may also subject us to trade restrictions, exchange control limitations, reduced or inadequate protection for intellectual property rights, security breaches, and other factors that may adversely affect our business. Negative developments in any of these areas could increase our costs of operations or otherwise harm our business.\nWe engage some individuals classified as independent contractors, not employees, and if U.S. or international regulatory authorities mandate that they be classified as employees, our business would be adversely impacted.\nWe engage independent contractors and are subject to U.S. and international regulations and guidelines regarding independent contractor classification. These regulations and guidelines are subject to judicial and agency interpretation, and it could be determined that our current or former independent contractor classifications are inapplicable. Further, if legal standards for classification of independent contractors change, it may be necessary to modify our compensation structure for these personnel, including by paying additional compensation or reimbursing expenses. In addition, if our independent contractors are determined to have been misclassified as independent contractors, we would incur additional exposure under U.S. and international law, workers\u2019 compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, employment and tort laws, including for prior periods, as well as potential liability for employee benefits and tax withholdings. Any of these outcomes could result in\nsubstantial costs to us, could significantly impair our financial condition and our ability to conduct our business as we choose, and could damage our reputation and our ability to attract and retain other personnel.\nWe rely on certain third-party providers of software and services integral to the operations of our business.\nWe rely on software that we license from third parties and services provided by third parties to offer certain components of our technology and services. In addition, we may need to obtain future licenses or services from third parties necessary for the continued provision of our technology and services, which might not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If our agreements with third-party software or services vendors are not renewed or the third-party software or services become obsolete, fail to function properly, are defective or otherwise fail to provide quality service or address our or our clients\u2019 needs, there is no assurance that we would be able to replace the functionality provided by the third-party software or service provider with software or services from alternative providers. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.\nRisks Related to the edX Acquisition and the Combined Company\nWe may experience difficulties in integrating the operations of edX into our business and in realizing the expected benefits of the edX Acquisition.\nThe success of the edX Acquisition depends in part on our ability to realize the anticipated business opportunities from combining the operations of edX with our business in an efficient and effective manner. Following the closing of the edX Acquisition, we are integrating the edX business with our existing business, which is a complex and time-consuming process. Our failure to meet the challenges involved in successfully integrating the operations of edX or to otherwise realize any of the anticipated benefits of the edX Acquisition, including additional cost savings and synergies, could impair our operations. It is possible that this integration and our efforts to realize the expected benefits of the edX Acquisition could result in material challenges, including, without limitation:\n\u2022the disruption of each company\u2019s ongoing businesses, including as a result of diverting management\u2019s attention to integration efforts;\n\u2022unanticipated issues in integrating operations and systems, including administrative and information technology infrastructure and financial reporting and internal control systems;\n\u2022the burden of complying with a wide variety of laws, including additional privacy, marketing and international trade and economic sanctions related laws, some of which did not apply to edX as a non-profit before the closing of the edX Acquisition;\n\u2022managing a larger combined company;\n\u2022maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees;\n\u2022maintaining the reputation and brand of edX, including as a result of the edX business ceasing to be operated by a non-profit entity;\n\u2022the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process or expected synergies;\n\u2022inability to realize the expected operating leverage, marketing efficiencies and other strategic benefits anticipated\n\u2022inability to maintain and grow the edX enterprise business;\n\u2022coordinating geographically separate organizations;\n\u2022tax costs, liabilities or inefficiencies;\n\u2022additional regulatory scrutiny focused on edX or the combined company; and\n\u2022unforeseen expenses associated with the integration of the edX business.\nMany of these factors are outside of our control and any one of them could result in delays, increased costs, decreases in revenues and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy, which could adversely affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the edX Acquisition and could harm our financial performance. The initial anticipated cost savings, synergies and other benefits of the edX Acquisition assume a successful integration of edX\u2019s operations and are based on projections and other assumptions, which are inherently uncertain. If we are unable to successfully or timely integrate the operations of edX with our business, we may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits resulting from the edX Acquisition, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Even if integration is successful,\nanticipated cost savings, synergies and other benefits may not be achieved. If, among other things, we are unable to achieve the anticipated strategic benefits or synergies, or if the integration costs related to the edX Acquisition are greater than expected, the market price of our common stock may decline. The market price of our common stock also may decline if we do not achieve the perceived benefits of the edX Acquisition as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts or if the effect of the edX Acquisition on our financial results is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts.\nWe have incurred substantial transaction and integration expenses related to the edX Acquisition and expect to incur additional integration expenses related to edX that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows.\nWe have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, a number of non-recurring costs associated with the edX Acquisition and associated integration activities. For example, we expect to incur costs related to formulating and implementing integration plans, including facilities and systems consolidation costs and employment-related costs. We continue to assess the magnitude of these costs, and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration process. Any expected efficiencies to offset these costs may not be achieved in the near term, or at all.\nWe do not control and may be unable to predict the future path of the Licensed edX Platform.\nCertain of our offerings are hosted on the open source learner management platform that is owned by the non-profit entity that survived the edX Acquisition (the \u201cLicensed Platform\u201d). We do not own the Licensed Platform and we do not control and may be unable to predict the future path of open source technology development of the Licensed Platform, including the ongoing development of open source components used in the Licensed Platform, which could reduce the appeal of our offerings hosted on the Licensed Platform and damage our reputation. If open source software programmers, many of whom we do not employ, or our own internal programmers do not continue to develop and enhance the Licensed Platform, we may be unable to meet student or university requirements.\nIf students do not expand beyond the free offerings available on our platform, our ability to grow our business and improve our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nMany of our students initially access the free or audit track of the open courses available on our platform. Our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to persuade those students to enroll in the paid certificate track of the open courses available on our platform or in one of our other degree programs, executive education programs, boot camps or micro-credential courses. If students do not expand beyond free offerings, our ability to grow our business may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness and Capital Structure\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk and prevent us from meeting our obligations with respect to our indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $960.3 million of indebtedness on a consolidated basis. See Note 9 in the \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur substantial indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022require a substantial portion of our cash from operating activities to be dedicated to debt service payments and reduce the amount of cash available for working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to certain of our competitors who have less debt;\n\u2022hinder our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions;\n\u2022limit our ability to secure adequate bank financing in the future with reasonable terms and conditions; and\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to, and limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to, a potential downturn in general economic conditions or in one or more of our businesses.\nThe Indenture and the Term Loan Agreement contain, and the agreements governing indebtedness we may incur in the future may contain, affirmative and negative covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our debt.\nIn addition, we may need to amend agreements that use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the rate. On March 5, 2021, the authority that regulates LIBOR announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of one, three- and six-month LIBOR after June 30, 2023. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating such LIBOR periods will be established such that they continue to exist after June 30, 2023. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, has recommended replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR periods with a newly created term index based on the secured overnight financing rate, commonly referred to as \u2018Term SOFR\u2019; provided, that, our Term Loan Agreement, after the cessation of such LIBOR periods, shall use firstly \u2018Term SOFR\u2019 plus a customary market adjustment and if Term SOFR is no longer available, overnight SOFR plus a customary market adjustment. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the United Kingdom, the United States or elsewhere.\nDespite current indebtedness levels and existing restrictive covenants, we may still incur additional indebtedness that could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial financial leverage.\nWe may incur significant additional indebtedness in the future under the agreements governing our indebtedness. We will not be restricted under the terms of the Indenture from incurring additional debt. Although the Term Loan Agreement contains, and any future indebtedness may contain, restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of thresholds, qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Additionally, these restrictions could permit us to incur obligations that, although preferential to our common stock in terms of payment, do not constitute indebtedness.\nFurthermore, any future indebtedness may prohibit or otherwise restrict us from making any cash payments on the conversion or repurchase of the Notes. Our failure to make cash payments upon the conversion or repurchase of the Notes as required under the terms of the Notes would permit holders of the Notes to accelerate our obligations under the Notes. In addition, any future indebtedness that we may incur may contain financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to operate our business, raise capital or make payments under our other indebtedness. If we fail to comply with such covenants or to make payments under our indebtedness when due, then we would be in default under that indebtedness, which could, in turn, result in that indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full.\nThe Term Loan Agreement contains a financial covenant that may limit our operational flexibility.\nIn connection with the edX Acquisition, we entered into the Term Loan Agreement, which requires us to comply with several customary financial and other restrictive covenants, such as maintaining leverage ratios in certain situations, maintaining insurance coverage, and restricting our ability to make certain investments. We are also required to maintain minimum Recurring Revenues (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement) as of the last day of any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters of the Company commencing with fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2021 through the Maturity Date (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement), which may limit our ability to engage in new lines of business, make certain investments, pay dividends, or enter into various transactions.\nThis covenant may limit the flexibility of our operations, and failure to meet this financial covenant could result in a default under the Term Loan Agreement. If such a default were to occur, the lenders would have the right to terminate their commitments to provide loans under the Term Loan Agreement and declare any and all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. In addition, the lenders would have the right to proceed against the collateral in which we granted a first priority security interest to them, which consists of substantially all our assets. If the debt under the Term Loan Agreement were to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash or be able to borrow sufficient funds to refinance the debt or sell sufficient assets to repay the debt, which could immediately materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nTo service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash, and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.\nOur ability to make cash payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend upon our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operating activities or are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, or amounts paid upon conversion of the Notes, or if we fail to comply with the various covenants in the instruments governing our indebtedness and we are unable to obtain waivers from the required lenders or noteholders, we could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness. In the event of such default, the holders of our indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. As a result, we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nWe may be unable to raise the funds necessary to repurchase the Notes for cash following a \u201cfundamental change,\u201d or to pay any cash amounts due upon conversion, and our other indebtedness may limit our ability to repurchase the Notes or pay cash upon their conversion.\nHolders of the Notes may, subject to certain exceptions, require us to repurchase their Notes following a \u201cfundamental change\u201d (as defined in the Indenture) at a cash repurchase price generally equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, upon conversion, we will satisfy part or all of our conversion obligation in cash unless we elect to settle conversions solely in shares of our common stock. We may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to repurchase the Notes or pay the cash amounts due upon conversion. In addition, applicable law, regulatory authorities and the agreements governing our other indebtedness may restrict our ability to repurchase the Notes or pay the cash amounts due upon conversion. Our failure to repurchase Notes or to pay the cash amounts due upon conversion when required will constitute a default under the Indenture. A default under the Indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our other indebtedness, which may result in that other indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full. We may not have sufficient funds to satisfy all amounts due under the other indebtedness and the Notes.\nConversion of the Notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock.\nThe conversion of some or all of the Notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares upon any conversion of the Notes. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Notes could be used to satisfy short positions. The anticipated conversion of the Notes into shares of our common stock could also depress the price of our common stock.\nProvisions in the Notes, Indenture and in the Term Loan Agreement could delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover of us.\nCertain provisions in the Notes and the Indenture could make a third-party attempt to acquire us more difficult or expensive. For example, if a takeover constitutes a \u201cfundamental change\u201d (as defined in the Indenture), then noteholders will have the right to require us to repurchase their Notes for cash. In addition, if a takeover constitutes a \u201cmake-whole fundamental change\u201d (as defined in the Indenture), then we may be required to temporarily increase the conversion rate. In either case, and in other cases, our obligations under the Notes and the Indenture, as well as the Term Loan Agreement, under which a \u201cchange of control\u201d is an event of default resulting in acceleration of all indebtedness thereunder, could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management, including in a transaction that noteholders or holders of our common stock may view as favorable.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the Notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nIn August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued ASU 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contract on an Entity\u2019s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) (\u201cASU 2020-06\u201d), which amends the accounting standards for convertible debt instruments that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion. ASU 2020-06 eliminates requirements to separately account for liability and equity components of such convertible debt instruments and eliminates the ability to use the treasury stock method for calculating diluted earnings per share for convertible instruments whose principal amount may be settled using shares. Instead, ASU 2020-06 requires (i) the entire amount of the security to be presented as a liability on the balance sheet and (ii) application of the if-converted method for calculating diluted earnings per share. Under the if-converted method, diluted earnings per share will generally be calculated assuming that all the Notes were converted solely into shares of common stock at the beginning of the reporting period, unless the result would be anti-dilutive, which could adversely affect our diluted earnings per share. However, if the principal amount of the convertible debt security being converted is required to be paid in cash and only the excess is permitted to be settled in shares, the if-converted method will produce a similar result as the treasury stock method prior to the adoption of ASU 2020-06 for such convertible debt security.\nWe will adopt ASU 2020-06 in the first quarter of 2022, using the modified retrospective basis, effective as of January 1, 2022. Following adoption of this ASU, we will no longer separate the liability and equity components of the Notes on our balance sheet.\nThe capped call transactions may affect the value of our common stock.\nIn connection with the Notes, we entered into capped call transactions with certain option counterparties. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution upon any conversion of the Notes and/or offset any cash\npayments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap.\nThe option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions from time to time (and are likely to do so following any conversion of the Notes, any repurchase of the Notes by us on any fundamental change repurchase date, any redemption date or any other date on which the Notes are retired by us, in each case, if we exercise our option to terminate the relevant portion of the capped call transactions). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, if any such capped call transactions are terminated for any reason, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may unwind their hedge positions with respect to our common stock, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nFurthermore, the option counterparties are financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that any or all of them might default under the capped call transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. Past global economic conditions have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of a number of financial institutions. If an option counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under the capped call transactions with such option counterparty. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, an increase in our exposure will be correlated to an increase in the market price and in the volatility of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by an option counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the option counterparties.\nWe might not be able to utilize a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards due to prior period losses, which, if not utilized, will begin to expire in 2029. Our gross state net operating loss carryforwards are equal to or less than the federal net operating loss carryforwards and expire over various periods based on individual state tax laws. These net operating loss carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities, which could adversely affect our profitability. In addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d which is generally defined as a greater than 50% change, by value, in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. During the three-year period ended December 31, 2016, we determined that such an ownership change occurred. Absent a subsequent ownership change, however, all of our historical net operating losses should be available. Therefore, the occurrence of the ownership change during the three-year period ended December 31, 2016 is not expected to limit our ability to carry forward historical net operating losses before expiration. We may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. If a future ownership change occurs and limits our ability to use our historical net operating loss carryforwards, it would harm our future financial statement results by increasing our future tax obligations. We also have net operating loss carryforwards in South Africa and the United Kingdom and there is no guarantee that entities in these countries will generate enough taxable income to fully utilize them.\nWe may need additional capital in the future to pursue our business objectives. Additional capital may not be available on favorable terms, or at all, which could compromise our ability to grow our business.\nWe may need to raise additional funds to respond to business challenges or opportunities, accelerate our growth, develop new offerings or enhance our platform. Our continued access to sources of liquidity depends on multiple factors, including global economic conditions, the condition of global financial markets, the availability of sufficient amounts of financing and our operating performance, all of which may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. If we seek to raise additional capital, it may not be available on favorable terms or may not be available at all. In addition, under our Term Loan Agreement, we may be restricted from using the net proceeds of financing transactions for our operating objectives. Lack of sufficient capital resources could significantly limit our ability to manage our business and to take advantage of business and strategic opportunities. Any additional capital raised through the sale of equity or debt securities with an equity component would dilute our stock ownership. If adequate additional funds are not available if and when needed, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate material parts of our business strategy.\nRisks Related to Regulation of Our Business and That of Our University Clients\nOur business model relies on university client institutions complying with federal and state laws and regulations.\nHigher education is heavily regulated. All of our university clients in the United States and certain university clients outside of the United States participate in Title IV federal student financial assistance programs under the HEA of 1965, as amended, or HEA, and are subject to extensive regulation by the DOE, as well as various state agencies, licensing boards and accrediting commissions. To participate in the Title IV programs, an institution must receive and maintain authorization by the appropriate state education agencies, be accredited by an accrediting commission recognized by the DOE, and be certified by the DOE as an eligible institution. If a university client participating in Title IV was found to be in non-compliance with any of these laws, regulations, standards or policies, the university client could lose some or all of its access to Title IV program funds, lose the ability to offer certain programs or lose its ability to operate in certain states, any of which could cause our revenue from that university client\u2019s program to decline.\nThe regulations, standards and policies applicable to our university clients change frequently and are often subject to interpretation. Changes in, or new interpretations of, applicable laws, regulations or standards could compromise our university clients\u2019 accreditation, authorization to operate in various states, permissible activities or use of federal funds under Title IV programs. We cannot predict with certainty how the requirements applied by our university clients\u2019 regulators will be interpreted, or whether our university clients will be able to comply with these requirements in the future.\nCertain requirements of Title II and Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act apply to us and our university clients and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1974 applies to our university clients that receive federal funding. Further, in the absence of definitive federal rulemaking, the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1, a set of recommendations and technical standards for making websites accessible to individuals with disabilities published by the World Wide Web Consortium, have become the effective standard for learner-facing aspects of our platform. We may not be successful in ensuring that our offerings and services comply with these changing statutory and regulatory requirements, which could make our solutions less attractive to our clients and students, and we expect to incur ongoing costs of compliance.\nOur activities are subject to federal and state laws and regulations and other requirements.\nAlthough we are not an institution of higher education, we are required to comply with certain education laws and regulations as a result of our role as a service provider to higher education institutions, either directly or indirectly through our contractual arrangements with university clients. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in breach of contract and indemnification claims and could cause damage to our reputation and impair our ability to grow our business and achieve profitability.\nActivities of the U.S. Congress or Department of Education could result in adverse legislation or regulatory actions or investigations.\nThe process of reauthorization of the HEA began in 2014 and is expected to continue until the HEA is updated. Congressional hearings will continue to be scheduled by the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Education and the Workforce and other Congressional committees regarding various aspects of the education industry, including accreditation matters, student debt, student recruiting, cost of tuition, distance learning, competency-based learning, student success and outcomes and other matters. Future hearings may include a discussion of the role of online program management companies.\nThe increased scrutiny and results-based accountability initiatives in the education sector, as well as ongoing policy differences in Congress regarding spending levels and other issues, could lead to significant changes in connection with the reauthorization of the HEA or otherwise. These changes may place new or additional regulatory burdens on postsecondary schools generally, and specific initiatives may be targeted at or have an impact upon companies like us that serve higher education. The adoption of any laws or regulations that limit our ability to provide our services to our university clients could compromise our ability to drive revenue through their programs or make our platform less attractive to them. Congress could also enact laws or authorize regulations that require us to modify our practices in ways that could increase our costs, including as a result of new regulatory burdens.\nIn addition, regulatory activities and initiatives of the DOE may have similar consequences for our business even in the absence of Congressional action. For example, DOE initiated two new rulemaking processes in 2021 that may impact our partners. While neither proceeding is expected to directly impact our business model, we cannot predict the impact that these and other, future DOE initiatives may have on us, our reputation or operating results.\nOur business model, which depends on our ability to receive a share of tuition revenue as payment from our university clients, has been validated by a DOE \u201cdear colleague\u201d letter, but such validation is not codified by statute or regulation and may be subject to change.\nEach institution that participates in Title IV programs agrees it will not \u201cprovide any commission, bonus, or other incentive payment based in any part, directly or indirectly, upon success in securing enrollments or the award of financial aid, to\nany person or entity who is engaged in any student recruitment or admission activity, or in making decisions regarding the award of Title IV, HEA program funds.\u201d Virtually all of our university clients participate in Title IV Programs.\nAlthough this rule, referred to as the incentive compensation rule, generally prohibits entities or individuals from receiving incentive-based compensation payments for the successful recruitment, admission or enrollment of students, the DOE provided official policy guidance in 2011 permitting tuition revenue-sharing arrangements known as the \u201cbundled services rule.\u201d Our current business model relies in part on the bundled services rule to enter into tuition revenue-sharing agreements with our university clients.\nBecause the bundled services rule was promulgated in the form of agency guidance issued by the DOE in the form of a \u201cdear colleague\u201d letter, or DCL, and is not codified by statute or regulation, there is risk that the rule could be altered or removed without customary administrative procedural requirements, such as adequate prior notice, that accompany formal agency rulemaking. Although the DCL remains the longstanding policy of the DOE, the bundled services rule could be reviewed, altered or vacated in the future. In addition, the legal weight the DCL would carry in litigation over the propriety of any specific compensation arrangements under the HEA or the incentive compensation rule is uncertain. We can offer no assurances as to how the DCL would be interpreted by a court. The revision, removal or invalidation of the bundled services rule by Congress, the DOE or a court, whether in an action involving our company or our university clients, or in action that does not involve us, could require us to change our business model and renegotiate the terms of many of our university client contracts and could compromise our ability to generate revenue.\nIf we or our subcontractors or agents violate the incentive compensation rule, we could be liable to our university clients for substantial fines, sanctions or other liabilities.\nEven though the DCL clarifies that tuition revenue-sharing arrangements with our university clients are permissible, we are still subject to other provisions of the incentive compensation rule that prohibit us from offering to our employees who are involved with or responsible for recruiting or admissions activities any bonus or incentive-based compensation based on the successful identification, admission or enrollment of students into any institution. If we or our subcontractors or agents violate the incentive compensation rule, we could be liable to our university clients for substantial fines, sanctions or other liabilities, including liabilities related to \u201cwhistleblower\u201d claims under the federal False Claims Act. Any such claims, even if without merit, could require us to incur significant costs to defend the claim, distract management\u2019s attention and damage our reputation.\nIf we or our subcontractors or agents violate the misrepresentation rule, or similar federal and state regulatory requirements, we could face fines, sanctions and other liabilities.\nWe are required to comply with other regulations promulgated by the DOE that affect our student acquisition activities, including the misrepresentation rule. The misrepresentation rule is broad in scope and applies to statements our employees, subcontractors or agents may make about the nature of a university client\u2019s program, a university client\u2019s financial charges or the employability of a university client\u2019s program graduates. A violation of this rule, FTC rules or other federal or state regulations applicable to our marketing activities by an employee, subcontractor or agent performing services for university clients could lead to governmental investigations and sanctions, hurt our reputation, result in the termination of university client contracts, require us to pay fines or other monetary penalties or require us to pay the costs associated with indemnifying a university client from private claims or government investigations.\nIf our university clients fail to maintain their state authorizations, or we or our university clients violate other state laws and regulations, students in their offerings could be adversely affected and we could lose our ability to operate in that state and provide services to these university clients.\nOur university clients must be authorized in certain states to offer online educational offerings, engage in recruiting and operate externships, internships, clinical training or other forms of field experience, depending on state law. The loss of or failure to obtain state authorization would, among other things, limit the ability of a university client to enroll students in that state, render the university client and its students ineligible to participate in Title IV programs in that state, diminish the attractiveness of the university client\u2019s offering and ultimately compromise our ability to generate revenue and become profitable.\nIn addition, if we or any of our university clients fail to comply with any state agency\u2019s rules, regulations or standards beyond authorizations, the state agency or state attorney general could limit the ability of the university client to offer educational offerings in that state or limit our ability to perform our contractual obligations to our university client in that state.\nIf our university clients fail to maintain institutional or programmatic accreditation for their offerings, our revenue could be materially affected.\nThe loss or suspension of a university client\u2019s accreditation or other adverse action by the university client\u2019s institutional or programmatic accreditor would render the institution or its offerings ineligible to participate in Title IV programs, could prevent the university client from offering certain educational offerings and, for certain degree-granting programs, could make it impossible for the graduates of the university client\u2019s program to obtain employment in the profession for which they trained. If any of these results occurs, it could hurt our ability to generate revenue from that offering.\nOur future growth could be impaired if our university clients fail to obtain timely approval from applicable regulatory agencies to offer new programs, make substantive changes to existing programs or expand their programs into or within certain states.\nOur university clients are required to obtain the appropriate approvals from the DOE and applicable state and accrediting regulatory agencies for new programs or locations, which may be conditioned, delayed or denied in a manner that could impair our strategic plans and future growth. Regulatory constraints have resulted in delays to various approvals our university clients are requesting, and such delays could in turn delay the timing of our ability to generate revenue from our university clients\u2019 programs.\nIf more state agencies require specialized approval of our university clients\u2019 offerings, our operating costs could increase significantly, approval times could lag, or we could be prohibited from operating in certain states.\nIn addition to state licensing agencies, our university clients may be required to obtain approval from professional licensing boards in certain states to offer specialized programs in specific fields of study. Currently, relatively few states require institutions to obtain professional board approval for their online educational offerings. However, more states could pass laws requiring our university clients\u2019 offerings, such as graduate programs in teaching or nursing, to obtain approval from state professional boards. If a significant number of states pass additional laws requiring schools to obtain professional board approval, the cost of obtaining all necessary state approvals could dramatically increase, which could make our platform less attractive to university clients, and these university clients could be barred from operating in some states entirely.\nEvolving regulations and legal obligations related to data privacy, data protection and information security and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations, could have an adverse effect on our business.\nThe legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data security is rapidly evolving and likely is to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. In providing our platform to university clients and in operating our business, we collect and process regulated personal information from students, faculty, prospective students and employees. Our handling of this personal information is subject to a variety of laws and regulations, which have been adopted by federal, state and foreign governments to regulate the collection, distribution, use and storage of personal information. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with these privacy laws and regulations or any security incident that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of this personal information in our possession, could result in government enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity, all of which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business.\nVarious federal, state and foreign legislative, regulatory or other governmental bodies have adopted laws or regulations concerning privacy, security, data storage and data protection that could materially adversely impact our business. Moreover, much of the personal information we collect and process is regulated by multiple privacy laws across various jurisdictions. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which took effect in May 2018, introduced robust new requirements for the protection of personal data of individuals in the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) and substantial fines for non-compliance, including fines up to 4% of a Company\u2019s annual global revenue. However, with the withdrawal of the United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d) from the EU in 2020, we must also now comply with the local laws of that jurisdiction such as the UK Data Protection Act 2018 and the UK General Data Protection Regulation. This introduces the risk of possible enforcement from a separate data protection authority, with its distinct power to impose substantial fines for non-compliance. As another example, in July 2020, South Africa\u2019s privacy law known as the Protection of Personal Information Act became effective, mandating new requirements for processing of personal information by entities domiciled in South Africa, and our Company must comply with these laws.\nWe are also subject to evolving EU rules on data transfer, as we may transfer personal data from the European Economic Area to other jurisdictions. The invalidation of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework in July 2020 and introduction of updated Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) in 2021 for alternative means of cross-border data transfer, introduces additional complexity and risk to our compliance measures.\nIn the U.S., the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) took effect in January 2020. Pursuant to the CCPA, we are required, among other things, to meet certain enhanced notice requirements to California residents regarding our use or disclosure of their personal information, allow California residents to opt-out of certain uses and disclosures of their personal\ninformation without penalty, and provide Californians with other choices related to personal data in our possession. The California Attorney General may seek substantial monetary penalties and injunctive relief in the event of our non-compliance with the CCPA. The CCPA also allows for private lawsuits from Californians in the event of certain data breaches.\nWe also expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations, rulings and industry standards concerning privacy, security, data storage and data protection in the U.S., the EU and other jurisdictions, and we cannot yet determine the impact such future laws, regulations, rulings and standards may have on our business. For example, the European ePrivacy Directive (Directive 2002/58/EC, as amended by Directive 2009/136/EC), which obliges EU member states to introduce certain national laws regulating privacy in the electronic communications sector, will soon be replaced by the ePrivacy Regulation. As the text of the ePrivacy Regulation is still under development and in draft form, and as further guidance is issued and interpretations of both the ePrivacy Regulation and the GDPR develop, it is difficult to assess the impact of either on our business or operations, but it may require us to modify our data practices and policies. In addition, in 2021 new privacy laws were passed in China, Brazil and other jurisdictions, and many countries are considering updates to their current data protection regulations, including Australia and India.\nIn the U.S., various states have proposed privacy laws that represent a trend towards stronger privacy protections and greater data transparency. In January 2023, the California Consumer Privacy Act, which includes significant amendments to the CCPA, becomes operative, thereby placing additional obligations on us to protect personal information, to offer enhanced data rights to Californians, and to provide notice regarding our data sharing practices. Likewise, both Colorado and Virginia passed consumer privacy laws in 2021. Without an overarching federal law driving privacy compliance in the U.S., the risk is high of a patchwork of privacy legislation formed by individual state laws, similar to the states\u2019 approach to breach notification obligations. This could not only increase costs for compliance but also raise the risk of enforcement by individual state attorneys general.\nComplying with these and other changing requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs, or require us to change our business practices, any of which could materially adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe are required to comply with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, or FERPA, and failure to do so could harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.\nFERPA generally prohibits an institution of higher education participating in Title IV programs from disclosing personally identifiable information from a student\u2019s education records without the student\u2019s consent. Our university clients and their students disclose to us certain information that originates from or comprises a student education record under FERPA. As an entity that provides services to institutions participating in Title IV programs, we are indirectly subject to FERPA, and we may not transfer or otherwise disclose any personally identifiable information from a student record to another party other than in a manner permitted under the statute. If we violate FERPA, it could result in a material breach of contract with one or more of our university clients and could harm our reputation. Further, in the event that we disclose student information in violation of FERPA, the DOE could require a university client to suspend our access to its student information for at least five years.\nIn our Alternative Credential Segment, we are subject to risks and compliance rules and regulations related to the third-party credit card payment processing platform integrated within our websites or otherwise used by our business.\nStudents typically use a credit or debit card to pay application and enrollment fees and to make tuition payments for the offerings in our Alternative Credential Segment that are not free. We are subject to payment card association operating rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. We believe that we and the payment processing service providers we use are compliant in all material respects with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. However, there is no guarantee that such compliance will be maintained or that compliance will prevent illegal or improper use of our systems that are integrated with our payment processing providers. If we or any of the third-party payment processors we use fail to be in compliance with applicable credit card rules and regulations, we may be required to migrate to an alternate payment processor which could result in transaction downtime during the migration and/or a loss of students and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to governmental export, import and sanctions controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets and subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws.\nOur business activities are subject to various restrictions under U.S. export and similar laws and regulations, including the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Export Administration Regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Controls. The U.S. export control laws and U.S. economic sanctions laws include restrictions or prohibitions on the sale of certain services to U.S. embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments, persons, and entities. In addition, various countries regulate the import of certain technology and have\nenacted or could enact laws that could limit our ability to provide students access to our platform or could limit our students\u2019 ability to access or use our services in those countries.\nChanges in our platform, or future changes in export and import regulations, may prevent our international students from utilizing our platform or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our platform to certain countries, governments, or persons altogether. Any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions, or related legislation or changes in the countries, governments, persons, or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our platform by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell subscriptions to our platform to, existing or potential students internationally. Any decreased use of our platform or limitation on our ability to export or sell our platform would adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial results.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nWe operate in an industry with extensive intellectual property litigation. Claims of infringement against us may hurt our business.\nOur success depends, in part, upon our ability to avoid infringing intellectual property rights owned by others and being able to resolve claims of intellectual property infringement without major financial expenditures or adverse consequences. The technology and software fields generally are characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation and many companies that own, or claim to own, intellectual property have aggressively asserted their rights. In addition, we face potential copyright and trademark infringement from the content we produce in connection with our marketing activities, including in websites related to our offerings. From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims relating to the intellectual property rights of others, and we expect that third parties will assert intellectual property claims against us, particularly as we expand the complexity and scope of our business. In addition, our university client agreements require us to indemnify our university clients against claims that our platform infringes the intellectual property rights of third parties.\nFuture litigation may be necessary to defend ourselves or our university clients from intellectual property infringement claims or to establish our proprietary rights. Some of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do and would be able to sustain the costs of complex intellectual property litigation to a greater degree and for longer periods of time than we could. In addition, patent holding companies that focus solely on extracting royalties and settlements by enforcing patent rights may target us. Regardless of whether claims that we are infringing patents or other intellectual property rights have any merit, these claims are time-consuming and costly to evaluate and defend and could:\n\u2022hurt our reputation;\n\u2022adversely affect our relationships with our current or future university clients;\n\u2022cause delays or stoppages in providing our platform;\n\u2022divert management\u2019s attention and resources;\n\u2022require technology changes to our software that could cause us to incur substantial cost;\n\u2022subject us to significant liabilities; and\n\u2022require us to cease some or all of our activities.\nIn addition to liability for monetary damages against us, which may include attorneys\u2019 fees, treble damages in the event of a finding of willful infringement, or, in some circumstances, damages against our university clients, we may be prohibited from developing, commercializing or continuing to provide some or all of our bundled technology-enabled platform unless we obtain licenses from, and pay royalties to, the holders of the patents or other intellectual property rights, which may not be available on commercially favorable terms, or at all.\nWe may incur liability, or our reputation may be harmed, as a result of the activities of our university clients and students or the content in our online learning platforms.\nWe may be subject to potential liability for the activities of our university clients or students in connection with the data they post or store in our online learning platforms. For example, university personnel or students, or our employees or independent contractors, may post to our online learning platforms various articles or other third-party content for use in class discussions or within asynchronous lessons.\nVarious U.S. federal statutes may apply to us with respect to these activities. For example, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, or DMCA and the Communications Decency Act, or CDA, have provisions that limit our liability for certain content posted by third parties on our platforms.\nAlthough statutes and case law in the U.S. have generally shielded us from liability for these activities to date, court rulings in pending or future litigation may narrow the scope of protection afforded us under these laws. In addition, laws governing these activities are unsettled in many international jurisdictions. As a result, we could incur liability to third parties for the unauthorized duplication, distribution or other use of third-party content. Any such claims could subject us to costly litigation and impose a significant strain on our financial resources and management personnel regardless of whether the claims have merit. Our various liability insurance coverages may not cover potential claims of this type adequately or at all, and we may be required to alter or cease our uses of such material, which may include changing or removing content from courses or altering the functionality of our online learning platform, or to pay monetary damages.\nAdditionally, university personnel or students, or our employees or independent contractors could use our online learning platform to store or process regulated personal information without our knowledge. In the event that our systems experience a data security incident, or an individual or entity accesses information without, or in excess of, proper authorization, we could be subject to data security incident notification laws, as described elsewhere, which may require prompt remediation and notification to individuals. If we are unaware of the data and information stored on our systems, we may be unable to appropriately comply with all legal obligations, and we may be exposed to governmental enforcement or prosecution actions, private litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity and these incidents could harm our reputation and business.\nOur failure to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our platform, weaken our competitive position and reduce our revenue.\nWe regard the protection of our intellectual property, which includes trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks and domain names, as critical to our success. We protect our proprietary information from unauthorized use and disclosure by entering into confidentiality agreements with any party that may come in contact with such information. We also seek to ensure that we own intellectual property created for us by signing agreements with employees, independent contractors, consultants, companies and any other third party that may create intellectual property for us that assigns any copyright and patent rights to us. However, these arrangements and the other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent the misappropriation of our proprietary information or deter independent development of similar technologies by others.\nWe pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks and service marks in the United States and in jurisdictions outside the United States. However, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe on our trademark or service mark rights, third parties may challenge our trademark or service mark rights, and pending or future trademark or service mark applications may not be approved. In addition, effective trademark protection may not be available in every country in which we operate or intend to operate. In any or all cases, we may be required to expend significant time and expense to prevent infringement or enforce our rights.\nMonitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and costly. Our efforts to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property. Further, we may not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights. Our competitors may also independently develop similar technology. In addition, the laws of many countries may not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States. Further, the laws in the United States and elsewhere change rapidly, and any future changes could adversely affect us and our intellectual property rights. Our failure to meaningfully protect our intellectual property could result in competitors offering services that incorporate our most technologically advanced features, which could seriously reduce demand for our platform. In addition, we may in the future need to initiate litigation such as infringement or administrative proceedings, to protect our intellectual property rights. Litigation, whether we are a plaintiff or a defendant, can be expensive, time-consuming and may divert the efforts of our technical staff and managerial personnel, whether or not such litigation results in a determination that is unfavorable to us. In addition, litigation is inherently uncertain, and thus we may not be able to stop our competitors from infringing upon our intellectual property rights.\nThe use of \u201copen source\u201d software in our platform could negatively affect our ability to offer our platform and subject us to possible litigation.\nA portion of our platform incorporates so-called \u201copen source\u201d software, and we may incorporate additional open source software in the future. Certain open source licenses may, in certain circumstances, require us to offer our platform that incorporates the open source software for no cost, to make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon, incorporating or using the open source software and to license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open source license. Our efforts to monitor the use of open source software in our platform to ensure that no open source software is used in such a way as to require us to disclose our source code when we do not wish to do so, may be unable to prevent such use from occurring. In addition, if a third-party software provider has incorporated certain types of open source software into software we license from such third party without our knowledge, we could, under certain circumstances, be required to comply with the foregoing conditions. If an author or other third party that distributes open source software that we use were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses, we could be\nrequired to incur significant legal expenses defending against such allegations and could be subject to significant damages, including being enjoined from offering the component of our platform that contained the open source software and being required to comply with the foregoing conditions, which could disrupt our ability to offer certain components of our platform.\nWe could also be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. The terms of many open source licenses to which we are subject have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts. Accordingly, there is a risk that those licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to offer our platform. Litigation could be costly for us to defend, have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition and require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our products.\nIndividuals that appear in content hosted on our online learning platform may claim violation of their rights.\nFaculty and students that appear in video segments hosted on our online learning platform may claim that proper assignments, licenses, consents and releases were not obtained for use of their likenesses, images or other contributed content. Our contracts typically require that our university clients ensure that proper assignments, licenses, consents and releases are obtained for their course material, but we cannot know with certainty that they have obtained all necessary rights. Moreover, the laws governing rights of publicity and privacy, and the laws governing faculty ownership of course content, are imprecise and adjudicated on a case-by-case basis, such that the enforcement of agreements to transfer the necessary rights is unclear. As a result, we could incur liability to third parties for the unauthorized duplication, display, distribution or other use of this material. Any such claims could subject us to costly litigation and impose a significant strain on our financial resources and management personnel regardless of whether the claims have merit. Our various liability insurance coverages may not cover potential claims of this type adequately or at all, and we may be required to alter or cease our use of such material, which may include changing or removing content from courses, or to pay monetary damages. Moreover, claims by faculty and students could damage our reputation, regardless of whether such claims have merit.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur operating results have fluctuated in the past and may do so in the future, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur operating results have historically fluctuated due to seasonality and changes in our business, and our future operating results may vary significantly due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. You should not rely on period-to-period comparisons of our operating results as an indication of our future performance. Factors that may cause fluctuations in our operating results include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022the timing of our costs incurred in connection with the launch of new degree programs and the delay in receiving revenue from these new programs, which delay may last for several years;\n\u2022seasonal variation driven by the semester schedules for our university clients\u2019 degree programs and seasonal engagement patterns of students on the edX marketplace, which may vary from year to year;\n\u2022changes in the student enrollment and retention levels in our university clients\u2019 offerings;\n\u2022changes in our key metrics or the methods used to calculate our key metrics;\n\u2022changes in tuition rates;\n\u2022the timing and amount of our marketing and sales expenses;\n\u2022costs necessary to improve and maintain our platform;\n\u2022fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including on the global economy, educational institutions and our results of operations;\n\u2022costs related to any acquisition and integration of business and technology;\n\u2022our ability to effectively integrate businesses and technologies that we acquire;\n\u2022impairment of goodwill or intangible assets; and\n\u2022changes in the prospects of the economy generally, which could alter current or prospective university clients\u2019 or students\u2019 spending priorities or could increase the time it takes us to launch new offerings.\nOur operating results may fall below the expectations of market analysts and investors in some future periods, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline substantially.\nThe trading price of the shares of our common stock may be volatile, and purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nThe trading price of the shares of our common stock may be volatile. The stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, investors may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the price paid for the shares. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u2022actual or anticipated variations in our operating results;\n\u2022variations between our actual operating results and the expectations of securities analysts, investors and the financial community;\n\u2022changes in financial estimates by us or by any securities analysts who might cover our stock or our failure to meet these financial estimates;\n\u2022conditions or trends in our industry, the stock market or the economy;\n\u2022the level of demand for our stock, including the amount of short interest in our stock;\n\u2022stock market price and volume fluctuations of comparable companies and, in particular, those that operate in the software and information technology industries;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of new product or service offerings, significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships or divestitures;\n\u2022announcements of investigations or regulatory scrutiny of our operations or lawsuits filed against us;\n\u2022capital commitments;\n\u2022investors\u2019 general perception of our company and our business;\n\u2022actions instituted by activist shareholders or others;\n\u2022lawsuits threatened or filed against us;\n\u2022recruitment or departure of key personnel; and\n\u2022sales of our common stock, including sales by our directors and officers or specific stockholders; and\n\u2022other factors such as political or social unrest, terrorist attacks, other hostilities, natural disasters and potential public health crises, such as COVID-19.\nActivist shareholders who disagree with the composition of our board of directors, our strategy or the way we are managed may seek to effect change through various strategies that range from private engagement to publicity campaigns, proxy contests, efforts to force transactions not supported by our board of directors and litigation. Responding to these actions may be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations, divert the attention of our board of directors, management and employees and interfere with the execution of our strategic plan. A contested election could also require us to incur substantial legal and public relations fees and proxy solicitation expenses. The perceived uncertainty as to our future direction resulting from activist strategies could also affect the market price and volatility of our common stock.\nAs described in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, certain stockholders have initiated class action lawsuits against us and certain of our employees and directors. Our defense against this litigation has caused and will continue to cause us to incur additional expenses and continue to divert management\u2019s attention and resources from our business.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law may prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to change our management and hinder efforts to acquire a controlling interest in us, and the market price of our common stock may be lower as a result.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may make it difficult for a third party to acquire, or attempt to acquire, control of our company, even if a change in control is considered favorable by you and other stockholders. For example, our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The board of directors can fix the price, rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions of the preferred stock\nwithout any further vote or action by our stockholders. An issuance of shares of preferred stock may result in the loss of voting control to other stockholders, which could delay or prevent a change in control transaction. As a result, the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of our stockholders may be adversely affected.\nOur charter documents also contain other provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect, including:\n\u2022only one of our three classes of directors is elected each year;\n\u2022stockholders are not entitled to remove directors other than by a 662/3% vote and only for cause;\n\u2022stockholders are not permitted to take actions by written consent;\n\u2022stockholders are not permitted to call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022our board of directors is allowed to adopt, amend or repeal our bylaws; and\n\u2022stockholders are required to give us advance notice of their intention to nominate directors or submit proposals for consideration at stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, we are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which regulates corporate acquisitions by prohibiting Delaware corporations from engaging in specified business combinations with particular stockholders of those companies. These provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control transaction. They could also have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our common stock, including transactions that may be in your best interests. These provisions may also prevent changes in our management or limit the price that investors are willing to pay for our stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the state and federal courts located within the State of Delaware are the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, stockholders, or employees and, in turn, discourage lawsuits against our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, another state or federal court in the State of Delaware) will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, stockholders, officers, or other employees to us or our stockholders; any action arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or our bylaws; and any action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum provision would not apply to any action brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts of the United States have exclusive jurisdiction.\nThis exclusive forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our current or former directors, officers, stockholders, or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our current and former directors, officers, stockholders, and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the exclusive forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur further significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nConcentration of ownership of our common stock among our existing executive officers, directors and large stockholders may prevent smaller stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions.\nOur executive officers, directors and current beneficial owners of 5% or more of our common stock and their respective affiliates, in the aggregate, beneficially own a substantial percentage of our outstanding common stock. These persons, acting together, are able to significantly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors, any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other significant corporate transaction. The interests of this group of stockholders may not coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gains and you may never receive a return on your investment.\nWe have not declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock to date. We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. In addition, the terms of our Term Loan Agreement preclude, and the terms of any future debt agreements are likely to similarly preclude, us from paying dividends. As a result,\ncapital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nIncreased scrutiny and changing expectations from investors, customers, employees, and others regarding our environmental, social and governance practices and reporting could cause us to incur additional costs, devote additional resources and expose us to additional risks, which could adversely impact our reputation, customer acquisition and retention, access to capital and employee retention.\nCompanies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny related to their environmental, social and governance, or ESG, practices and reporting. Investors, customers, employees and other stakeholders have focused increasingly on ESG practices and placed increasing importance on the implications and social cost of their investments, purchases and other interactions with companies. For example, many investment funds focus on positive ESG business practices and sustainability scores when making investments and may consider a company\u2019s ESG or sustainability scores as a reputational or other factor in making an investment decision. In addition, investors, particularly institutional investors, use these scores to benchmark companies against their peers and if a company is perceived as lagging, these investors may engage with such company to improve ESG disclosure or performance and may also make voting decisions on this basis. With this increased focus and demand, public reporting regarding ESG practices is becoming more broadly expected. If our ESG practices and reporting do not meet investor, customer, or employee expectations, which continue to evolve, our brand and reputation may be negatively impacted. Any disclosure we make may include our policies and practices on a variety of ESG matters, including corporate governance, environmental compliance, employee health and safety practices, human capital management, and workforce inclusion and diversity. It is possible that stakeholders may not be satisfied with our ESG reporting, our ESG practices or our speed of adoption. We could also incur additional costs and devote additional resources to monitor, report and implement various ESG practices. If we fail, or are perceived to be failing, to meet the standards included in any sustainability disclosure or the expectations of our various stakeholders, it could negatively impact our reputation, access to capital and employee retention.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations of the Nasdaq Global Select Market. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are required to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our Form 10-K filing for that year, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This may require us to incur substantial additional professional fees and internal costs to further expand our accounting and finance functions and expend significant management efforts.\nWe may in the future discover material weaknesses in our system of internal financial and accounting controls and procedures that could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements. In addition, our internal control over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to errors or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected.\nIf we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner, or if we are unable to maintain proper and effective internal controls, we may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements. If that were to happen, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our common stock is listed, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, or other regulatory authorities.", "PERMNO": 14554, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "TWOU"}
