RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in evaluating the Company and its common stock. Any of the following risks, or other risks or uncertainties not presently known or currently deemed immaterial, could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations or financial condition, and could, in turn, impact the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nRisks Relating to the Company\u2019s Businesses and Operations\nThe Company Operates in a Highly Competitive Business Environment, and its Success Depends on its Ability to Compete Effectively, Including by Responding to Evolving Technologies and Changes in Consumer and Customer Behavior.\nThe Company faces significant competition from other providers of news, information, entertainment and real estate-related products and services. See \u201cBusiness Overview\u201d for more information regarding competition within each of the Company\u2019s segments. This competition continues to intensify as a result of changes in technologies, platforms and business models and corresponding changes in consumer and customer behavior. For example, enhanced internet capabilities, developments in content distribution platforms and the emergence of new media channels have increased the choices available to consumers for content consumption and adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, demand for the Company\u2019s newspapers, television programs and other products and services and the price consumers are willing to pay. Consumption of the Company\u2019s content on third-party delivery platforms may also lead to loss of distribution and monetization control, loss of a direct relationship with consumers and lower engagement and subscription rates. While the Company has multi-year agreements with several large platforms pursuant to which the Company licenses its content for use on such platforms in exchange for significant payments, there is no guarantee that these content license agreements will be renewed on terms favorable to the Company or at all. These trends and developments have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, both the Company\u2019s circulation and subscription revenue and, in turn, advertisers\u2019 willingness to purchase advertising from the Company, as well as increase subscriber acquisition, retention and other costs.\nTechnological developments have also increased competition in other ways. For example, digital video content is becoming more prevalent and attractive for many consumers via direct-to-consumer offerings, as internet streaming capabilities have enabled the disaggregation of content delivery from the ownership of network infrastructure. Other digital platforms and technologies, such as user-generated content platforms and self-publishing tools, combined, in some cases, with widespread availability of sophisticated search engines and public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information and solutions, have also reduced the effort and expense of locating, gathering and disseminating data and producing and distributing certain types of content on a wide scale, allowing digital content providers, customers, suppliers and other third parties to compete with the Company, often at a lower cost, and potentially diminishing the perceived value of the Company\u2019s offerings. Additional digital distribution channels, such as online retailers and digital marketplaces, have presented, and may continue to present, challenges to the Company\u2019s business models, including its traditional book publishing model, which could adversely affect sales volume and/or pricing.\nIn order to compete effectively, the Company must differentiate its brands and their associated products and services, respond to new technologies, distribution channels and platforms, develop new products and services and consistently anticipate and respond to changes in consumer and customer needs and preferences, which in turn, depends on many factors both within and beyond its control. For example, the Company relies on brand awareness, reputation and acceptance of its high-quality differentiated content and other products and services, the breadth, depth and accuracy of information provided by its digital real estate services and professional information businesses, as well as its wide array of digital offerings, in order to retain and grow its audiences, consumers and subscribers. However, consumer preferences change frequently and are difficult to predict, and when faced with a\nmultitude of choices, consumers may place greater value on the convenience and price of content and other products and services than they do on their source, quality or reliability. Online traffic and product and service purchases are also driven by internet search results, referrals from social media and other platforms and visibility on digital marketplace platforms and in mobile app stores. Search engine results and digital marketplace and mobile app store rankings are based on algorithms that are changed frequently, and social media and other platforms may also vary their emphasis on what content to highlight for users. The Company has limited control over these changes, and any failure to successfully manage and adapt to them could impede the Company\u2019s ability to compete effectively by significantly decreasing traffic to its digital offerings, lowering advertiser interest in those offerings, increasing costs if free traffic is replaced with paid traffic and lowering product sales and subscriptions.\nThe Company expects to continue to pursue new strategic initiatives and develop new and enhanced products and services in order to remain competitive, such as additional streaming features and new content aggregation offerings, innovative digital news products and experiences, its recently launched TalkTV in the U.K. and the continued expansion into various adjacencies at its digital real estate services businesses. The Company has incurred, and expects to continue to incur, significant costs in order to implement these strategies and develop these new and improved products and services, including costs relating to the initiatives referenced above, as well as other costs to acquire, develop, adopt, upgrade and exploit new and existing technologies and attract and retain employees with the necessary knowledge and skills. There can be no assurance any strategic initiatives, products and services will be successful in the manner or time period or at the cost the Company expects or that it will realize the anticipated benefits it expects. The failure to realize those benefits could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSome of the Company\u2019s current and potential competitors have greater resources, fewer regulatory burdens, better competitive positions in certain areas, greater operating capabilities, greater access to sources of content, data, technology or other services or strategic relationships and/or easier access to financing, which may allow them to respond more effectively to changes in technology, consumer and customer needs and preferences and market conditions. Continued consolidation among competitors in certain industries in which the Company operates may increase these advantages, including through greater scale, financial leverage and/or access to content, data, technology and other offerings. If the Company is unable to compete successfully, its business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nA Decline in Customer Advertising Expenditures Could Cause the Company\u2019s Revenues and Operating Results to Decline Significantly.\nThe Company derives substantial revenues from the sale of advertising, and its ability to generate advertising revenue is dependent on a number of factors, including: (1) demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, (2) audience fragmentation, (3) digital advertising trends, (4) its ability to offer advertising products and formats sought by advertisers, (5) general economic and business conditions, (6) demographics of the customer base, (7) advertising rates, (8) advertising effectiveness and (9) maintaining its brand strength and reputation.\nDemand for the Company\u2019s products and services is evaluated based on a variety of metrics, which are used by advertisers to determine the amount of advertising to purchase from the Company and advertising rates. For the Company\u2019s digital offerings, advertisers evaluate demand based on metrics such as the number of visits, number of users and user engagement. Other metrics include circulation levels for the Company\u2019s newspapers, ratings points for its cable channels and number of listeners for its radio stations. Any difficulty or failure in accurately measuring demand, particularly demand generated through new platforms, may lead to under-measurement and, in turn, lower advertising pricing and spending.\nThe popularity of digital media among consumers as a source of news, entertainment, information and other content, and the ability of digital advertising to deliver targeted, measurable impressions promptly, has driven a corresponding shift in advertising from traditional channels to digital platforms and materially and adversely impacted the Company\u2019s print advertising revenues. Large digital platforms in particular, such as Facebook, Google and Amazon, which have extensive audience reach, data and targeting capabilities, continue to command an increasing share of the digital advertising market. New devices and technologies, as well as higher consumer engagement with other forms of digital media platforms such as online and mobile social networking, have also increased the number of media choices and formats available to audiences, resulting in audience fragmentation and increased competition for advertising. The range of advertising choices across digital products and platforms and the large inventory of available digital advertising space have historically resulted in significantly lower rates for digital advertising (particularly mobile advertising) than for print advertising. Consequently, despite continued growth in the Company\u2019s digital advertising revenues, such revenues may not be able to replace print advertising revenue lost as a result of the shift to digital consumption.\nThe digital advertising market also continues to undergo changes that may further impact digital advertising revenues. Programmatic buying channels that allow advertisers to buy audiences at scale play a significant role in the advertising marketplace and have caused and may continue to cause further downward pricing pressure and the loss of a direct relationship with marketers. Third-party delivery platforms may also lead to loss of distribution and monetization control, loss of a direct relationship with consumers and adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to understand its audience and/or collect and apply data for targeted advertising. The Company\u2019s digital advertising operations also rely on a small number of significant technologies such as Google\u2019s ad manager which, if interrupted or meaningfully changed, or if the providers leverage their power to alter the economic structure, could adversely impact advertising revenues and/or operating costs. In addition, evolving standards for the delivery of digital advertising, as well as the development and implementation of technology, regulations, policies and practices that adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to deliver, target or measure the effectiveness of its advertising, including blocking the display of advertising, browsing incognito, blocking or deleting cookies and IP addresses, the phase-out of support for third party cookies and mobile identifiers, as well as opt-in requirements and new privacy regulations, may also negatively impact digital advertising revenues. As the digital advertising market continues to evolve, the Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully for advertising budgets will depend on, among other things, its ability to drive scale, engage and grow digital audiences, collect and leverage better user data, develop new digital advertising products and formats such as branded and other custom content, and video and mobile advertising, and demonstrate the value of its advertising and the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s platforms to its advertising customers, including through more targeted, data-driven offerings.\nThe Company\u2019s print and digital advertising revenue is also affected generally by overall national and local economic and business conditions, which tend to be cyclical, as well as election and other news cycles. Natural disasters, including extreme weather, pandemics (including the novel coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) pandemic) and other widespread health crises, inflation, including higher labor costs, supply chain disruptions, war or acts of terrorism have led and could continue to lead to greater economic uncertainty and reduced spending by advertisers. The Company experienced a short-term decline in advertising during the third quarter of fiscal 2022 due to the war in Ukraine. While that decline was immaterial, continued economic disruption from the war has broadened inflationary pressures and may lead to decreased spending by advertisers. In addition, certain sectors of the economy account for a significant portion of the Company\u2019s advertising revenues, including retail, technology and finance. Some of these sectors, such as retail, are more sensitive to weakness in economic conditions, as well as increased online competition. A decline in the economic prospects of these and other advertisers or the economy in general could alter current or prospective advertisers\u2019 spending priorities or result in consolidation or closures across various industries, which may reduce the Company\u2019s overall advertising revenue.\nWhile the Company has adopted a number of strategies and initiatives to address these challenges, there can be no guarantee that its efforts will be successful. If the Company is unable to demonstrate the continuing value of its various platforms and high-quality content and brands or offer advertisers unique multi-platform advertising programs, its results may suffer. Reduced demand for the Company\u2019s offerings, a decrease in advertising expenditures by the Company\u2019s customers or a surplus of advertising inventory could lead to a reduction in pricing and advertising spending, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Inability to Obtain and Retain Sports, Entertainment and Other Programming Rights and Content Could Adversely Affect the Revenue of Certain of the Company\u2019s Operating Businesses, and Costs Could Also Increase Upon Renewal.\nCompetition for popular programming licensed from third parties is intense, and the success of certain of the Company\u2019s operating businesses, including its subscription television business, depends on, among other things, their ability to obtain and retain rights to desirable programming and certain related elements thereof, such as music rights, that enable them to deliver content to subscribers and audiences in the manner in which they wish to consume it and at competitive prices. The Company\u2019s subscription television business has experienced higher programming costs due to, among other things, (1) increases imposed by sports, entertainment and other programmers when offering new programming or upon the expiration of existing contracts; (2) incremental investment requirements for new services; (3) increased ability for other digital media companies, including streaming services, to obtain rights to popular or exclusive content; and (4) reduced content supply in the previous two years due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Certain of the Company\u2019s operating businesses, including its subscription television business, are party to contracts for a substantial amount of sports, entertainment and other programming rights with various third parties, including professional sports leagues and teams, television and motion picture producers and other content providers. These contracts have varying durations and renewal terms, and as they expire, renewals on favorable terms may be difficult to obtain. In the course of renegotiating these and other agreements as they expire, the financial and other terms, such as exclusivity rights, under these contracts may change unfavorably as a result of various reasons beyond the Company\u2019s control such as changes in the Company\u2019s ability to secure these rights. In order to retain or extend such rights, the Company may be required to increase the value of its offer to amounts that substantially exceed the existing contract costs, and third parties may outbid the Company for those rights and/or for any new programming offerings. In addition, as other content providers develop their own competing\nservices, they may be unwilling to provide the Company with access to certain content. For example, in connection with the launch of Disney+, Disney removed its Disney-branded movie channel and kids channels, as well as certain non-branded content, from the Foxtel platform. Consolidation among content providers may result in additional content becoming unavailable to the Company and/or increase the scale and leverage of those providers. The loss of rights or any adverse changes to existing rights, including loss of exclusivity, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to differentiate its services and the breadth or quality of the Company\u2019s content offerings, including the extent of the sports coverage and the availability of other popular entertainment programming offered by the Company, and lead to customer or audience dissatisfaction or loss, which could, in turn, adversely affect its revenues. In addition, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if upon renewal, escalations in programming rights costs are unmatched by increases in subscriber and carriage fees and advertising rates. The long-term nature of some of the Company\u2019s content commitments may also limit its flexibility in planning for, or reacting to changes in, business and economic conditions and the market segments in which it operates.\nThe Company Has Made and May Continue to Make Strategic Acquisitions, Investments and Divestitures That Introduce Significant Risks and Uncertainties.\nIn order to position its business to take advantage of growth opportunities, the Company has made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions and investments that involve significant risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include, among others: (1) the difficulty in integrating newly acquired businesses, operations and systems, such as financial reporting, internal controls and information technology (including cybersecurity and data protection controls), in an efficient and effective manner, (2) the challenges in achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and other anticipated benefits, (3) the potential loss of key employees, customers and suppliers, (4) with respect to investments, risks associated with the inability to control the operations of the business, (5) the risk of diverting the attention of the Company\u2019s senior management from the Company\u2019s operations, (6) in the case of foreign acquisitions and investments, the impact of specific economic, tax, currency, political, legal and regulatory risks associated with the relevant countries, (7) expenses and liabilities, both known and unknown, associated with the acquired businesses or investments, (8) in some cases, increased regulation and (9) in some cases, lower liquidity as a result of the use of cash or incurrence of debt to fund such acquisition or investment. If any acquired business or investment fails to operate as anticipated or an acquired business cannot be successfully integrated with the Company\u2019s existing businesses, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation could be adversely affected, and the Company may be required to record non-cash impairment charges for the write-down of certain acquired assets and investments. The Company\u2019s ability to continue to make acquisitions depends on the availability of suitable candidates at acceptable prices and whether restrictions are imposed by regulations, and competition for certain types of acquisitions is significant.\nThe Company has also divested and may in the future divest certain assets or businesses that no longer fit with its strategic direction or growth targets. Divestitures involve significant risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. These include, among others, the inability to find potential buyers on favorable terms, disruption to its business and/or diversion of management attention from other business concerns, loss of key employees, difficulties in separating the operations of the divested business, retention of certain liabilities related to the divested business and indemnification or other post-closing claims.\nThe Company\u2019s Pay-TV Business Depends on a Single or Limited Number of Suppliers for Certain Key Products and Services, and Any Reduction or Interruption in the Supply of These Products and Services or a Significant Increase in Price Could Have an Adverse Effect on the Company\u2019s Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition.\nThe Company\u2019s pay-TV business depends on a single or limited number of third party suppliers to supply certain key products and services necessary to provide its pay-TV services. In particular, the Company depends on Optus to provide all of its satellite transponder capacity, Akamai and Amazon Web Services (AWS) for content delivery networks (CDN) and hosting services and CommScope to supply its set-top boxes, and the Company expects its reliance on these suppliers to increase as it migrates broadcast subscribers to satellite or internet delivery by June 2023. During fiscal 2022, the Company\u2019s pay-TV business experienced hardware and technical equipment supply chain issues, including delays in the rollout of its new iQ5 set-top box due to a global silicon shortage, although these issues did not materially and adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations. If the Company\u2019s relationship with key suppliers deteriorates or any of these suppliers breaches or terminates its agreement with the Company or otherwise fails to perform its obligations in a timely manner, experiences operating or financial difficulties, is unable to meet demand due to further component shortages and other supply chain issues, labor shortages, insufficient capacity or otherwise, significantly increases the amount the Company pays for necessary products or services or ceases production of any necessary product, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, Telstra is the primary supplier of cable distribution capacity for the Company\u2019s pay-TV programming and is also currently the exclusive provider of wholesale fixed voice and broadband services for the Company\u2019s pay-TV business and the\nlargest reseller of its cable and satellite products. Any disruption in the supply of those services or a decline in Telstra\u2019s business could result in disruptions to the supply of, and/or reduce the number of subscribers for, the Company\u2019s products and services, which could, in turn, adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWhile the Company will seek alternative sources for the products and services described above where possible and/or permissible under applicable agreements, it may not be able to develop these alternative sources quickly and cost-effectively, which could impair its ability to timely deliver its products and services to its subscribers or operate its business.\nAny Significant Increase in the Cost to Print and Distribute the Company\u2019s Books and Newspapers or Disruption in the Company\u2019s Supply Chain or Printing and Distribution Channels may Adversely Affect the Company\u2019s Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition.\nPrinting and distribution costs, including the cost of paper, are a significant expense for the Company\u2019s book and newspaper publishing units. The price of paper has historically been volatile, and the Company expects increases in the near-term from various factors, including continued increases in supplier operating expenses due to rising raw material, energy, labor and transportation and other distribution costs, inflationary pressures and other factors. The Company also relies on third-party suppliers for deliveries of paper and on third-party printing and distribution partners to print and distribute its books and newspapers. During fiscal 2022, inflationary pressures, labor shortages, higher transportation costs and delays and other supply chain issues increased the cost to print and distribute the Company\u2019s books and newspapers, particularly manufacturing and freight costs at its book publishing business. These and other factors such as financial pressures, industry trends or economics, labor unrest, changes in laws and regulations, natural disasters, including extreme weather (which may occur with increasing frequency and intensity), pandemics and other widespread health crises or other circumstances affecting these third-party suppliers and print and distribution partners could continue to increase the Company\u2019s printing and distribution costs and could lead to disruptions, reduced operations or consolidations within the Company\u2019s printing and distribution supply chains and/or of third-party print sites and/or distribution routes. The Company may not be able to develop alternative providers quickly and cost-effectively, which could disrupt printing and distribution operations or increase the cost of printing and distributing the Company\u2019s books and newspapers. Any significant increase in these costs, undersupply or significant disruptions in the supply chain or the Company\u2019s printing and distribution channels could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s Reputation, Credibility and Brands are Key Assets and Competitive Advantages and its Business and Results of Operations may be Affected by How the Company is Perceived.\nThe Company\u2019s products and services are distributed under some of the world\u2019s most recognizable and respected brands, including The Wall Street Journal and premier news brands in Australia and the U.K., Dow Jones, HarperCollins Publishers, Foxtel, realestate.com.au, Realtor.com\u00ae, OPIS and many others, and the Company believes its success depends on its continued ability to maintain and enhance these brands. The Company\u2019s brands, credibility and reputation could be damaged by incidents that erode consumer and customer trust or a perception that the Company\u2019s products and services, including its journalism, programming, real estate information, benchmark and pricing services and other data and information, are low quality, unreliable or fail to maintain independence and integrity. Significant negative claims or publicity regarding the Company\u2019s products and services, operations, customer service, management, employees, advertisers and other business partners, business decisions, social responsibility and culture may damage its brands or reputation, even if such claims are untrue. The Company\u2019s brands and reputation may also be impacted by, or associated with, its public commitments to various corporate ESG initiatives, as well as positions the Company, its businesses or its publications take or do not take on social issues. The Company\u2019s disclosures on these matters, any failure to achieve its commitments or any unpopular positions could harm the Company\u2019s brands and reputation. To the extent the Company\u2019s brands, reputation and credibility are damaged, the Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain consumers, customers, advertisers and employees, as well as the Company\u2019s sales, business opportunities and profitability, could be adversely affected, which could in turn have an adverse impact on its business and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s International Operations Expose it to Additional Risks that Could Adversely Affect its Business, Operating Results and Financial Condition.\nIn its fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, approximately 61% of the Company\u2019s revenues were derived outside the U.S., and the Company is focused on expanding its international operations. There are risks inherent in doing business internationally and other risks may be heightened, including (1) issues related to staffing and managing international operations; (2) economic uncertainties and volatility in local markets, including as a result of inflationary pressures or a general economic slowdown or recession, and political or social instability; (3) the impact of catastrophic events in relevant jurisdictions such as natural disasters, including extreme weather (which may occur with increasing frequency and intensity), pandemics (including COVID-19) and other widespread health crises, acts of terrorism or war (including the war in Ukraine); (4) compliance with international laws,\nregulations and policies and potential adverse changes thereto, including foreign tax regimes, foreign ownership restrictions, restrictions on repatriation of funds and foreign currency exchange, data privacy requirements such as the GDPR, foreign intellectual property laws and local labor and employment laws and regulations; (5) compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations, export controls and economic sanctions; and (6) regulatory or governmental action against the Company\u2019s products and services such as censorship or other restrictions on access, expulsion of journalists or other employees and other retaliatory actions, including as a result of disputes with the U.S. Events or developments related to these and other risks associated with the Company\u2019s international operations could result in reputational harm and have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Challenges associated with operating globally may increase as the Company continues to expand into geographic areas that it believes represent the highest growth opportunities.\nThe Company is Party to Agreements with Third Parties Relating to Certain of its Businesses That Contain Operational and Management Restrictions and/or Other Rights That, Depending on the Circumstances, May Not be in the Best Interest of the Company.\nThe Company is party to agreements with third parties relating to certain of its businesses that restrict the Company\u2019s ability to take specified actions and contain other rights that, depending on the circumstances, may not be in the best interest of the Company. For example, the Company and Telstra are parties to a Shareholders\u2019 Agreement with respect to Foxtel containing certain minority protections for Telstra, including standard governance provisions, as well as transfer and exit rights. The Shareholders\u2019 Agreement provides Telstra with the right to appoint two directors to the Board of Foxtel, as well as Board and shareholder-level veto rights over certain non-ordinary course and/or material corporate actions that may prevent Foxtel from taking actions that are in the interests of the Company. The Shareholders\u2019 Agreement also provides for (1) certain transfer restrictions, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to effect such transfers and/or the prices at which those transfers may occur, and (2) exit arrangements, which could, in certain circumstances, force the Company to sell its interest, subject to rights of first and, in some cases, last refusals.\nIn addition, Move, the Company\u2019s digital real estate services business in the U.S., operates the Realtor.com\u00ae website under an agreement with NAR that is perpetual in duration. However, NAR may terminate the operating agreement for certain contractually-specified reasons upon expiration of applicable cure periods. If the operating agreement with NAR is terminated, the NAR License would also terminate, and Move would be required to transfer a copy of the software that operates the Realtor.com\u00ae website to NAR and provide NAR with copies of its agreements with advertisers and data content providers. NAR would then be able to operate a Realtor.com\u00ae website, either by itself or with another third party.\nDamage, Failure or Destruction of Satellites and Transmitter Facilities that the Company\u2019s Pay-TV Business Depends Upon to Distribute its Programming Could Adversely Affect the Company\u2019s Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition.\nThe Company\u2019s pay-TV business uses satellite systems to transmit its programming to its subscribers and/or authorized sublicensees. The Company\u2019s distribution facilities include uplinks, communications satellites and downlinks, and the Company also uses studio and transmitter facilities. Transmissions may be disrupted or degraded as a result of local disasters, including extreme weather (which may occur with increasing frequency and intensity), power outages, terrorist attacks, cyberattacks or other similar events, that damage or destroy on-ground uplinks or downlinks or studio and transmitter facilities, or as a result of damage to a satellite. Satellites are subject to significant operational and environmental risks while in orbit, including anomalies resulting from various factors such as manufacturing defects and problems with power or control systems, as well as environmental hazards such as meteoroid events, electrostatic storms and collisions with space debris. These events may result in the loss of one or more transponders on a satellite or the entire satellite and/or reduce the useful life of the satellite, which could, in turn, lead to a disruption or loss of video services to the Company\u2019s customers. The Company does not carry commercial insurance for business disruptions or losses resulting from the foregoing events as it believes the cost of insurance premiums is uneconomical relative to the risk. Instead, the Company seeks to mitigate this risk through the maintenance of backup satellite capacity and other contingency plans. However, these steps may not be sufficient, and if the Company is unable to secure alternate distribution, studio and/or transmission facilities in a timely manner, any such disruption or loss could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAttracting and Retaining Highly Qualified Personnel is Difficult and Costly, and the Failure to Do So Could Harm the Company\u2019s Business.\nThe Company\u2019s businesses depend upon the continued efforts, abilities and expertise of its corporate and divisional executive teams and other highly qualified employees who possess substantial business, technical and operational knowledge. The market for highly skilled personnel, including for technology-related, product development, data science, marketing and sales roles, is very competitive, and the Company cannot ensure that it will be successful in retaining these employees or hiring and training\nsuitable additions or replacements without significant costs or delays, particularly as it continues to focus on its digital products and services. These risks have been exacerbated by recent labor constraints and inflationary pressures on employee wages and benefits, which increased employee turnover and recruiting and retention costs in some functional areas and businesses during fiscal 2022. Changes in the nature of the office environment and working arrangements may, in some instances, also make it more difficult to hire and retain qualified employees if the Company\u2019s needs are not aligned with demand for flexibility or as a result of workplace culture challenges due to remote working. The loss of key employees, the failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel or higher costs associated with these efforts, could harm the Company\u2019s business, including the ability to execute its business strategy, and negatively impact its results of operations.\nThe Company is Subject to Payment Processing Risk Which Could Lead to Adverse Effects on the Company\u2019s Business and Results of Operations.\nThe Company\u2019s customers pay for its products and services using a variety of different payment methods, including credit and debit cards, prepaid cards, direct debit, online wallets and through direct carrier and partner billing. The Company relies on internal and third party systems to process payment. Acceptance and processing of these payment methods are subject to certain rules and regulations and require payment of interchange and other fees. To the extent there are increases in payment processing fees, material changes in the payment ecosystem, delays in receiving payments from payment processors, any failures to comply with, or changes to, rules or regulations concerning payments, loss of payment or billing partners and/or disruptions or failures in, or fraudulent use of or access to, payment processing systems or payment products, the Company\u2019s results of operations could be adversely impacted and it could suffer reputational harm. Furthermore, if the Company is unable to maintain its fraud and chargeback rates at acceptable levels, card networks may impose fines and its card approval rate may be impacted. The termination of the Company\u2019s ability to process payments on any major payment method would adversely affect its business and results of operations.\nLabor Disputes May Have an Adverse Effect on the Company\u2019s Business.\nIn some of the Company\u2019s businesses, it engages the services of employees who are subject to collective bargaining agreements. If the Company is unable to renew expiring collective bargaining agreements, it is possible that the affected unions could take action in the form of strikes or work stoppages. Such actions, as well as higher costs in connection with these collective bargaining agreements or a significant labor dispute, could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business by causing delays in production or by reducing profit margins, and these risks may be exacerbated by recent labor constraints and inflationary pressures on employee wages and benefits.\nMacroeconomic and Market Risks\nWeak Domestic and Global Economic Conditions and Volatility and Disruption in the Financial and Other Markets May Adversely Affect the Company\u2019s Business.\nThe U.S. and global economies and markets have weakened recently and are experiencing uncertainty and volatility due to, among other things, higher inflation, changes in monetary policy, increased interest rates, supply chain disruptions, volatile foreign currency exchange rates, the war in Ukraine, the ongoing recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and trade disputes and other geopolitical events. These conditions increased the Company\u2019s costs in fiscal 2022 and higher home prices and interest rates, in particular, contributed to recent declines in real estate lead and transaction volumes and adjacent businesses at its digital real estate services business. These and other similar conditions have in the past also resulted in, and could in the future lead to, among other things, a tightening of, and in some cases more limited access to, the credit and capital markets, lower levels of liquidity, increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy, lower consumer and business spending, lower consumer net worth and a decline in the real estate and energy and commodities markets. Such weakness and uncertainty and associated market disruptions have often led to broader, prolonged economic downturns that have historically resulted in lower advertising expenditures, lower demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, unfavorable changes in the mix of products and services purchased, pricing pressures, higher borrowing costs and decreased ability of third parties to satisfy their obligations to the Company and have adversely affected the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Any continued or recurring economic weakness is likely to have a similar impact on the Company\u2019s business and reduce its circulation and subscription, advertising, real estate, consumer and other revenues and otherwise negatively impact the performance of its businesses. The Company is particularly exposed to (1) certain Australian business risks because it holds a substantial amount of Australian assets and generated approximately 40% of its fiscal 2022 revenues from Australia and (2) to a lesser extent, business risks relating to the U.K., where it generated approximately 13% of its fiscal 2022 revenues. As a result, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by negative developments in the Australian and U.K. markets.\nThe Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic and Other Similar Epidemics, Pandemics or Widespread Health Crises is Difficult to Predict and Could Adversely Affect the Company\u2019s Business and Results of Operations.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak and measures to prevent its spread caused significant and prolonged unemployment, a decline in consumer confidence, changes in consumer behavior, significant economic deterioration, volatility in the capital markets, inflation, supply chain disruptions and an increasingly competitive labor market and have had, and may in the future have, an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations. For example, business restrictions and shelter-in-place orders caused a decline in print newspaper volumes, while postponements and cancellations of sports events negatively impacted commercial subscription revenues and broadcast and Kayo Sports subscribers. Advertising revenues also declined due to the resulting economic downturn. Other epidemics, pandemics or widespread health crises may have similar effects.\nWhile restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic have eased, the extent to which it and any similar epidemics, pandemics or widespread health crises may impact the Company in the future will depend on, among other things, the severity, duration, spread and any reoccurrence of such crises (including due to the emergence of new variants), the impact of governmental actions and business, consumer and customer behavior in response, the effectiveness of actions taken to contain or mitigate outbreaks and prevent or limit any reoccurrence, including the development, availability and public acceptance of effective treatments and vaccines, the resulting global economic conditions and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic and other similar epidemics, pandemics or widespread health crises may amplify many of the other risk factors disclosed elsewhere in this \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nFluctuations in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates Could Have an Adverse Effect on the Company\u2019s Results of Operations.\nThe Company is primarily exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to its consolidated debt that is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the operations whose cash flows support the ability to repay or refinance such debt. As of June 30, 2022, the Foxtel operating subsidiaries, whose functional currency is Australian dollars, had approximately $345 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness denominated in U.S. dollars. The Company\u2019s policy is to hedge against the risk of foreign currency exchange rate movements with respect to this exposure where commercially reasonable. However, there can be no assurance that it will be able to continue to do so at a reasonable cost or at all, or that there will not be a default by any of the counterparties to those arrangements.\nIn addition, the Company is exposed to foreign currency translation risk because it has significant operations in a number of foreign jurisdictions and certain of its operations are conducted in currencies other than the Company\u2019s reporting currency, primarily the Australian dollar and the British pound sterling. Since the Company\u2019s financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, a currency translation impact on the Company\u2019s earnings when the results of those operations that are reported in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements, which could, in turn, have an adverse effect on its reported results of operations in a given period or in specific markets.\nRisks Related to Information Technology, Cybersecurity and Data Protection\nA Breach, Failure or Misuse of the Company\u2019s Network and Information Systems or Other Technologies Could Cause a Disruption of Services or Loss, Corruption, Improper Access to or Disclosure of Personal Data, Business Information, Including Intellectual Property, or Other Confidential Information, Resulting in Increased Costs, Loss of Revenue, Reputational Damage or Other Harm to the Company\u2019s Business.\nNetwork and information systems and other technologies, including those related to the Company\u2019s CDNs and network management, are important to its business activities and contain the Company\u2019s proprietary, confidential and sensitive business information, including personal data of its customers and personnel. The Company also relies on third party providers for certain software, technology and \u201ccloud-based\u201d systems and services, including AWS, that support a variety of critical business operations. In January 2022, the Company discovered that one of these systems was the target of persistent cyberattack activity. Together with an outside cybersecurity firm, the Company conducted an investigation into the circumstances of the activity to determine its nature, scope, duration and impacts. The Company\u2019s analysis indicates that foreign government involvement may be associated with this activity, and that data was taken. To the Company\u2019s knowledge, its systems housing customer and financial data were not affected. The Company has contained the discovered attack, continues to conduct its analysis and remediate the issue, and to date has not experienced any related interruptions to its business operations or systems. At this time, the Company does not believe the expenses it will incur in connection with its investigation and remediation efforts will be material.\nEvents affecting the Company\u2019s systems or other technologies, or those of third parties upon which the Company\u2019s business relies, such as computer compromises, cyber threats and attacks, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, process breakdowns, ransomware and denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering or other malicious activities by individuals or state-sponsored or other groups, or any combination of the foregoing, as well as power and internet outages, equipment failure, natural disasters, including extreme weather (which may occur with increasing frequency and intensity), terrorist activities, war, human or technological error or malfeasance that may affect such systems, could result in disruption of the Company\u2019s services and business and/or loss, corruption, improper access to or disclosure of personal data, business information, including intellectual property, or other confidential information. Unauthorized parties may also fraudulently induce the Company\u2019s employees or other agents to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to the Company\u2019s systems, facilities or data, or those of third parties with whom the Company does business. In addition, any \u201cbugs,\u201d errors or other defects in, or the improper implementation of, hardware or software applications the Company develops or procures from third parties could unexpectedly disrupt the Company\u2019s network and information systems or other technologies or compromise information security. System redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company\u2019s disaster recovery and business continuity planning may not be sufficient to address all potential cyber events or other disruptions.\nIn recent years, there has been a significant rise in the number of cyberattacks on companies\u2019 network and information systems, and such attacks are becoming increasingly more sophisticated, targeted and difficult to detect and prevent against. Geopolitical tensions or conflicts, such as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, may further heighten the risk of cybersecurity attacks. Greater levels of remote work and access to the Company\u2019s systems may also adversely impact the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s security measures. Consequently, the risks associated with cyberattacks continue to increase, particularly as the Company\u2019s digital businesses expand. The Company has experienced, and expects to continue to be subject to, cybersecurity threats and activity. There is no assurance that cybersecurity threats or activity such as that discovered in January 2022 will not have a material adverse effect in the future. Countermeasures that the Company and its vendors have developed and implemented to protect personal data, business information, including intellectual property, and other confidential information, to prevent system disruption, data loss or corruption, and to prevent or detect security breaches may not be successful in preventing these events, particularly given that techniques used to access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems have become more sophisticated and change frequently. Additionally, it may be difficult to detect and defend against certain threats and vulnerabilities that can persist over extended periods of time. Any events affecting the Company\u2019s network and information systems or other technologies could require the Company to expend significant resources to remedy such event. Moreover, the development and maintenance of these measures is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. While the Company maintains cyber risk insurance, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all losses from any breaches of the Company\u2019s systems and does not extend to reputational damage or costs incurred to improve or strengthen systems against future threats or activity. Cyber risk insurance has also become more difficult and expensive to obtain, and the Company cannot be certain that its current level of insurance or the breadth of its terms and conditions will continue to be available on economically reasonable terms.\nA significant failure, compromise, breach or interruption of the Company\u2019s systems or other technologies, or those of third parties upon which its business relies, could result in a disruption of its operations, including degradation or disruption of service, equipment and data damage, customer, audience or advertiser dissatisfaction, damage to its reputation or brands, regulatory investigations and enforcement actions, lawsuits, remediation costs, a loss of or inability to attract new customers, audience, advertisers or business partners or loss of revenues and other financial losses. If any such failure, compromise, breach, interruption or similar event results in improper access to or disclosure of information maintained in the Company\u2019s information systems and networks or those of its vendors, including financial, personal and credit card data, as well as confidential and proprietary information relating to personnel, customers, vendors and the Company\u2019s business, including its intellectual property, the Company could also be subject to liability under relevant contractual obligations and laws and regulations protecting personal data and privacy, as well as private individual or class action lawsuits or regulatory enforcement actions. The Company may also be required to notify certain governmental agencies and/or regulators (including the appropriate EU supervisory authority) about any actual or perceived data security breach, as well as the individuals who are affected by any such breach, within strict time periods. In addition, media or other reports of actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in the Company\u2019s systems or those of third parties upon which its business relies, even if nothing has actually been attempted or occurred, could also adversely impact the Company\u2019s brand and reputation and materially affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure to Comply with Complex and Evolving U.S. and Foreign Laws and Regulations Regarding Privacy, Data Use and Data Protection Could Have an Adverse Effect on the Company\u2019s Business, Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business activities are subject to various and increasing laws and regulations in the United States and internationally governing the collection, use, sharing, protection and retention of personal data, which have implications for how such data is managed. These laws and regulations are increasingly complex and continue to evolve, and substantial uncertainty\nsurrounds their scope and application. Moreover, data privacy and security laws may potentially conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with these laws and regulations could be costly and resource-intensive, require the Company to change its business practices, or limit or restrict aspects of the Company\u2019s business in a manner adverse to its business operations, including by inhibiting or preventing the collection of information that enables it to target and measure the effectiveness of advertising. The Company\u2019s failure to comply, even if inadvertent or in good faith, or as a result of a compromise, breach or interruption of the Company\u2019s systems by a third party, could result in exposure to enforcement by U.S. federal, state or local or foreign governments or private parties, as well as significant negative publicity and reputational damage. Examples of such laws include the European Union\u2019s GDPR and the UK DPA and UK GDPR, each of which expands the regulation of personal data processing throughout the European Union and the U.K., respectively, and significantly increases maximum penalties for non-compliance, as well as a number of U.S. state data privacy laws, which establish certain transparency rules, put greater restrictions on the collection, use and sharing of personal information of their respective state residents and provide such residents with certain rights regarding their personal information. See \u201cGovernmental Regulation-Data Privacy and Security Regulation\u201d for more information.\nRisks Related to Financial Results and Position\nThe Indebtedness of the Company and Certain of its Subsidiaries may Affect their Ability to Operate their Businesses, and may have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company\u2019s Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The Company and its Subsidiaries may be able to Incur Substantially More Debt, which Could Further Exacerbate the Risks Described Herein.\nAs of June 30, 2022, News Corp had $2.91 billion of total outstanding indebtedness (excluding related party debt) with maturities ranging from fiscal 2023 through fiscal 2032, including $652 million and $281 million, respectively, of indebtedness held by its non-wholly owned subsidiaries, Foxtel and REA Group (collectively with News Corp, the \u201cDebtors\u201d). The indebtedness of the Debtors and the terms of their financing arrangements could: (1) limit their ability to obtain additional financing in the future; (2) make it more difficult for them to satisfy their obligations under the terms of their financing arrangements, including the provisions of any relevant debt instruments, credit agreements, indentures and similar or associated documents (collectively, the \u201cDebt Documents\u201d); (3) limit their ability to refinance their indebtedness on terms acceptable to them or at all; (4) limit their flexibility to plan for and adjust to changing business and market conditions in the industries in which they operate and increase their vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; (5) require them to dedicate a substantial portion of their cash flow to make interest and principal payments on their debt, thereby limiting the availability of their cash flow to fund future investments, capital expenditures, working capital, business activities, acquisitions and other general corporate requirements; (6) subject them to higher levels of indebtedness than their competitors, which may cause a competitive disadvantage and may reduce their flexibility in responding to increased competition; and (7) in the case of the Company\u2019s fixed rate indebtedness, which includes prepayment penalties, diminish the Company\u2019s ability to benefit from any future decrease in interest rates.\nThe ability of the Debtors to satisfy their debt service obligations (including any repurchase obligations) and to fund other cash needs will depend on the Debtors\u2019 future performance and other factors such as changes in interest rates (which have been increasing) affecting the Debtors\u2019 variable rate indebtedness. Although the Company hedges a portion of this interest rate exposure, there can be no assurance that it will be able to continue to do so at a reasonable cost or at all, or that there will not be a default by any of the counterparties. If the Debtors do not generate enough cash to pay their debt service obligations and fund their other cash requirements, they may be required to restructure or refinance all or part of their existing debt, sell assets, borrow more money or raise additional equity, any or all of which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. The Company and its subsidiaries, including the Debtors, may also be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, which could exacerbate the effects described elsewhere in this \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nIn addition, the Debtors\u2019 outstanding Debt Documents contain financial and operating covenants that may limit their operational and financial flexibility. These covenants include compliance with, or maintenance of, certain financial tests and ratios and may, depending on the applicable Debtor and subject to certain exceptions, restrict or prohibit such Debtor and/or its subsidiaries from, among other things, incurring or guaranteeing debt, undertaking certain transactions (including certain investments and acquisitions), disposing of certain properties or assets (including subsidiary stock), merging or consolidating with any other person, making financial accommodation available, entering into certain other financing arrangements, creating or permitting certain liens, engaging in transactions with affiliates, making repayments of certain other loans, undergoing fundamental business changes and/or paying dividends or making other restricted payments and investments. Various risks, uncertainties and events beyond the Debtors\u2019 control could affect their ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants. In the event any of these covenants are breached and such breach results in a default under any Debt Documents, the lenders or noteholders, as applicable, may accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness under the applicable Debt Documents, which could result in a cross-default under other outstanding Debt Documents and could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operation and financial condition.\nThe Company Could Suffer Losses Due to Asset Impairment and Restructuring Charges.\nAs a result of changes in the Company\u2019s industry and market conditions, the Company has recognized, and may in the future recognize, impairment charges for write-downs of goodwill, intangible assets, investments and other long-lived assets, as well as restructuring charges relating to the reorganization of its businesses, which negatively impact the Company\u2019s results of operations and, in the case of cash restructuring charges, its financial condition. Impairments and restructuring charges may also negatively impact the Company\u2019s taxes, including its ability to realize its deferred tax assets and deduct certain interest costs. The Company\u2019s management must regularly evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets expected to contribute indefinitely to the Company\u2019s cash flows in order to determine whether, based on projected discounted future cash flows and other market assumptions, the carrying value for such assets exceeds current fair value and the Company should recognize an impairment. In accordance with GAAP, the Company performs an annual impairment assessment of its recorded goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. The Company also continually evaluates whether current factors or indicators, such as prevailing conditions in the business environment, credit and capital markets or the economy generally and actual or projected operating results, require the performance of an interim impairment assessment of those assets, as well as other investments and long-lived assets, or require the Company to engage in any additional business restructurings to address these conditions. For example, any significant shortfall, now or in the future, in advertising revenue or subscribers, the expected popularity of the content for which the Company has acquired rights and/or consumer acceptance of its products could lead to a downward revision in the fair value of certain reporting units. Any downward revisions in the fair value of a reporting unit, indefinite-lived intangible assets, investments or other long-lived assets could result in additional impairments for which non-cash charges would be required, and any such charge could be material to the Company\u2019s reported results of operations. The Company may also incur additional restructuring charges in the future if it is required to further realign its resources in response to significant shortfalls in revenue or other adverse trends.\nThe Company Could Be Subject to Significant Additional Tax Liabilities, which Could Adversely Affect its Operating Results and Financial Condition.\nThe Company is subject to taxation in U.S. federal, state and local jurisdictions and various non-U.S. jurisdictions, including Australia and the U.K. The Company\u2019s effective tax rate is impacted by the tax laws, regulations, practices and interpretations in the jurisdictions in which it operates and may fluctuate significantly from period to period depending on, among other things, the geographic mix of the Company\u2019s profits and losses, changes in tax laws and regulations or their application and interpretation, the outcome of tax audits and changes in valuation allowances associated with the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets. Changes to enacted tax laws could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s future tax rate and increase its tax provision. The Company may be required to record additional valuation allowances if, among other things, changes in tax laws or adverse economic conditions negatively impact the Company\u2019s ability to realize its deferred tax assets. Evaluating and estimating the Company\u2019s tax provision, current and deferred tax assets and liabilities and other tax accruals requires significant management judgment, and there are often transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.\nThe Company\u2019s tax returns are routinely audited by various tax authorities. Tax authorities may not agree with the treatment of items reported in the Company\u2019s tax returns or positions taken by the Company, and as a result, tax-related settlements or litigation may occur, resulting in additional income tax liabilities against the Company. Although the Company believes it has appropriately accrued for the expected outcome of tax reviews and examinations and any related litigation, the final outcomes of these matters could differ materially from the amounts recorded in the Financial Statements. As a result, the Company may be required to recognize additional charges in its Statements of Operations and pay significant additional amounts with respect to current or prior periods, or its taxes in the future could increase, which could adversely affect its operating results and financial condition.\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) continues to develop detailed rules to assist in the implementation of landmark reforms to the international tax system, as agreed in October 2021 by 136 members of the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework. These rules are intended to address the tax challenges arising from globalization and the digitalization of the economy, including by expanding taxing rights to in-market countries as well as establishing a minimum 15% tax rate for multinational enterprises from 2024. The application of the rules continues to evolve, and its outcome may alter aspects of how the Company\u2019s tax obligations are determined in countries in which it does business. While several jurisdictions have agreed to roll back their digital services taxes by 2023, certain jurisdictions still have separately enacted new digital services taxes. Those taxes have had limited impact on the Company\u2019s overall tax obligations, but the Company continues to monitor them.\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters\nAdverse Results from Litigation or Other Proceedings Could Impact the Company\u2019s Business Practices and Operating Results.\nFrom time to time, the Company is party to litigation, as well as to regulatory and other proceedings with governmental authorities and administrative agencies, including with respect to antitrust, tax, data privacy and security, intellectual property, employment and other matters. See Note 16 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of certain matters. The outcome of these matters and other litigation and proceedings is subject to significant uncertainty, and it is possible that an adverse resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in reputational harm and/or significant monetary damages, injunctive relief or settlement costs that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations or financial condition as well as the Company\u2019s ability to conduct its business as it is presently being conducted. In addition, regardless of merit or outcome, such proceedings can have an adverse impact on the Company as a result of legal costs, diversion of management and other personnel and other factors.\nThe Company\u2019s Business Could Be Adversely Impacted by Changes in Law, Governmental Policy and Regulation.\nVarious aspects of the Company\u2019s activities are subject to regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world, and the introduction of new laws and regulations in countries where the Company\u2019s products and services are produced or distributed, and changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations in those countries, could have a negative impact on its interests. The Company\u2019s Australian operating businesses may be adversely affected by changes in government policy, regulation or legislation, or the application or enforcement thereof, applying to companies in the Australian media industry or to Australian companies in general. See \u201cGovernmental Regulation-Australian Media Regulation\u201d for more information. Benchmarks provided by the Company\u2019s OPIS business may be subject to regulatory frameworks in the U.K. and other jurisdictions. See \u201cGovernmental Regulation-Benchmark Regulation\u201d for more information. The Company\u2019s newspaper publishing businesses in the U.K. are subject to greater regulation and oversight as a result of the implementation of recommendations of the Leveson inquiry into the U.K. press, and the Company\u2019s radio stations in the U.K. and Ireland and its recently launched TalkTV are subject to governmental regulation by Ofcom. See \u201cGovernmental Regulation-U.K. Press Regulation\u201d and \u201c-U.K. Radio and Television Broadcasting Regulation,\u201d respectively, for more information. In addition, increased focus on ESG issues among governmental bodies and various stakeholders has resulted, and may continue to result, in the adoption of new laws and regulations, reporting requirements and policies in the U.S. and internationally, including more specific, target-driven frameworks and prescriptive reporting of ESG metrics, practices and targets. Laws and regulations may vary between local, state, federal and international jurisdictions, and the enforcement of those laws and regulations may be inconsistent and unpredictable. The Company may incur substantial costs or be required to change its business practices in order to comply with applicable laws and regulations and could incur substantial penalties or other liabilities in the event of any failure to comply.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nTheft of the Company\u2019s Content, including Digital Piracy and Signal Theft, may Decrease Revenue and Adversely Affect the Company\u2019s Business and Profitability.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends in part on its ability to maintain, enforce and monetize the intellectual property rights in its original and acquired content, and theft of its brands, programming, digital content, books and other intellectual property affects the value of its content. Developments in technology, including the wide availability of higher internet bandwidth and reduced storage costs, increase the threat of content piracy by making it easier to stream, duplicate and widely distribute pirated material, including from less-regulated countries into the Company\u2019s primary markets. The Company seeks to limit the threat of content piracy by, among other means, preventing unauthorized access to its content through the use of programming content encryption, signal encryption and other security access devices and digital rights management software, as well as by obtaining site blocking orders against pirate streaming and torrent sites and a variety of other actions. However, piracy is difficult to monitor and prevent and these efforts may be costly and are not always successful, particularly as infringers continue to develop tools that undermine security features and enable them to disguise their identities online. The proliferation of unauthorized use of the Company\u2019s content undermines lawful distribution channels and reduces the revenue that the Company could receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of its content. Protection of the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights is dependent on the scope and duration of its rights as defined by applicable laws in the U.S. and abroad, and if those laws are drafted or interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of the Company\u2019s rights, or if existing laws are changed or not effectively enforced, the Company\u2019s ability to generate revenue from its intellectual property may decrease, or the cost of obtaining and maintaining rights may increase. In addition, the failure of legal and technological protections to evolve as piracy and associated technological tools become more sophisticated could make it more difficult for the Company to adequately protect its intellectual property, which could, in turn, negatively impact its value and further increase the Company\u2019s enforcement costs.\nFailure by the Company to Protect Certain Intellectual Property and Brands, or Infringement Claims by Third Parties, Could Adversely Impact the Company\u2019s Business, Results of Operation and Financial Condition.\nThe Company\u2019s businesses rely on a combination of trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade secrets and other proprietary rights, as well as licenses, confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements, to establish, obtain and protect the intellectual property and brand names used in their businesses. The Company believes its proprietary trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights are important to its continued success and its competitive position. However, the Company cannot ensure that these intellectual property rights or those of its licensors (including licenses relating to sports programming rights, set-top box technology and related systems, the NAR License and the Fox Licenses) and suppliers will be enforced or upheld if challenged or that these rights will protect the Company against infringement claims by third parties, and effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country or region in which the Company operates or where its products and services are available. Efforts to protect and enforce the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights may be costly, and any failure by the Company or its licensors and suppliers to effectively protect and enforce its or their intellectual property or brands, or any infringement claims by third parties, could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, results of operations or financial condition. Claims of intellectual property infringement could require the Company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms (if such agreements are available at all), require the Company to spend substantial sums to defend against or settle such claims or to satisfy any judgment rendered against it, or cease any further use of the applicable intellectual property, which could in turn require the Company to change its business practices or offerings and limit its ability to compete effectively. Even if the Company believes any such challenges or claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming and costly to defend and divert management\u2019s attention and resources away from its business. In addition, the Company may be contractually required to indemnify other parties against liabilities arising out of any third party infringement claims.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Common Stock\nThe Market Price of the Company\u2019s Stock May Fluctuate Significantly.\nThe Company cannot predict the prices at which its common stock may trade. The market price of the Company\u2019s common stock may fluctuate significantly, depending upon many factors, some of which may be beyond its control, including: (1) the Company\u2019s quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in its industry; (2) actual or anticipated fluctuations in the Company\u2019s operating results; (3) success or failure of the Company\u2019s business strategy; (4) the Company\u2019s ability to obtain financing as needed; (5) changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles; (6) changes in laws and regulations affecting the Company\u2019s business; (7) announcements by the Company or its competitors of significant new business developments or the addition or loss of significant customers; (8) announcements by the Company or its competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions; (9) changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or the Company\u2019s ability to meet its earnings guidance, if any; (10) the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies; (11) investor perception of the Company and the industries in which it operates; (12) results from material litigation or governmental investigations; (13) changes in capital gains taxes and taxes on dividends affecting stockholders; (14) overall market fluctuations, general economic conditions, such as inflationary pressures or a general economic slowdown or recession, and other external factors, including pandemics, war (such as the war in Ukraine) and terrorism; and (15) changes in the amounts and frequency of dividends or share repurchases, if any.\nCertain of the Company\u2019s Directors and Officers May Have Actual or Potential Conflicts of Interest Because of Their Equity Ownership in Fox Corporation (\u201cFOX\u201d) and/or Because They Also Serve as Officers and/or on the Board of Directors of FOX, Which May Result in the Diversion of Certain Corporate Opportunities to FOX.\nCertain of the Company\u2019s directors and executive officers own shares of FOX\u2019s common stock, and the individual holdings may be significant for some of these individuals compared to their total assets. In addition, certain of the Company\u2019s officers and directors also serve as officers and/or as directors of FOX, including K. Rupert Murdoch, who serves as the Company\u2019s Executive Chairman and Chair of FOX, and Lachlan K. Murdoch, who serves as the Company\u2019s Co-Chairman and Executive Chair and Chief Executive Officer of FOX. This ownership or service to both companies may create, or may create the appearance of, conflicts of interest when these directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for the Company and FOX. For example, potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute that may arise between the Company and FOX regarding the terms of the agreements governing the indemnification of certain matters. In addition to any other arrangements that the Company and FOX may agree to implement, the Company and FOX agreed that officers and directors who serve at both companies will recuse themselves from decisions where conflicts arise due to their positions at both companies.\nThe Company\u2019s Amended and Restated By-laws acknowledge that the Company\u2019s directors and officers, as well as certain of its stockholders, including K. Rupert Murdoch, certain members of his family and certain family trusts (so long as such persons continue to own, in the aggregate, 10% or more of the voting stock of each of the Company and FOX), each of which is referred\nto as a covered stockholder, are or may become stockholders, directors, officers, employees or agents of FOX and certain of its affiliates. The Company\u2019s Amended and Restated By-laws further provide that any such overlapping person will not be liable to the Company, or to any of its stockholders, for breach of any fiduciary duty that would otherwise exist because such individual directs a corporate opportunity (other than certain types of restricted business opportunities set forth in the Company\u2019s Amended and Restated By-laws) to FOX instead of the Company. This could result in an overlapping person submitting any corporate opportunities other than restricted business opportunities to FOX instead of the Company.\nCertain Provisions of the Company\u2019s Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-laws and the Ownership of the Company\u2019s Common Stock by the Murdoch Family Trust May Discourage Takeovers, and the Concentration of Ownership Will Affect the Voting Results of Matters Submitted for Stockholder Approval.\nThe Company\u2019s Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-laws contain certain anti-takeover provisions that may make more difficult or expensive a tender offer, change in control, or takeover attempt that is opposed by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors or certain stockholders holding a significant percentage of the voting power of the Company\u2019s outstanding voting stock. In particular, the Company\u2019s Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-laws provide for, among other things:\n\u2022a dual class common equity capital structure;\n\u2022a prohibition on stockholders taking any action by written consent without a meeting;\n\u2022special stockholders\u2019 meeting to be called only by the Board of Directors, the Chairman or a Vice or Deputy Chairman of the Board of Directors, or the holders of not less than 20% of the voting power of the Company\u2019s outstanding voting stock;\n\u2022the requirement that stockholders give the Company advance notice to nominate candidates for election to the Board of Directors or to make stockholder proposals at a stockholders\u2019 meeting;\n\u2022the requirement of an affirmative vote of at least 65% of the voting power of the Company\u2019s outstanding voting stock to amend or repeal its by-laws;\n\u2022vacancies on the Board of Directors to be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office;\n\u2022certain restrictions on the transfer of the Company\u2019s shares; and\n\u2022the Board of Directors to issue, without stockholder approval, Preferred Stock and Series Common Stock with such terms as the Board of Directors may determine.\nThese provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control of the Company, even in the case where a majority of the stockholders may consider such proposals, if effective, desirable.\nIn addition, as a result of his ability to appoint certain members of the board of directors of the corporate trustee of the Murdoch Family Trust (MFT), which beneficially owns less than one percent of the Company\u2019s outstanding Class A Common Stock and approximately 38.9% of the Company\u2019s Class B Common Stock as of June 30, 2022, K. Rupert Murdoch may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the shares beneficially owned by the MFT. K. Rupert Murdoch, however, disclaims any beneficial ownership of these shares. Also, K. Rupert Murdoch beneficially owns or may be deemed to beneficially own an additional less than one percent of each of the Company\u2019s Class B Common Stock and Class A Common Stock as of June 30, 2022. Thus, K. Rupert Murdoch may be deemed to beneficially own in the aggregate less than one percent of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock and approximately 39.5% of the Company\u2019s Class B Common Stock as of June 30, 2022. This concentration of voting power could discourage third parties from making proposals involving an acquisition of the Company. Additionally, the ownership concentration of Class B Common Stock by the MFT increases the likelihood that proposals submitted for stockholder approval that are supported by the MFT will be adopted and proposals that the MFT does not support will not be adopted, whether or not such proposals to stockholders are also supported by the other holders of Class B Common Stock.\nThe Company\u2019s Board of Directors has approved a $1 billion stock repurchase program for the Company\u2019s Class A and Class B Common Stock, which could increase the percentage of Class B Common Stock held by the MFT. The Company has entered into a stockholders agreement with the MFT pursuant to which the Company and the MFT have agreed not to take actions that would result in the MFT and Murdoch family members together owning more than 44% of the outstanding voting power of the shares of Class B Common Stock or would increase the MFT\u2019s voting power by more than 1.75% in any rolling 12-month period. The\nMFT would forfeit votes to the extent necessary to ensure that the MFT and the Murdoch family collectively do not exceed 44% of the outstanding voting power of the shares of Class B Common Stock, except where a Murdoch family member votes their own shares differently from the MFT on any matter.", "PERMNO": 13964, "SIC": 2711, "TIC": "NWSA"}
