{"cik": "1314772", "company": "Summer Infant, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-17", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the material risk factors described below before making an investment decision. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected, and the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nBusiness Operations and Financial Risks\nThere is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, our securities will have little or no value.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has issued a report on our financial statements at January 1, 2022 that includes an explanatory paragraph referring to our recent losses from operations and negative operating cash flows, which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for the twelve months from the issuance date of those financial statements if we are unable to meet our operating plan or take such actions to increase revenues or reduce expenses to maintain compliance with the financial covenants under our loan agreements or obtain additional financing. As of January 1, 2022 we had $535 of cash, $40,572 of outstanding indebtedness, and borrowing availability of $2,949 under our asset-based loan agreement. We can give no assurances that our losses will not continue in the future or that we will be profitable in the future. Our prior losses have had, and potential losses could have, an adverse effect on our financial condition. We have developed plans to extend our liquidity to support working capital requirements, including among other things: explore price increases where possible, enhance certain supply chain processes and related costs, reduce product costs through re-engineering certain products, reduce discretionary marketing spend to the extent it does not impact revenue performance, obtain additional financing and/or consider strategic alternatives.\nOur ongoing operations may require us to obtain amendments from our lenders under our existing loan agreements or to raise additional funds, and there are no assurances that our lenders will agree to any amendments or that such additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. While we have entered into a definitive agreement with Kids2, Inc. to acquire the Company, the transaction is subject to closing conditions and other risks as described further below. If we are unable to meet our operating plan, obtain necessary amendments to our existing loan agreements if we cannot meet our financial covenants, obtain additional financing, or complete our transactions with Kids2, Inc., and as a result are unable to continue as a going concern, our stockholders would likely lose most or all of their investment in the Company.\nThe concentration of our business with certain retail customers means that changes in the purchasing policies of these customers could have a significant impact on our business and operating results.\nIn fiscal 2021, sales to our top three customers (Amazon.com, Wal-Mart, and Target) accounted for approximately 80% of our total sales, and sales to our top seven customers in fiscal 2021 accounted for approximately 88% of our total sales. We do not have long-term commitments or contracts with any of our retail customers, and retailers make purchases by delivering one-time purchase orders. Therefore, any customer could potentially renegotiate the terms of our business relationship at any time, which could include reducing overall purchases of our products, altering pricing, reducing the number and variety of our products carried and the shelf space allotted for our products, and reducing cooperative advertising or marketing support. Because of the current concentration of our business with these retail customers, a change in our relationship with any of these customers could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we do not appropriately manage our supply chain or maintain sufficient inventory levels, and we are unable to deliver our products to our customers in sufficient quantities or on a timely basis, our operating results will be adversely affected.\nOur business places stringent demands on our inventory forecasting and production planning processes. This inventory management approach may be particularly challenging when combined with \u201cjust-in-time\u201d inventory management systems commonly used by customers to minimize their inventory levels. If we fail to meet tight shipping schedules, we could damage our relationships with customers, incur additional fees charged by our customers and cause sales opportunities to be delayed or lost. In order to meet these deadlines, we may incur additional shipping costs.\nMost of our customers receive our product at our distribution center located in California. To deliver products to these customers on a timely basis, we need to maintain adequate inventory levels of the desired products. Disruptions in our supply chain result in delays in our receipt of inventory, therefore impacting our ability to meet customer demand. We currently face logistical challenges related to the lack of availability of truckers, containers and shippers. These challenges result in significant increases in transportation costs in order to maintain sufficient inventory and directly impact our cost of goods and therefore our margins. These supply chain disruptions have increased as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and we expect them to continue in 2022.\nConversely, at the time we place factory orders, we may not have firm orders from customers or a complete understanding of what consumer demand for those products will be. If our inventory forecasting processes are not accurate, it may result in inventory levels in excess of the levels forecasted and we may not have sufficient space at our distribution center to accommodate excess inventory. As a result, we could be required to record inventory write-downs for excess and obsolete inventory or incur additional expense for storage of excess inventory, which would adversely affect our operating results.\nCovenants in our loan agreements may affect our liquidity or limit our ability to complete acquisitions, incur debt, make investments, sell assets, merge or complete other significant transactions. Deviations from expected results of operations and expected cash requirements could result in a failure to meet financial covenants, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe fund our operations and working capital needs through operating cash flow and borrowing under on our asset-based loan agreement with Bank of America and a term loan agreement with Wynnefield Capital. Because a majority of our suppliers are based in Asia, we generally are paying for product a short time after it has been received in the United States, but we have not generally yet received payment from customers. If our working capital needs exceed our cash flows from operations, we rely on the credit facilities under our loan agreements to satisfy those needs.\nOur loan agreements include certain covenants that place limitations on or restrict a number of our activities, including our ability to incur additional debt, create liens on our assets or make guarantees, make certain investments or loans, pay dividends or make distributions, dispose of or sell assets, or enter into a merger or similar transaction. These restrictive covenants may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our best long-term interests. Any significant deviation in actual results from our expected results of operations, or in the timing of material expenditures from current estimates, any significant business or product acquisitions, or other significant unanticipated expenses could result in us not meeting applicable financial covenants.\nNon-compliance with the covenants in our loan agreement could result in us being unable to utilize borrowings under our credit facilities, a circumstance which potentially could occur when operating shortfalls would most require supplementary borrowings to enable us to continue to fund our operations. If access to our credit facilities is limited or terminated, our liquidity would be constrained, affecting our operations and growth prospects, and we would need to seek amendments to our loan agreements or obtain additional equity or debt financing or face default. There is no assurance that such financing would be available on acceptable terms or at all. Furthermore, any equity financing may result in dilution to existing stockholders and any debt financing may include restrictive covenants that could impede our ability to effectively operate and grow our business in the future.\nWe face risks related to the widespread COVID-19 pandemic that impacted our business in 2020 and 2021 and may continue to impact our business and financial performance and our ability to continue as a going concern.\nIn 2020 and 2021, the global COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken by governments, businesses, and individuals in response to it resulted in significant disruption of the global economy and global supply chains. Such disruption has impacted the market in which we, our employees, customers, suppliers and manufacturers operate and has had and will likely continue to have a negative impact on our business and financial performance. These risks and impacts include:\n\u25cf increased operational risks, including continued global supply chain challenges related to closure of facilities, quarantines and governmental actions; and\n\u25cf increased customer-related risks, including risks of accounts receivable collection, insolvency of retail customers, and delays in payment;\nIn addition to the specific risks to our business noted above, we will also be subject to the long-term effects the COVID-19 pandemic may have on the U.S. economy as a whole. Continued uncertainty regarding the extent the COVID-19 pandemic and the governmental response will likely continue to impact consumer discretionary spending, and therefore demand for our products. In addition to the risks specifically described above, the impact of COVID-19 is likely to implicate and exacerbate other risks disclosed in this Item 1A. The continued uncertainty of the impact of COVID-19 on our business and the global economy may continue to impact our business and financial performance and our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur ability to grow and compete will be harmed if we do not successfully satisfy consumer preferences, enhance existing products, develop and introduce new products, and successfully market and achieve acceptance of our products.\nOur business and operating results depend largely upon providing our customers with products that appeal to the end consumer. Consumer preferences are constantly changing, particularly among parents who are often the end purchasers of our products. Our success largely depends on our ability to identify emerging trends in the infant and juvenile health, safety and wellness marketplace, and to design quality products that address consumer preferences and prove safe and cost effective.\nOur ability to maintain and increase our current market share will depend upon our ability to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and satisfy these preferences, enhance existing products, develop and introduce new products, grow existing distribution channels and seek additional distribution channels for these products, successfully market the products and, ultimately, achieve consumer acceptance of these products. A failure to achieve market acceptance of our products could harm our ability to grow our business.\nAn inability to develop and introduce planned new products or product lines in a timely and cost-effective manner may damage our business.\nIn developing new products and product lines, we have anticipated dates for associated product introductions. When we state that we will introduce, or anticipate introducing, a particular product or product line at a certain time in the future, those expectations are based on completing the associated development, implementation, marketing work, and manufacturing in accordance with our currently anticipated development schedule. Unforeseen delays or difficulties in the development process, significant increases in the planned cost of development, changes in anticipated consumer demand for our products, and delays in the manufacturing process may cause the introduction date for products to be later than anticipated or, in some situations, may cause a product introduction to be discontinued. The risk is also heightened as we look at new alternatives to engineer product functions outside of our core competencies in an effort to provide greater innovation and product differentiation. If we are unable to manufacture, source and ship new products in a timely manner and on a cost-effective basis, it could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nThe intense competition in our market could reduce our net sales and profitability.\nWe operate in a highly competitive market and compete with several large domestic and foreign companies and with smaller producers of infant and juvenile products. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, and greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than us, or have greater e-commerce and social media presence than us. We experience price competition for our products and competition for shelf space at retailers, all of which may increase in the future. In addition, with the acceleration in consumers purchasing online, there is a low barrier to entry into our market for newer, smaller companies that solely operate an e-commerce business. If we cannot adjust to changes in our market and compete successfully in the future, our net sales and profitability will likely decline.\nLiquidity problems or bankruptcy of our key retail customers could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our revenue is with key retail customers. Due to the current pressure on traditional brick-and-mortar retailers, there is increased risk that retailers may suffer material losses or file for a petition for bankruptcy. Sales to retail customers are typically made on credit without collateral. If a customer files for bankruptcy, our pre-petition accounts receivable may not be realized and post-petition orders reduced or cancelled. The bankruptcy laws may severely limit our ability to collect pre-petition accounts receivable. If key customers cease doing business as a result of bankruptcy or significantly reduce the number of stores operated and therefore the amount of products ordered from us, it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, including our ability to access availability under our credit facility.\nBecause we rely on foreign suppliers and we sell our products in foreign markets, we are subject to numerous risks associated with international business that could increase our costs or disrupt the supply of our products, resulting in a negative impact on our business and financial condition.\nWhile most of our sales continue to be in North America, we operate facilities and sell products in countries outside the United States. Additionally, as we discuss below, we utilize third-party suppliers and manufacturers located in Asia to produce a majority of our products. These sales and manufacturing operations, including operations in emerging markets that we have entered, may enter, or may increase our presence in, are subject to the risks associated with international operations, including:\n\u25cf economic and political instability;\n\u25cf restrictive actions by foreign governments;\n\u25cf greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf trade restrictions;\n\u25cf work stoppages or other changes in labor conditions, including due to the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u25cf reduction in business activity in some parts of the world;\n\u25cf currency fluctuations and devaluations;\n\u25cf changes in import duties or import or export restrictions;\n\u25cf compliance with anti-bribery and anti-corruption regulations;\n\u25cf untimely shipping of product and unloading of product through West Coast ports;\n\u25cf complications in complying with the laws and policies of the United States affecting the importation of goods, including duties, quotas, and taxes;\n\u25cf limitations on repatriation of foreign earnings; and\n\u25cf complications in complying with foreign tax laws.\nFuture changes to the U.S. tariff and import/export regulations could have a negative effect on our results of operations. Due to our reliance on manufacturers located in China, from which we currently import a majority of our products, the occurrence of such trade reforms or restrictions could impact our business in an adverse manner.\nAs a result of our international operations, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws, with more frequent voluntary self-disclosures by companies, aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the U.S. Department of Justice and the SEC resulting in record fines and penalties, increased enforcement activity by non-U.S. regulators, and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals. Our failure to successfully comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions that could harm our business and financial condition.\nAlso, because we generate some of our revenue outside the United States but report our financial results in U.S. dollars, our financial results are impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. If the U.S. dollar is strong against foreign currencies, our translation of foreign currency denominated revenue or expense could result in lower U.S. dollar denominated net revenue and expense.\nGeopolitical risks, such as those associated with Russia\u2019s recent invasion of Ukraine, could result in increased market volatility and uncertainty, which could negatively impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe uncertain nature, magnitude, and duration of hostilities stemming from Russia\u2019s recent military invasion of Ukraine, including the potential effects of sanctions limitations, retaliatory cyber-attacks on the world economy and markets, and potential shipping delays, have contributed to increased market volatility and uncertainty, which could have an adverse impact on macroeconomic factors that affect the Company\u2019s business and could amplify the existing supply chain challenges faced by the Company. As a result of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union governments, among others, have developed coordinated economic and financial sanctions packages. As the invasion of Ukraine continues, there can be no certainty regarding whether such governments or other governments will impose additional sanctions, or other economic or military measures against Russia. The impact the invasion of Ukraine, including economic sanctions or additional war or military conflict, as well as potential responses to them by Russia, is currently unknown and they could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, supply chain, suppliers, customers and potential consumer demand for our products. It is not possible to predict the broader consequences of this conflict, which could include further sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, geopolitical shifts and adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions, the availability and cost of raw materials, supplies, freight and labor, currency exchange rates and financial markets, all of which could impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny adverse change in our relationship with our suppliers could harm our business.\nWe rely on numerous third-party suppliers located in Asia for the manufacture of most of our products. While we believe that alternative suppliers could be located if required, our product sourcing could be affected if any of these suppliers do not continue to manufacture our products in required quantities or at all, or with the required levels of quality, and we would incur additional costs if we change suppliers. We may also decide to change suppliers from time to time, which could result in disruption of supply due to the transition of suppliers and other costs associated with terminating supplier relationships. We do not have any long-term supply contracts with our foreign suppliers; rather, we enter into purchase orders with these suppliers. In addition, difficulties encountered by these suppliers in the countries where they operate, such as fire, accident, natural disasters, outbreaks of contagious diseases, or political unrest, could halt or disrupt production at the affected locations, resulting in delay or cancellation of orders. For instance, COVID outbreaks in China may result in delays in manufacturing of our products due to closure of factories and delays in shipping products to the U.S., which could impact our sale forecasts and inventory levels. Any of these events could result in delayed deliveries by us of our products, causing reduced sales and harm to our reputation and brand name.\nIncreases in the cost of materials or labor used to manufacture our products could decrease our profitability and therefore negatively impact our business and financial condition.\nBecause our products are manufactured by third-party suppliers, we do not directly purchase the materials used in the manufacture of our products. However, the prices paid by us to these suppliers could increase if raw materials, labor, or other costs increase. If we cannot pass these increases along to our customers, our profitability will be adversely affected.\nIncreased tariffs, additional tariffs or other import or export taxes on our products could have an adverse impact on the cost of our products, the demand for our products and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe United States and other countries have levied tariffs and taxes on certain goods, including products imported into the United States from China. The majority of our products are manufactured outside the United States, mainly in China, and imported for sale in the United States. Tariffs enacted in 2019 impacted our 2019 and 2020 results and caused market disruption amongst our major customers in 2019. In addition, while exclusions from tariffs were granted for certain of our products in 2019 and 2020, these exclusions have now expired, and while we have applied for further exclusions, there are no assurances they will be granted.\nWhile we have taken actions to mitigate the impact of these tariffs and are exploring alternative sources of supply outside of China, if existing tariffs are increased or if additional tariffs or trade restrictions are implemented by the United States, China or other countries, the cost of our products manufactured in China or other countries and imported into the United States would increase substantially, which would force us to increase the prices of the affected products.\nThere is no assurance that we would be successful in mitigating the impact of increased or additional tariffs, and any increase in pricing to allow us to maintain reasonable margins could adversely affect the demand for those products and may result in decreased profitability and lower sales, thereby having an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nEarthquakes, floods, fire, epidemics or other catastrophic events out of our control may damage or impact the operations of our primary distribution facility and harm our results of operations.\nOur main leased warehouse and distribution center is located in Riverside, California, near major earthquake faults. A catastrophic event, such as an earthquake, flood, fire, or other natural or manmade disaster, could impact operations at this facility. In addition, operations at our distribution facility could be disrupted or required to close if there are any employees who are diagnosed with the coronavirus or there is a governmentally-imposed quarantine or other geographic limitations imposed on companies doing business in California. Any of these events could impair distribution of our products, damage inventory, interrupt critical functions, or otherwise affect our business negatively, harming our results of operations.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities that, if not identified, could negatively affect our consolidated operating results and net worth.\nOur provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by nondeductible equity-based compensation, earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and being higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, transfer pricing adjustments, not meeting the terms and conditions of tax holidays or incentives, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in actual results versus our estimates, or changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof, and taxes relating to deemed dividends resulting from foreign guarantees made by certain of our foreign subsidiaries. For example, in fiscal 2021 we recorded a $1,512 valuation allowance against US deferred tax assets that may not be utilized. In making such determination, we considered all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. In addition, like other companies, we may be subject to examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. While we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from such examinations and the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, there can be no assurance that such provision is sufficient and that a determination by a tax authority will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe could suffer adverse tax and other financial consequences if taxing authorities do not agree with our tax positions, or we are unable to utilize our net operating losses.\nWe are periodically subject to a number of tax examinations by taxing authorities in the states and countries where we do business. We also have significant deferred tax assets related to our net operating losses (NOLs) in U.S. federal and state taxing jurisdictions. Generally, for U.S. federal and state tax purposes, NOLs can be carried forward and used for up to twenty years, and all of our tax years will remain subject to examination until three years after our NOLs are used or expire.\nIn addition, U.S. federal, state and local tax laws, are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. We recognize tax benefits of uncertain tax positions when we believe the positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon a challenge by the relevant tax authority. In fiscal 2020, we took a tax deduction related to a worthless stock loss in connection with the dissolution of one of our subsidiaries, Born Free Holdings Limited. However, because of the uncertainty as to whether this position may be challenged by the U.S. tax authorities, we have determined this tax benefit to be an uncertain tax position and have fully reserved for the tax benefit associated with the deduction. If there are tax benefits, including, but not limited to, the worthless stock loss deduction or our use of NOLs, or other tax attributes, that are challenged successfully by a taxing authority, we may be required to pay additional taxes or we may seek to enter into settlements with the taxing authorities, which could require significant payments or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, we may be limited in our ability to utilize our NOLs to offset future taxable income and thereby reduce our otherwise payable income taxes. Our ability to utilize our NOLs is also dependent, in part, upon us having sufficient future earnings to utilize our NOLs before they expire. If market conditions change materially and we determine that we will be unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future to utilize our NOLs, we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance. Our NOLs are also subject to review and potential disallowance upon audit by the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions where the NOLs were incurred, and future changes in tax laws or interpretations of such tax laws could limit materially our ability to utilize our NOLs. If we are unable to use our NOLs or use of our NOLs is limited, we may have to make significant payments or otherwise record charges or reduce our deferred tax assets, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nA material impairment in the carrying value of other intangible assets could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth.\nA portion of our assets are intangible, which are reviewed on an annual basis and/or whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of these assets exceeds the current fair value, the asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value, resulting in a non-cash charge to earnings during the period in which any impairment is determined. If we make changes in our business strategy, our future operating performance was to fall significantly below forecast levels or if external conditions adversely affect our business operations, we may be required to record an impairment charge for intangibles, which would lead to decreased assets and reduced net operating results and net worth.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our information systems from cyberattacks, which could result in the disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, including personal data, damage our reputation, disrupt our operations and subject us to significant financial and legal exposure.\nWe rely on information technology systems, including systems managed by third parties, across our operations, including for management of our supply chain, sale and delivery of our products, and various other processes and transactions, including credit card processing for online sales. In the course of our operations, we may collect and use confidential customer data and a variety of personal data. A successful cyberattack could result in the theft or destruction of intellectual property, data, or other misappropriation of assets, or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations. Cyberattacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, including wrongful conduct by hostile foreign governments, industrial espionage, wire fraud and other forms of cyber fraud, the deployment of harmful malware, denial-of-service and social engineering fraud. Cyberattacks have become increasingly difficult to detect, and a successful cyberattack could cause serious negative consequences for us, including the disruption of operations and the misappropriation of confidential business information or personal data. Although we devote resources to protect our information systems, we realize that cyberattacks are a threat, and there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent information security breaches that would result in business, legal, financial or reputational harm to us, or would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches or improper access to, use of, or disclosure of personal data could result in significant liability under state, federal and international laws regarding data privacy, and may cause an adverse impact to our reputation and potentially disrupt our business.\nIntellectual property claims relating to our products could increase our costs and adversely affect our business.\nWe receive, from time to time, claims of alleged infringement of patents relating to certain of our products, and we may face similar claims in the future. The defense of intellectual property claims can be costly and time consuming, even in circumstances where the claim is without merit. We may be required to pay substantial damages or settlement costs in order to resolve these types of claims. In addition, these claims could materially harm our brand name, reputation and operations.\nAs a manufacturer of consumer products, we are subject to various government regulations and may be subject to additional regulations in the future, violation of which could subject us to sanctions or otherwise harm our business. In addition, we could be the subject of future product liability suits, product recalls, and other claims relating to the use of our products, which could harm our business.\nBecause we produce infant and juvenile health, safety and wellness consumer products, we are subject to significant government regulation and face product liability risks relating to consumer use of our products. We must comply with a variety of state and federal product safety and product testing regulations. In particular, our products are subject to the Consumer Product Safety Act, the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (\u201cFHSA\u201d) and the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (\u201cCPSIA\u201d), which empower the Consumer Product Safety Commission (the \u201cCPSC\u201d), to take action against hazards presented by consumer products. With expanded authority under the CPSIA, the CPSC has and continues to adopt new regulations for safety and products testing that apply to our products. These regulations have or likely will significantly increase the regulatory requirements governing the manufacture and sale of children\u2019s products and increase the potential penalties for noncompliance with applicable regulations. The CPSC has the authority to exclude from the market and recall certain consumer products that are found to be potentially hazardous. Consumer product safety laws also exist in some states and cities within the United States and in Canada and Europe, as well as certain other countries. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, or if we face product liability claims, we may be subject to damage awards or settlement costs that exceed any available insurance coverage, and we may incur significant costs in complying with recall requirements.\nWe maintain a quality control program to help ensure compliance with applicable product safety requirements. Nonetheless, we have experienced, and may in the future experience, issues in products that may lead to product liability, personal injury or property damage claims, recalls, withdrawals, replacements of products, or regulatory actions by governmental authorities. A product recall could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, depending on the product affected by the recall and the extent of the recall efforts required. A product recall could also negatively affect our reputation and the sales of other products. Furthermore, concerns about potential liability may lead us to voluntarily recall selected products. Complying with existing or new regulations or requirements could impose increased costs on our business operations, decrease sales, increase legal fees and other costs, and put us at a competitive disadvantage compared to other manufacturers not affected by similar issues with products, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. Similarly, increased penalties for non-compliance could subject us to greater expense if our products were found to not comply with such regulations.\nIn addition to product liability risks relating to the use by consumers of our products, we also must comply with a variety of state and federal laws and regulations which prohibit unfair or deceptive trade practices, including dissemination of false or misleading advertising. While we take steps that we believe are necessary to comply with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we will always be in compliance. Compliance with these various laws and regulations could impose significant costs on our business if we fail to comply and could result in monetary liabilities and other penalties and lead to significant negative media attention and consumer dissatisfaction, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to an Investment in Our Securities\nOur stock price has been and may continue to be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile. When we or our competitors announce new products, experience quarterly fluctuations in operating results, announce strategic relationships, acquisitions or dispositions, change earnings estimates, publish financial results or other material news, our stock price is often affected. The volatility of our stock price may be accentuated during periods of low volume trading, which may require a stockholder wishing to sell a large number of shares to do so in increments over time to mitigate any adverse impact of the sales on the market price of our stock.\nOur largest stockholder controls a significant percentage of our common stock, and its interests may conflict with those of our other stockholders.\nWynnefield Capital, through its affiliates, beneficially owns approximately 35% of our outstanding common stock. In addition, a member of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors is an employee of Wynnefield Capital, and in January 2022 the Company entered into a loan and security agreement with Wynnefield Capital. As a result, Wynnefield can exercise significant influence over the Company and over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, changes to our organizational documents and significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership and relationship with Wynnefield makes it more difficult for any other holder or group of holders of our common stock to be able to affect the way we are managed or the direction of our business. The interests of Wynnefield Capital with respect to matters potentially or actually involving or affecting us, such as acquisitions, financings and other corporate opportunities, and attempts to acquire us, may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. Wynnefield Capital has also entered into a voting agreement with Parent pursuant to which they agreed to vote their beneficially owned shares of common stock in favor of the Merger.\nWe may be unable to maintain compliance with the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market which could cause our common stock to be delisted and result in the lack of a market for our common stock, cause a decrease in the value of our common stock, and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to meet the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market for the listing of our common stock, notably, the stockholders\u2019 equity minimum requirement. If we fail to meet the Nasdaq Capital Market\u2019s continued listing requirements, our common stock could be delisted. If our common stock is delisted, we expect prices for our common stock to be quoted on one of the OTC Markets or the OTC Bulletin Board. Under such circumstances, our stockholders may find it more difficult to sell, or to obtain accurate quotations, for our common stock, and our common stock would become substantially less attractive to certain purchasers such as financial institutions, hedge funds and other similar investors. There is no assurance, however, that prices for our common stock would be quoted on one of these other trading systems or that an active trading market for our common stock would thereafter exist, which would materially and adversely impact the market value of our common stock and our stockholders\u2019 ability to sell our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law may limit the ability of our stockholders to control our policies and effect a change of control of our Company and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management, which may not be in your best interests.\nThere are provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws that may discourage a third party from making a proposal to acquire us, even if some of our stockholders might consider the proposal to be in their best interests and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management. These provisions in our certificate of incorporation include authorization for our Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval and to establish the preferences and rights of any preferred stock issued, and to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock that could discourage or delay a tender offer or change in control. Our bylaws require advance written notice of stockholder proposals and director nominations.\nAdditionally, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which, in general, imposes restrictions upon acquirers of 15% or more of our stock.

Inc.\nThe Company will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Proposed Merger is pending.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Merger on employees and third parties (including customers and suppliers) may have an adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company. These uncertainties may impair the Company\u2019s ability to retain and motivate key personnel pending the consummation of the Proposed Merger, as such personnel may experience uncertainty about their future roles and relationships following the consummation of the Proposed Merger. Additionally, these uncertainties could cause customers, suppliers, vendors and others who deal with the Company to seek to change existing business relationships with the Company or fail to extend or maintain existing relationships with the Company.\nThe pursuit of the Proposed Merger and the preparation for the integration of the Company\u2019s business with Parent\u2019s business may place a burden on the Company\u2019s management and internal resources. Any significant diversion of management attention away from ongoing business concerns and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the Merger Agreement restricts the Company from taking certain actions without Parent\u2019s consent while the Proposed Merger is pending. These restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Proposed Merger is subject to conditions to closing that may not be satisfied or waived, including that Parent may not obtain the necessary debt financing set forth in the commitment letters received by Parent in connection with the Merger.\nThe respective obligations of the Company and Parent to complete the Proposed Merger are subject to a number of conditions that must be fulfilled in order to complete the Proposed Merger, including (i) the approval of the Company\u2019s stockholders, (ii) the absence of any governmental order preventing or prohibiting consummation of the Merger or any other transactions contemplated in the Merger Agreement, (iii) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the parties at closing, and (iv) the concurrent closing of a debt financing by Parent to fund the merger consideration. If these conditions are not satisfied or waived, the Merger may not be completed. Parent has entered into debt commitment letters providing for (i) an asset-based credit facility and (ii) a term loan, a portion of the proceeds of which will fund Parent\u2019s obligation to pay the merger consideration at the closing of the Merger. The obligations of the lenders under the debt commitment letters are subject to a number of conditions, including the receipt of executed loan documentation, accuracy of certain specified representations and warranties, and certain pro forma financial conditions. If these conditions are not satisfied or waived, the lenders will not be obligated to satisfy their commitment. While Parent is obligated pursuant to the Merger Agreement to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain alternative financing if the current commitments are terminated or not available, there is no assurance that Parent would be able to secure alternative financing.\nFailure of the Proposed Merger to be completed, the termination of the Merger Agreement or a significant delay in the consummation of the Proposed Merger could negatively impact the Company.\nThe merger agreement is subject to a number of conditions which must be fulfilled in order to complete the Proposed Merger.

In addition, if the merger is not completed by June 30, 2022, either the Company or Parent may choose to terminate the Merger Agreement if the failure to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement by such date is not caused by any breach of the Merger Agreement by the party electing to terminate the Merger Agreement, before or after approval of the Proposed Merger by the Company\u2019s stockholders.\nIf the Proposed Merger is not consummated, the ongoing business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company may be adversely affected and the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock may decline significantly, particularly to the extent that the market price reflects a market assumption that the Proposed Merger will be consummated. If the consummation of the Proposed Merger is delayed for any reason, including by the receipt of a competing acquisition proposal, the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company\u2019s may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the Company has incurred and will incur substantial expenses in connection with the negotiation and completion of the Proposed Merger, as well as the costs and expenses of filing, printing and mailing a proxy statement. Any of the foregoing, or other risks arising in connection with the failure of or delay in consummating the Proposed Merger, including the diversion of management attention from pursuing other opportunities and the constraints in the Merger Agreement on the ability to make significant changes to the Company\u2019s ongoing business during the pendency of the Proposed Merger, could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Merger Agreement may be terminated under various circumstances, and the Company has and will continue to incur fees and expenses in connection with such termination.\nThe Merger Agreement may be terminated under various circumstances by either the Company or Parent if the failure to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement is not caused by any breach of the Merger Agreement by the party electing to terminate the Merger Agreement. For example, the Merger Agreement may be terminated if the Merger is not completed by June 30, 2022, or in connection with a change in the Company Board Recommendation in the event the Board determines that the Company has received an acquisition proposal from a third party which the Board determines constitutes a Superior Proposal, as defined in the Merger Agreement. If the Board makes a change in the Company Board Recommendation, the Company will be required to pay Parent a termination fee of approximately $2.3 million.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that may discourage other parties from pursuing, announcing or submitting an acquisition proposal to the Company that might result in greater value to Company stockholders.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that may discourage a third party from pursuing, announcing or submitting a competing acquisition proposal to the Company that might result in greater value to Company stockholders than the Proposed Merger. These provisions include a general prohibition on the Company from soliciting or entering into discussions with any third party regarding any acquisition proposal or offers for competing transactions, subject to limited exceptions.\nIn connection with entering into the Merger Agreement, Company stockholders holding shares of common stock constituting approximately 53% of the Company\u2019s issued and outstanding common stock have entered into voting agreements with Parent pursuant to which they agreed to vote their beneficially owned shares of common stock in favor of the Merger. The vote of such shares in favor of the Merger would be sufficient to approve the Merger Agreement by the Company\u2019s stockholders under the provisions of Delaware law and the Company\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation.\nLitigation against the Company or the members of the Company\u2019s board of directors could result in significant costs, management distraction, and/or a delay of or injunction against the Proposed Merger.\nMany proposed merger transactions are the subject of shareholder litigation. While the Company believes that any claims that may be asserted by purported shareholder plaintiffs related to the Proposed Merger would be without merit, the results of any such potential legal proceedings are difficult to predict and could delay or prevent the Proposed Merger from being competed in a timely manner. The existence of litigation related to the Proposed Merger could affect the likelihood of obtaining the required approval from Company stockholders. Moreover, any litigation could be time consuming and expensive, could divert management\u2019s attention away from their regular business and, any lawsuit adversely resolved against the Company or members of the Company\u2019s board of directors, could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the actions remain unresolved, they could prevent or delay the completion of the Proposed Merger. One of the conditions to the consummation of the Proposed Merger is the absence of any law or order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) by any court or regulatory authority of competent jurisdiction prohibiting, restricting or making illegal consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including the Proposed Merger). Consequently, if a settlement or other resolution is not reached in any lawsuit that is filed or any regulatory proceeding and a claimant secures injunctive or other relief or a regulatory authority issues an order or other directive prohibiting, restricting or making illegal consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including the Proposed Merger), then such injunctive or other relief may prevent the Proposed Merger from becoming effective in a timely manner or at all.", "PERMNO": 91909, "SIC": 3990, "TIC": "SUMR"}
