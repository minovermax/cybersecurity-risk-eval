Investors should carefully consider the risks described below in conjunction with the other information in this Form 10-K, including our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes. If any of the following risks or other risks which have not been identified or which we may believe are immaterial or unlikely, actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. This could cause the value of our securities to decline and holders could lose part or all of their investment. This section does not describe all risks applicable to us, our business or industry, and it is intended only as a summary of certain material factors.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and the Industry\nOur current and anticipated restructuring actions aimed at shifting our cost structure from high-cost to low-cost markets and realigning our operations with market demand in the paper industry has required and may require significant expenditures in the future and may not be successful.\nBeginning in 2012 and continuing through the present, we have announced and taken various operational restructuring measures in response to changed market conditions in the paper industry triggered by the structural realignment in the demand for the various grades of paper. For example, we have announced the termination of sales agency relationships in Europe, workforce reductions in Germany, the closure of four rolls facilities in Middletown, Virginia, Meyzieu, France, Charlotte, North Carolina and Heidenheim, Germany and the closure of four machine clothing facilities in Warwick, Quebec, Canada, Berazategui, Argentina, Zizurkil, Spain and Joao Pessoa, Brazil. We anticipate pursuing additional cost reduction programs in the future.\nIn connection with these cost reduction measures and with any future plant closures or workforce reductions, delays or failures in the transition of production from a closed facility to our other facilities or the rate of absorption of job assignments by the remaining workforce could also adversely affect our financial performance. We may not recoup the costs of programs we have already initiated, or other programs we may in the future decide to engage in, the costs of which may be significant. In addition, our profitability may decline if our restructuring efforts do not sufficiently reduce our future costs while at the same time positioning us to maintain or increase our sales and gross margins.\nWe have targeted expansion projects where we have identified opportunities for business growth. Our various expansion projects are subject to execution risk and uncertainties that could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn connection with our efforts to realign our manufacturing footprint by either expanding in line with growth opportunities or by closing facilities in high cost regions and transferring production to lower cost regions, we are in the midst of, or have completed, significant expansions of several of our existing facilities. The completion and ramp up of these projects is dependent upon a number of factors, many of which may be beyond our control. For example, we may experience significant delays in completing these projects because we may not be able to acquire appropriate permits. For example, we may encounter unanticipated complications with the installation and implementation of the complex systems and equipment that would impair our ability to begin production within the time frame estimated for the projects. We also may be unable to attract a sufficient number of skilled workers to meet the needs of the new or expanded facilities.\nIn addition, the cost to implement our strategic projects ultimately may prove to be greater than originally anticipated. We have spent significant capital and managerial resources on these new facilities and expansions. Furthermore, our assessment of the projected benefits associated with the construction of these new facilities is subject to a number of estimates and assumptions, which in turn are subject to significant economic, competitive and other uncertainties that are beyond our control. If we incur unanticipated costs in connection with this project, are not able to complete these new facilities in a timely manner or at all, or otherwise unable to achieve the anticipated benefits from this project, our business, results of operations and financial position could be materially adversely affected.\nNew developments and trends in the paper industry could adversely affect our net sales and profitability.\nBecause demand for our products has been driven primarily by the volume of paper produced on a worldwide basis, trends that affect the production level of the paper industry, such as declining demand for newsprint and printing and writing paper due to increased adoption of digital media, will impact our business and financial results.\nWe have experienced, and we believe our industry in general has experienced significant declines in sales to the graphical and newsprint industry. We expect such declines to continue for the foreseeable future, and unless we are successful in increasing our sales to industries other than the graphical and newsprint industry, such declines may adversely affect our net sales and profitability.\nThe profitability of paper producers has historically been highly cyclical due to wide swings in the price of paper, driven to a high degree by the oversupply of paper during periods when paper producers have more aggregate capacity than the market requires. In response to significant changes in the sector and other technological shifts affecting paper consumption, paper producers have continually sought to improve the balance between the supply of and demand for paper. As part of these efforts, they have permanently shut down many paper-making machines or entire manufacturing facilities. Should papermakers continue to experience low levels of profitability, we would expect that further consolidation among papermakers, reducing the\nnumber of paper producers, and shutdowns of paper-making machines or facilities could occur, particularly in Europe and North America, until there is a better balance between supply and demand for paper and the profit levels of paper producers improve.\nGlobal paper production growth in developing markets such as Asia and South America could be moderated by the level of industry consolidation and paper machine shutdown activity that appears to be an underlying trend in developed markets. We have observed a trend that paper producers are focusing on cost reduction strategies and, as a result, are extending the life of roll covers and machine clothing products through additional maintenance cycles before replacing them. New developments and trends in the paper industry, either globally or in a particular region, could cause our paper manufacturing customers to reduce production, cease operations or declare bankruptcy, each of which would adversely affect our net sales and profitability.\nPrice competition in our industry could adversely affect our gross margins and net sales.\nHistorically, we and our competitors have been able to sell machine clothing and roll cover products and services at favorable prices that reflect the value they deliver to customers. This favorable pricing has been particularly derived from our more technologically advanced products, such as forming fabrics, press felts and advanced roll covers. In the event that competition increases due to global economic conditions or continued over capacity in the paper manufacturing industry, we may be required to price our products, in some cases, at levels insufficient to realize our historical gross margins. Such pricing pressure from our competitors might require price decreases or make us unable to affect planned price increases and, thereby, adversely affect our profitability.\nBalancing production levels at our manufacturing facilities could negatively affect our production, customer order time, product quality, labor relations or gross margin.\nAs part of our efforts to reduce our costs, we have attempted to reduce or eliminate excess manufacturing capacity through closure of certain of our manufacturing plants and consolidation of our production. As a result, however, from time to time, our ability to meet customer demand for our products may rely on our ability to operate our remaining manufacturing facilities at or near capacity on an uninterrupted basis. Our manufacturing facilities are dependent on critical equipment, and operating such equipment at or near capacity for extended periods may result in increased equipment failures or other reliability problems, which may result in production shutdowns or periods of reduced production. Such disruptions could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial results. In addition, insufficient manufacturing capacity or other delays may cause our customer order times to increase and our product quality to decrease, which may increase warranty costs and negatively affect customer demand for our products and customer relations generally. Operating our facilities at or near capacity may also negatively affect relations with our employees, which could result in higher employee turnover, labor disputes and disruptions in our operations. On the other hand, if we anticipate or experience a significant decrease in demand for our products, we may choose to temporarily decrease production or idle manufacturing facilities and employees. While decreasing production may mitigate some of the risks of operating at or near capacity discussed above, a significant drop off in production to meet lower demand, including idling facilities or employees, may negatively impact our gross margin.\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates could adversely affect our net sales, profitability and compliance with our debt covenants.\nOur foreign operations expose us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and currency devaluations. We report our financial results in U.S. Dollars, but a substantial portion of our sales and expenses are denominated in Euros and other currencies. As a result, changes in the relative values of U.S. Dollars, Euros and other currencies will affect our levels of net sales and profitability. Currency fluctuations, as they pertain to the Euro, generally have a greater effect on the level of our net sales due to the amount of business we conduct in Euros. An increase in the U.S. Dollar against the Euro generally results in a decrease to net sales and net income. Increases in the U.S. Dollar against other currencies, such as the Brazilian Real, would not impact consolidated net sales as much, as a significant portion of sales in that country is denominated in or indexed to U.S. Dollars, but generally would increase net income as local currency costs would be translated into lower U.S. Dollar expenses for financial reporting purposes. We would expect a similar but opposite effect in a period in which the value of the U.S. Dollar decreases against these currencies. Although in certain circumstances we may attempt to hedge our cash exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, our hedging strategies may not be effective.\nOur industry is competitive and our future success will depend on our ability to effectively develop, market and supply competitive products.\nThe paper-making consumables industry is highly competitive. Some of our competitors are larger than us, have greater financial and other resources and are well-established suppliers to the markets we serve. For example, while we have recently expanded our business in China, we face substantial competition from manufacturers already operating there that are more\nestablished and familiar with the Chinese marketplace. In addition, some of our competitors also manufacture paper-making machines and have the ability to initially package sales of their machine clothing and roll cover products with the sale of their machines and/or to tie the warranties on their machines to the use of their machine clothing and roll cover products. Due to various factors such as price or product innovation by our competitors, our products may not be able to compete successfully with the products of our competitors, which could result in a loss of customers and, as a result, decreased net sales and profitability.\nBecause we have substantial operations outside the United States, we are subject to the economic and political conditions of foreign nations.\nWe have 28 manufacturing facilities in 13 foreign countries. In 2016, we sold products in approximately 62 countries other than the United States, which represented approximately 69.5% of our net sales. Operating in foreign countries presents challenges unique to each country such as in hiring employees, our relations with various parties, including suppliers and governmental agencies, and in production.\nFurthermore, we may decide to do business in countries where we have not previously done business. In such countries, we face the additional uncertainty of entering a new market and its social customs, laws and practices. Should these challenges be realized, our operating results could be adversely impacted and our business or production may be delayed.\nOur foreign operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including risks that:\n\u2022\nforeign governments may impose limitations on our ability to repatriate funds;\n\u2022\nforeign governments may impose withholding or other taxes on remittances and other payments to us, or the amount of any such taxes may increase;\n\u2022\nan outbreak or escalation of any insurrection or armed conflict may occur;\n\u2022\nforeign governments may impose or increase investment barriers or other restrictions affecting our business; or\n\u2022\nchanges in and interpretations of tax policies of foreign governments may adversely affect our foreign subsidiaries.\nThe occurrence of any of these conditions could disrupt our business in particular countries or regions of the world, or prevent us from conducting business in particular countries or regions, which could adversely affect our net sales and profitability. In addition, we rely on dividends and other payments or distributions from our subsidiaries to meet our debt obligations. If foreign governments impose limitations on our ability to repatriate funds or impose or increase taxes on remittances or other payments to us, the amount of dividends and other distributions we receive from our subsidiaries could be reduced, which could reduce the amount of cash available to us to meet our debt obligations.\nEnergy price increases may negatively impact our results of operations.\nCertain of the components that we use in our manufacturing activities are petroleum-based. In addition, we, along with our suppliers and customers, rely on various energy sources (including oil) in our transportation activities. While significant uncertainty currently exists about the future levels of energy prices, significant increases are possible. Increased energy prices could cause an increase to our raw material costs and transportation costs. In addition, increased transportation costs of certain of our suppliers could be passed along to us. We may not be able to increase our prices enough to offset these increased costs. In addition, any increase in our prices may reduce our future customer orders and profitability.\nWe must continue to innovate and improve our products.\nWe compete primarily based on the value our products delivered to our customers. Our value proposition is based on a combination of price and the technology and performance of our products, including the ability of our products to help reduce our customers\u2019 production costs and increase the quality of the paper they produce. Our ability to retain our customers and increase our business depends on our ability to continually develop new, technologically superior products that support our value proposition. We cannot assure that our investments in technological development will be sufficient, that we will be able to create and market new products, that such new products will be accepted by our customers or that we will be successful in competing against new technologies developed by competitors. In addition, either we or our competitors could develop new technologies that increase the useful life of machine clothing or roll covers, which could reduce the frequency with which our customers would need to replace their machine clothing and refurbish or replace their roll covers, and consequently lead to fewer sales.\nWe believe that market recognition of the extended life of our roll cover products and the trend towards new paper-making machine designs which have fewer rolls will continue to negatively impact the demand for our roll cover products.\nWe have seen a trend that paper producers are placing an increasingly strong emphasis on maintenance cost reduction and, as a result, are extending the life of roll covers through additional maintenance cycles before replacing them. Market recognition of the extended life of our roll cover products negatively impacts the demand for these products. In addition, we have seen a trend towards new paper-making machine designs which have fewer rolls, also negatively impacting the demand for our roll cover products. If we are not able to offset these negative impacts on the demand for our roll cover products with growth from new roll cover products, the sale of roll cover products in regions which we believe have high growth potential such as China, or from other sources, the volume of our roll cover sales will be adversely affected.\nThe loss of major customers or the shut down of a mill or mills by one of our customers could have a material adverse effect on our net sales and profitability.\nOur top ten customers generated 26.6% of our net sales during 2016. The loss of major customers, financial difficulties faced by our customers or a substantial decrease in such customers\u2019 purchases from us, for instance through the closure of mills, could have a material adverse effect on our net sales and profitability. Because we do not generally have binding long-term purchasing agreements with our customers, there can be no assurance that our existing customers will continue to purchase products from us.\nWe may fail to adequately protect our proprietary technology, which would allow competitors or others to take advantage of our research and development efforts.\nWe rely upon trade secrets, proprietary know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop new products and remain competitive. If our competitors learn of our proprietary technology, they may use this information to produce products that are equivalent or superior to our products, which could reduce the net sales of our products. Our employees, consultants, and corporate collaborators may breach their obligations not to reveal our confidential information, and any remedies available to us may be insufficient to compensate our damages. Even in the absence of such breaches, our trade secrets and proprietary know-how may otherwise become known to our competitors, or be independently discovered by our competitors, which could adversely affect our competitive position.\nOur success and ability to compete in the future may depend upon obtaining sufficient patent protection for proprietary technology.\nOur patent applications may not result in issued patents, and even if they result in issued patents, the patents may not have claims of the scope we seek. Even in the event that these patents are not issued, the applications may become publicly available and proprietary information disclosed in the applications will become available to others. In addition, any issued patents may be challenged, invalidated or declared unenforceable. The term of any issued patent in the United States is 20 years from its filing date, and if our applications are pending for a long time period, we may have a correspondingly shorter term for any patent that may be issued. Our present and future patents may provide only limited protection for our technology and may not be sufficient to provide competitive advantages to us. For example, competitors could be successful in challenging any issued patents or, alternatively, could develop similar or more advantageous technologies on their own or design around our patents. Also, patent protection in certain foreign countries may not be available or may be limited in scope and any patents obtained may not be as readily enforceable as in the United States, making it difficult for us to effectively protect our intellectual property from misuse or infringement by other companies in these countries. Our inability to obtain and enforce our intellectual property rights in some countries may harm our business. In addition, given the costs of obtaining patent protection, we may choose not to protect certain innovations that later turn out to be important.\nWe may be liable for product defects or other claims relating to our products.\nOur products could be defective, fail to perform as designed or otherwise cause harm to our customers, their equipment or their products. If any of our products are defective, we may be required to recall the products and/or repair or replace them, which could result in substantial expenses and affect our profitability. Any problems with the performance of our products could harm our reputation, which could result in a loss of sales to customers and/or potential customers. In addition, if our customers believe that they have suffered harm caused by our products, they could bring claims against us that could result in significant liability. A failure of our products could cause substantial damage to a paper-making machine. Any claims brought against us by customers may result in:\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s time and attention;\n\u2022\nexpenditure of large amounts of cash on legal fees, expenses, and payment of damages;\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for our products and services; and\n\u2022\ninjury to our reputation.\nOur insurance may not sufficiently cover a large judgment against us or a large settlement payment, and is subject to customary deductibles, limits and exclusions.\nCybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations.\nGlobal cybersecurity threats can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology (\"IT\") systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats. While we employ comprehensive measures to prevent, detect, address and mitigate these threats (including access controls, data encryption, vulnerability assessments, continuous monitoring of our IT networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems), cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include reputational damage; litigation with third parties; diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations.\nWe may be adversely affected if we fail to attract and retain key personnel.\nOur future success depends on the continued contributions of our key senior management personnel, including members of our senior sales staff and research and development team. The loss of services of any one or more of our key personnel might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives and could cause us to incur additional costs to recruit replacements. Each member of our executive management team may terminate his or her employment at any time. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance with respect to any of our executives.\nWe could incur substantial costs as a result of violations of or liabilities under laws protecting the environment and human health.\nOur operations and facilities are subject to a number of national, state and local laws and regulations protecting the environment and human health in the United States and foreign countries that govern, among other things, the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials, discharges of pollutants into the air and water and workplace safety. The U.S. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended, provides for responses to, and, in some instances, joint and several liability for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Environmental laws also hold current owners or operators of land or businesses liable for their own and for previous owners\u2019 or operators\u2019 releases of hazardous or toxic substances, materials or wastes, pollutants or contaminants, including petroleum and petroleum products. Because of our operations, the history of industrial uses at some of our facilities, the operations of predecessor owners or operators of some of the businesses and the use and release of hazardous substances at these sites, the liability provisions of environmental laws may affect us. Many of our facilities have experienced some level of regulatory scrutiny in the past and are or may be subject to further regulatory inspections, future requests for investigation or liability for regulated materials management practices.\nWe cannot assure that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with all laws and regulations applicable to us which are designed to protect the environment and human health. We could incur substantial costs, including clean-up costs, fines and sanctions and third party property damage or personal injury claims, as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws, relevant common law or the environmental permits required for our operations or under workplace safety laws. While we believe that the current level of reserves is adequate, the adequacy of these reserves may change in the future due to new developments in particular matters.\nAdverse labor relations could harm our operations and reduce our profitability.\nWe are subject to risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters because a significant portion of our workforce is unionized. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 2,950 employees worldwide, approximately 13% of whom were subject to protection of various North American collective bargaining agreements and approximately 55% of whom were subject to job protection as members of European or South American trade unions, employee associations or workers\u2019 councils. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 11% of the employees subject to North American collective bargaining agreements (or approximately 1.4% of our total employees) were covered by an agreement that is set to expire prior to December 31, 2017. We cannot be certain that we will be able to renew the collective bargaining agreement set to expire this year, or enter into a new collective bargaining agreement that does not adversely affect our operating results or that we will be without production interruptions, including labor stoppages. In addition, all of our European and South American employees subject to job\nprotection as members of trade unions, employee associations or workers\u2019 councils are subject to arrangements that typically result in higher negotiated or mandated salary increases on either an annual or biannual basis. We cannot be certain that the terms of employment applicable to such employees will not change in the future in a manner which could adversely affect our operating results. We cannot be certain that we will not experience disruptions in our operations as a result of labor disputes or experience other labor relations issues. If we are unable to maintain good relations with our employees, our ability to produce our products and provide services to our customers could be reduced and/or our production costs could increase, either of which could disrupt our business and reduce our net sales and profitability.\nWe may be subject to assessment of income taxes for which we have not accrued any liability.\nWe accrue for certain known and reasonably anticipated income tax obligations after assessing the likely outcome. In the event that actual results differ from these accruals or if we become subject to a tax obligation for which we have made no accrual, we may need to make adjustments, which could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations. For example, taxing authorities may disagree with our tax accounting methodologies and may subject us to inquiries regarding such taxes, which potentially could result in additional income tax assessments against us. In accordance with accounting rules, we do not accrue for potential income tax obligations if we deem a particular tax position, based solely on its technical merits, is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. In making our determination, we assume that the taxing authorities will have access to all relevant facts and information.\nRisks Relating to Our Capital Structure\nOur level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to plan for and react to changes in the economy, our industry or our business and prevent us from meeting our debt obligations.\nWe are significantly leveraged. As of December 31, 2016, our total indebtedness was approximately $524.5 million. Our substantial degree of leverage could have important consequences to us, including the following:\n\u2022\nit may limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, debt service requirements, acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes;\n\u2022\na substantial portion of our cash flows from operations will be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes, including our operations, capital expenditures and other business opportunities;\n\u2022\ncertain of our borrowings, including borrowings under our ABL Facility (defined in \"Management Discussion & Analysis of Financial Conditions & Results of Operations & Credit Facility and Notes\"), are at variable rates of interest, exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates;\n\u2022\nif we seek to refinance our debt or require additional refinancing in the future, we may be unable to do so on attractive terms or at all;\n\u2022\nit may limit our flexibility in planning for, or our ability to adjust to, changes in our business or the industry in which we operate, and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022\nwe may be vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business, or we may be unable to carry out capital spending that is important to our growth.\nDespite current indebtedness levels, we may still be able to incur substantially more debt. This could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial leverage.\nWe may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although the terms of our indenture (\"Indenture\") governing our 9.50% senior secured notes due 2021 (the \"Notes\") will limit, and our ABL Facility limits, our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and, under certain circumstances, debt incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. For example, under the Indenture, we may incur additional indebtedness and certain of such additional indebtedness may be secured, including in the case of additional Notes by a pari passu lien on the collateral, subject to certain conditions. In addition, the Indenture may not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. To the extent that we incur additional indebtedness or such other obligations, the risks associated with our substantial leverage described below, including our possible inability to service our debt, would increase. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Credit Facility and Notes\u201d for a more complete description of the terms and features of the ABL Facility and the Notes.\nThe Indenture to the Notes and the ABL Facility include a number of significant restrictions and covenants that limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nThe Indenture and the ABL Facility include a number of customary and significant restrictions and covenants, subject to certain exceptions, that limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\ndeclare dividends or redeem or repurchase equity interests;\n\u2022prepay, redeem or purchase debt;\n\u2022 incur liens and engage in sale-leaseback transactions;\n\u2022 make loans and investments;\n\u2022 incur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022amend or otherwise alter debt and other material agreements;\n\u2022engage in mergers, acquisitions and asset sales;\n\u2022transact with affiliates; and\n\u2022engage in businesses that are not related to the Company's existing business.\nA breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our Notes and ABL Facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Notes or ABL Facility, the our creditors could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable. If we were unable to repay those amounts, our creditors could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the Notes and ABL Facility. We have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under the Notes and ABL Facility. If our creditors accelerate the repayment of borrowings, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay the Notes and ABL Facility, or borrow sufficient funds to refinance the Notes and ABL Facility. Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms, or terms that are acceptable to us.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. There can be no assurance that our future operating performance will generate sufficient cash flows to support our cash requirements. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. There can be no assurance that we would be able to take any of these actions, that these actions would be successful and permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our existing or future debt agreements, including the ABL Facility or the Indenture. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. Our Indenture restricts our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from the disposition. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or obtain the proceeds which we could realize from them, and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and, as a result our debt holders could declare all outstanding debt to be due and payable; the lenders under our ABL Facility could terminate their commitments to lend us money, declare all outstanding amounts there under due and payable and foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings; and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation, which could result in our security holders\u2019 loss of their investment.\nRisks Relating to Our Notes\nNot all of our subsidiaries are guaranteeing our obligations under the Notes, and the Notes are structurally subordinated to all indebtedness of our non-guarantor subsidiaries.\nThe Notes are guaranteed by each of our existing and subsequently acquired, direct or indirect wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries. Except for such subsidiary guarantors of the Notes, our subsidiaries, including all of our foreign subsidiaries and our subsidiaries that are less than wholly-owned, have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay amounts due under the Notes or to make any funds available to pay those amounts, whether by dividend, distribution, loan or other payment.\nThe Notes are structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other obligations of any non-guarantor subsidiary, even if such obligations do not constitute senior indebtedness, such that, in the event of insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of any non-guarantor subsidiary, all of such subsidiary\u2019s creditors (including trade creditors and\npreferred stockholders, if any) would be entitled to payment in full out of such subsidiary\u2019s assets before we would be entitled to any payment. As a result, the Notes are structurally subordinated to all liabilities of our non-guarantor subsidiaries.\nOur non-guarantor subsidiaries also may be subject to restrictions on their ability to distribute cash to us as a result of law and, as a result, we may not be able to access their cash flows to service our debt obligations, including the Notes.\nOur non-guarantor subsidiaries accounted for approximately $327.7 million or 69.5% of our net sales for year ended December 31, 2016 and $388.5 million or 71.7% of our total assets and $171.3 million or 24.9% of our total liabilities as of December 31, 2016.\nOur ability to make any required payments on the Notes is dependent on the operations of and the distribution of funds from our subsidiaries.\nWe conduct a significant portion of our operations through our subsidiaries. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness, including the Notes, is dependent, to a significant extent, on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Each of our subsidiaries is a legally distinct entity and, while certain of our domestic subsidiaries have guaranteed the Notes, such Note guarantees (the \"Note Guarantees\") are subject to risks. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends and make distributions will be subject to, among other things, the terms of any debt instruments of those subsidiaries then in effect, applicable law and, in the case of our foreign subsidiaries, limitations on the repatriation of earnings. If distributions from our subsidiaries to us were eliminated, delayed, reduced or otherwise impaired, our ability to make payments on the Notes would be substantially impaired.\nThe value of the collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy all the obligations secured by such collateral. As a result, holders of the Notes may not receive full payment on their Notes following an event of default.\nIn connection with the offering of the Notes, the collateral agent under the Indenture and the agent under our ABL facility entered into an inter-creditor agreement pursuant to which (a) the liens on the ABL Priority Collateral (as defined in the Indenture) securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees are contractually subordinated to the liens thereon that secure our revolving credit facility and certain hedge obligations and cash management service obligations; (b) the lenders under our revolving credit facility, such lenders (or affiliates thereof) who are owed such hedging obligations and cash management service obligations will be entitled to receive proceeds from any realization of such collateral to repay their obligations in full before the holders of the Notes will be entitled to any recovery from such collateral; and (c) the liens on the Notes Priority Collateral securing our revolving credit facility are contractually subordinated to the liens thereon that secure the Notes and the Note Guarantees. In the event of a foreclosure, the proceeds from the sale of all of such collateral and the other collateral that secures the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy the amounts outstanding under the Notes (and other obligations similarly secured, if any).\nNo appraisal has been made of the collateral. The value of the collateral is subject to fluctuations and in the event of liquidation will depend upon market and economic conditions, the availability of buyers and similar factors. The collateral does not include contracts, agreements, licenses and other rights that by their express terms prohibit the assignment thereof or the grant of a security interest therein. Some of these may be material to us and such exclusion could have a material adverse effect on the value of the collateral. By its nature, some or all of the collateral may be illiquid, may not have a readily ascertainable market value or may not be saleable or, if saleable, there may be substantial delays in its liquidation. To the extent that liens, security interests and other rights granted to other parties (including the lenders under our ABL facility with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral) encumber assets owned by us, those parties have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the property subject to their liens that could adversely affect the value of that collateral and the ability of the collateral agent under the Indenture or the holders thereof to realize or foreclose on that collateral. Consequently, we cannot assure investors in the Notes that liquidating the collateral securing the Notes would produce proceeds in an amount sufficient to pay any amounts due under the Notes after also satisfying the obligations to pay any creditors with prior claims on the collateral, including in the case of the ABL Priority Collateral, the lenders under our revolving credit facility, if applicable. If the proceeds of any sale of collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, the holders of the Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the collateral securing the Notes) would have only an unsecured, unsubordinated claim against our and the Guarantors\u2019 remaining assets. Bankruptcy laws and other laws relating to foreclosure and sale also could substantially delay or prevent the ability of the collateral agent or any holder of the Notes to obtain the benefit of any collateral securing the Notes. Such delays could have a material adverse effect on the value of the collateral.\nWe will in most cases have control over the collateral, and the sale of particular assets by us could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees.\nThe collateral documents allow us to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income from the collateral securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees, in each case subject to certain limitations. There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the collateral securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the trustee or the collateral agent, including:\n\u2022\na sale, transfer or other disposal of such collateral in a transaction not prohibited under the Indenture;\n\u2022\nwith respect to collateral held by a Guarantor, upon the release of such Guarantor from its Note Guarantee; and\n\u2022\nwith respect to the ABL Priority Collateral that secures our revolving credit facility, if applicable, upon any release in connection with a foreclosure or exercise of remedies with respect to such collateral in accordance with the terms of the intercreditor agreement.\nThe Indenture also permits us to designate any existing or future restricted subsidiary that is a Guarantor or any future subsidiary, whether or not it is a guarantor, as an unrestricted subsidiary. If we designate such a Guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture, all of the liens on any collateral owned by such subsidiary or any of its subsidiaries and any Note Guarantee by such subsidiary or any of its subsidiaries will be released under the Indenture but not necessarily under our revolving credit facility, if applicable. Designation of an unrestricted subsidiary will reduce the aggregate value of the collateral securing the Notes to the extent that liens on the assets of the unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries are released.\nThe lien-ranking provisions set forth in the inter-creditor agreement are expected to substantially limit the rights of the holders of the Notes with respect to liens on the ABL Priority Collateral securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees.\nPursuant to the expected terms of the inter-creditor agreement, the rights of the holders of the Notes with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral are substantially limited. Holders of the Notes may not be able to control actions with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral, including the commencement and conduct of enforcement proceedings against the ABL Priority Collateral, whether or not the holders of the Notes agree or disagree with those actions and even if the rights of the holders of the Notes are adversely affected. Under the inter-creditor agreement, the lenders under our ABL Facility have the sole and exclusive right to exercise remedies with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral for a period of at least 270 days. In addition, such lenders will have rent-free access to, and use of, the Notes Priority Collateral in connection with enforcing their rights against the ABL Priority Collateral for a period of at least 180 days.\nThe pledge of securities (including the capital stock) of our subsidiaries that secures the Notes will automatically be released from the lien on them and no longer constitute collateral when the pledge of such capital stock or such other securities would require the filing of separate financial statements with the SEC for that subsidiary.\nThe Notes and the Note Guarantees are secured by a pledge of the capital stock of subsidiaries held by us and the Guarantors (subject in the case of such subsidiaries that are foreign subsidiaries, up to 65% of the voting stock of such subsidiaries and 100% of their non-voting capital stock) and intercompany notes held by us and the Guarantors. Under SEC regulations in effect as of the issue date of the Notes, if the par value, book value as carried by us or market value (whichever is greatest) of the capital stock, other securities or similar items of a subsidiary pledged as part of the collateral is greater than or equal to 20% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding, such a subsidiary would be required to provide separate financial statements to the SEC. Therefore, the Indenture and the related collateral documents provide that any capital stock and other securities of our subsidiaries will be excluded from the collateral that secures the Notes and Note Guarantees to the extent that the pledge of such capital stock or other securities would cause such companies to be required to file separate financial statements with the SEC pursuant to Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X (as in effect from time to time). As a result, holders of the Notes could lose a portion or all of their security interest in the capital stock or other securities of those subsidiaries. It may be more difficult, costly and time-consuming for holders of the Notes to foreclose on the assets of such a subsidiary that is a Guarantor than to foreclose on its capital stock or other securities, so the proceeds realized upon any such foreclosure could be significantly less than those that would have been received upon any sale of the capital stock or other securities of such subsidiary.\nThe rights of holders of Notes to the collateral securing the Notes may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the collateral and other issues generally associated with the realization of security interests in collateral.\nThe Noteholders' rights in the collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in certain collateral in the future. Applicable law requires that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest, such as real property, equipment subject to a certificate of title and certain proceeds, can be perfected only at the time at which such property and rights are acquired and identified. The trustee and the collateral agent for the Notes may not monitor the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute collateral, and necessary action may not be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired collateral. The collateral agent for the Notes has no obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute collateral or the perfection of any security interest in favor of the Notes against third parties. A failure to monitor such acquisitions and take necessary action may result in the loss of the effectiveness of the grant of the security interest therein or the priority of the security interest in favor of the Notes against third parties.\nIn addition, the security interest of the collateral agent for the Notes are subject to practical challenges generally associated with the realization of security interests in collateral. For example, the collateral agent may need to obtain the consent of third parties and make additional filings. If we or the collateral agent are unable to obtain these consents or make these filings, the security interests may be invalid and the holders of the Notes will not be entitled to the collateral or any recovery with respect to the collateral. Further, the consents of any third parties (such as a lessor whose consent is required for a mineral lease assignment) may not be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such collateral. Accordingly, the collateral agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the collateral may significantly decrease. We are also not required to obtain third party consents in certain categories of collateral.\nThe imposition of certain permitted liens will cause the assets on which such liens are imposed to be excluded from the collateral securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees. There are also certain other categories of property that are also excluded from the collateral.\nThe Indenture permits liens in favor of third parties to secure certain indebtedness, such as indebtedness incurred under our ABL facility, purchase money debt and capitalized lease obligations. Certain of these third party liens will rank senior to the liens securing the Notes and in certain circumstances the assets subject to such liens (e.g., assets securing permitted purchase money debt and capitalized lease obligations) will be excluded from the collateral securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees. In addition, certain categories of assets are excluded from the collateral securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees (e.g., voting stock of a foreign subsidiary that is in excess of 65% of all voting stock of such foreign subsidiary) and the liens on certain categories of assets (e.g., motor vehicles subject to title statutes) are not required to be perfected. If an event of default occurs and the Notes are accelerated, the Notes and the Note Guarantees will rank equally with the holders of other unsubordinated and unsecured indebtedness of the relevant entity with respect to such excluded property and will be effectively subordinated to holders of obligations secured by a lien perfected on such excluded property.\nRights of holders of Notes in the collateral may be adversely affected by bankruptcy proceedings.\nThe right of the collateral agent for the Notes to repossess and dispose of the collateral securing the Notes upon acceleration is likely to be significantly impaired by federal bankruptcy law if bankruptcy proceedings are commenced by or against us prior to or possibly even after the collateral agent has repossessed and disposed of the collateral. Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor, such as the collateral agent for the Notes, is prohibited from repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of security repossessed from a debtor, without bankruptcy court approval. Moreover, bankruptcy law permits the debtor to continue to retain and to use collateral, and the proceeds, products, rents or profits of the collateral, even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given \u201cadequate protection.\u201d The meaning of the term \u201cadequate protection\u201d may vary according to circumstances, but it is intended in general to protect the value of the secured creditor\u2019s interest in the collateral and may include cash payments or the granting of additional security, if and at such time as the court in its discretion determines, for any diminution in the value of the collateral as a result of the stay of repossession or disposition or any use of the collateral by the debtor during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. In view of the broad discretionary powers of a bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict how long payments under the Notes could be delayed following commencement of a bankruptcy case, whether or when the collateral agent would repossess or dispose of the collateral, the value of the collateral at the time of the bankruptcy petition or whether or to what extent holders of the Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the collateral through the requirements of \u201cadequate protection.\u201d Any disposition of the collateral during a bankruptcy case would also require permission of the bankruptcy court. Furthermore, in the event the bankruptcy court determines that the value of the collateral is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, the holders of the Notes would have \u201cunder-secured claims\u201d\nas to the difference. Federal bankruptcy laws do not permit the payment or accrual of interest, costs and attorneys\u2019 fees for \u201cunder-secured claims\u201d during the debtor\u2019s bankruptcy case. Additionally, the trustee\u2019s ability to foreclose on the collateral on the Noteholders' behalf may be subject to the consent of third parties, prior liens and practical problems associated with the realization of the trustee\u2019s security interest in the collateral. Moreover, the debtor or trustee in a bankruptcy case may seek to void an alleged security interest in collateral for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate. It may successfully do so if the security interest is not properly perfected or was perfected within a specified period of time (generally 90 days) prior to the initiation of such proceeding. Under such circumstances, a creditor may hold no security interest and be treated as holding a general unsecured claim in the bankruptcy case. It is impossible to predict what recovery (if any) would be available for such an unsecured claim if we became a debtor in a bankruptcy case. While bankruptcy law generally invalidates provisions restricting a debtor\u2019s ability to assume and/or assign a contract, there are exceptions to this rule which could be applicable in the event that we become subject to a bankruptcy proceeding.\nFederal and state fraudulent transfer laws may permit a court to void the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the liens granted in respect thereof, subordinate claims in respect of the Notes and the Note Guarantees and require Noteholders to return payments received and, if that occurs, Noteholders may not receive any payments on the Notes.\nFederal and state fraudulent transfer and conveyance statutes may apply to the issuance of the Notes, the incurrence of any Note Guarantees of the Notes and the granting of any liens in respect thereof. Under federal bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws, which may vary from state to state, the Notes, any Note Guarantee or any lien granted in respect thereof could be voided as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance if (i) we or any Guarantor, as applicable, issued the Notes or incurred the Note Guarantees with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors or (ii) we or any Guarantor, as applicable, received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for either issuing the Notes, incurring the Note Guarantees or granting any lien in respect thereof and, in the case of (ii) only, one of the following is also true at the time thereof: (1) we or any Guarantor, as applicable, were insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the Notes or the incurrence of the Note Guarantees; (2) the issuance of the Notes or the incurrence of the Note Guarantees left us or any Guarantor, as applicable, with an unreasonably small amount of capital to carry on its business; or (3) we or any Guarantor intended to, or believed that we or such Guarantor would, incur debts beyond our or such Guarantor\u2019s ability to pay such debts as they mature.\nA court would likely find that we or a Guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the Notes, such Note Guarantee or such lien if we or such Guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the Notes or the applicable Note Guarantee or such lien. As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation, property is transferred or an antecedent debt is secured or satisfied. A debtor will generally not be considered to have received value in connection with a debt offering if the debtor uses the proceeds of that offering to make a dividend payment or otherwise retire or redeem equity securities issued by the debtor.\nWe cannot be certain as to the standards a court would use to determine whether or not we or such Guarantor were solvent at the relevant time or, regardless of the standard that a court uses, that the issuance of the Note Guarantee would not be subordinated to our or any Guarantor\u2019s other debt. Generally, however, an entity would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness: (i) the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of all its assets; or (ii) the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or (iii) it could not pay its debts as they become due.\nIf a court were to find that the issuance of the Notes, the incurrence of the Note Guarantees or the granting of any lien is respect thereof was a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, the court could void the payment obligations under the Notes or such Note Guarantees, void such lien or subordinate the Notes or such Note Guarantees to presently existing and future indebtedness of ours or of the related Guarantor, or require the holders of the Notes to repay any amounts received with respect to such Note Guarantees. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent transfer or conveyance occurred, Noteholders may not receive any repayment on the Notes. Further, the voidance of the Notes could result in an event of default with respect to our and our subsidiaries\u2019 other debt that could result in acceleration of such debt.\nAlthough any Note Guarantee entered into in connection with the issuance of the Notes will contain a provision intended to limit that Guarantor\u2019s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its Note Guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer, this provision may not be effective to protect such Note Guarantee from being voided under fraudulent transfer law, or may reduce that Guarantor\u2019s obligation to an amount that effectively makes its Note Guarantee worthless.\nIf we default on our obligations to pay our other indebtedness, we may not be able to make payments on the Notes.\nAny default under the agreements governing our current or future indebtedness, including a default under our revolving credit facility, that is not waived by the required lenders, and the remedies sought by the holders of such indebtedness could prevent us from paying principal, premium, if any, interest on the Notes and substantially decrease the market value of the Notes. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow and are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal, premium, if any, interest and additional interest, if any, on our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants, including financial and operating covenants in the instruments governing our indebtedness (including covenants in our ABL facility and the Indenture), we could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness, including our ABL facility and the Indenture. In the event of such default:\n\u2022\nthe holders of such indebtedness may be able to cause all of our available cash flow to be used to pay such indebtedness and, in any event, could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest; and\n\u2022\nthe lenders under our ABL facility could elect to terminate their commitments thereunder, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets; and\n\u2022\nwe could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nIf our operating performance declines, we may in the future need to obtain waivers from the required lenders under our ABL facility to avoid being in default. If we breach our covenants under our ABL facility and seek a waiver, we may not be able to obtain a waiver from the required lenders. If this occurs, we would be in default under our ABL facility, the lenders could exercise their rights, as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nBecause each Guarantor\u2019s liability under its Note Guarantees may be reduced to zero, avoided or released under certain circumstances, Noteholders may not receive any payments from some or all of the Guarantors.\nThe Note Guarantees by the Guarantors are limited to the maximum amount that the Guarantors are permitted to guarantee under applicable law. As a result, a Guarantor\u2019s liability under its Note Guarantee could be reduced to zero, depending on the amount of other obligations of such Guarantor. Further, under the circumstances discussed more fully above, a court under federal or state fraudulent conveyance and transfer statutes could void the obligations under a guarantee or subordinate it to all other obligations of the Guarantor. In addition, Noteholders will lose the benefit of a particular guarantee if it is released under certain circumstances.\nThe collateral is subject to casualty risks.\nWe intend to maintain insurance or otherwise insure against hazards in a manner appropriate and customary for our business. There are, however, certain losses that may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable, in whole or in part. Insurance proceeds may not compensate us fully for our losses. If there is a complete or partial loss of any of the collateral, the insurance proceeds may not be sufficient to satisfy all of the secured obligations, including the Notes and the Note Guarantees.\nWe may not be permitted to use the funds necessary to finance the repurchase of the Notes in connection with an excess cash flow offer required by the Indenture.\nSubject to certain conditions, the Indenture governing the Notes requires us, within 95 days of the end of each fiscal year, to make an offer to repurchase Notes at 101.5% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest, if any, to the date of purchase with a portion of our excess cash flow for the prior fiscal year; provided that for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017, excess cash flow will be calculated for the five consecutive fiscal quarters ended December 31, 2017. However, restrictions under our ABL facility or other future debt instruments may not allow us to repurchase the Notes in an excess cash flow offer. If we could not refinance such debt or otherwise obtain a waiver from the holders of such debt, we would be prohibited from repurchasing the Notes, which would constitute an event of default under the Indenture. If the indebtedness under our ABL facility is not paid, the lenders thereunder may seek to enforce security interests in the collateral securing such indebtedness, thereby limiting our ability to raise cash to purchase the Notes, and reducing the practical benefit of the offer to purchase provisions to the holders of the Notes.\nThe credit ratings assigned to the Notes may not reflect all risks of an investment in the Notes.\nThe credit ratings assigned to the Notes reflect the rating agencies\u2019 assessments of our ability to make payments on the Notes when due. Consequently, actual or anticipated changes in these credit ratings will generally affect the market value of\nthe Notes. These credit ratings, however, may not reflect the potential impact of risks related to structure, market or other factors related to the value of the Notes.\nOur ability to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control may be limited.\nUpon the occurrence of specific change of control events, we will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest, if any, to the date of repurchase. In addition, lenders under our ABL facility may have the right to accelerate the indebtedness thereunder upon a change of control. Any of our future debt agreements may contain a similar provision regarding the lender\u2019s right to accelerate the indebtedness upon a change of control. However, we may not have sufficient funds at the time of the change of control to make the required repurchase of Notes or repayment of our other indebtedness.\nIf we fail to repurchase any Notes submitted in a change of control offer, it would constitute an event of default under the Indenture which, in turn, would constitute an event of default under our ABL facility and could constitute an event of default under our other indebtedness, even if the change of control itself would not cause a default. Important corporate events, such as takeovers, recapitalizations or similar transactions, may not constitute a change of control under the Indenture and thus not permit the holders of the Notes to require us to repurchase or redeem the Notes.\nNoteholders may not be able to determine when a change of control giving rise to mandatory repurchase rights has occurred following a sale of \u201csubstantially all\u201d of our assets and our restricted subsidiaries\u2019 assets.\nThe definition of change of control in the Indenture includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposition of \u201call or substantially all\u201d of our assets and our restricted subsidiaries\u2019 assets. There is no precise established definition of the phrase \u201csubstantially all\u201d under applicable law. Accordingly, the Noteholders' ability to require us to repurchase Notes as a result of a sale, conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposition of less than all of our assets and our restricted subsidiaries\u2019 assets to another individual, group or entity may be uncertain.\nWe cannot assure Noteholders that an active trading market will develop for the Notes. The failure of a market to develop for the Notes could affect the liquidity and value of the Notes.\nThe Notes are a new issue of securities, and there is no existing market for the Notes. The Notes are not listed on any national securities exchange or quoted on any inter-dealer quotation system. The initial purchasers of the Notes (the \"Initial Purchasers\") have informed us that they intend to make a market in the Notes. However, the Initial Purchasers are under no obligation to do so and each Initial Purchaser may cease its market making activities at any time in its sole discretion and without notice. In addition, the liquidity of any trading market in the Notes and the exchange notes, if any, and any market price quoted for the Notes and the exchange notes, may be adversely affected by changes in the overall market for high-yield securities and by changes in our financial performance or prospects or in the financial performance or prospects of companies in our industry generally. In addition, such market-making activities will be subject to limits imposed by the U.S. federal securities laws, and may be limited during the exchange offer or the pendency of any shelf registration statement. As a result, we cannot assure Noteholders that an active trading market will develop or be maintained for the Notes. If an active trading market does not develop or is not maintained, the market price and liquidity of the Notes may be adversely affected. In that case Noteholders may not be able to sell their Notes at a particular time or they may not be able to sell their Notes at a favorable price.\nThe market price for the Notes may be volatile.\nHistorically, the market for non-investment grade debt has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The market for the Notes, if any, may be subject to similar disruptions. Any such disruptions may adversely affect the value of the Notes. In addition, subsequent to their initial issuance, the Notes may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for similar Notes, our performance and other factors.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nWe do not anticipate paying a dividend on our common stock in the foreseeable future, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur ABL Facility and the Indenture governing our Notes limits the payment of dividends on our common stock. Accordingly, we do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. The lack of dividend payments may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock has been volatile since our initial public offering and may continue to be volatile.\nShares of our common stock may continue to experience substantial price volatility, including significant decreases, in response to a number of events, including:\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by principal stockholders;\n\u2022\nour quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\nissuances of our common stock;\n\u2022\nfuture announcements concerning our business;\n\u2022\nour dividend policy;\n\u2022\nthe failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock and/or changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nactions of competitors;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nchanges in U.S. and foreign government regulation;\n\u2022\ngeneral market, economic and political conditions; and\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, terrorist attacks and acts of war.\nOn December 31, 2016, the last trading day in 2016, the closing price of our common stock was $5.62 as compared with $11.85 as of December 31, 2015. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, the lowest trading price of our common stock was $4.26 and the highest trading price was $12.23.\nSome companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have had securities class action lawsuits filed against them. Such lawsuits, should they be filed against us in the future, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCertain shareholders have significant influence over our business and significant transactions.\nWe have a director nomination agreement with Carl Marks Strategic Investments, LP (together with its affiliates, \"Carl Marks\") pursuant to which Carl Marks may designate one individual for nomination to our Board of Directors, so long as Carl Marks continues to own at least 50% of the common stock issued to them under the plan of reorganization in connection with our bankruptcy in 2010. As of February 28, 2017, Carl Marks owned 13.1% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Mr. Wilson, who is a general partner of Carl Marks Management Company, is also our Chairman of the Board. As a result, Carl Marks has a strong ability to influence our business, policies and affairs, and we cannot be certain that their interests will be consistent with the interests of other holders of our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us.\nOur Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to one million shares of preferred stock (of which 20,000 shares have been designated as Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock) and to determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting rights, of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders.\nThe rights of the holders of our common stock may be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future. The issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control of our company without further action by the stockholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock. For instance, we previously adopted a shareholder rights plan, which has since lapsed, that if implemented could have substantially diluted the stock ownership of a person or group attempting to take us over without the approval of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors could choose to adopt a stockholder rights plan in the future that may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire us (or a significant percentage of our outstanding capital stock) without first negotiating with our Board of Directors regarding that acquisition.\nFurther, some provisions of our charter documents, including provisions eliminating the ability of stockholders to take action by written consent and limiting the ability of stockholders to raise matters at a meeting of stockholders without giving advance notice, may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management of our company, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our stock. In addition, our charter documents do not permit cumulative voting, which may make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our Board of Directors. Further, we are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which will prohibit us from engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, even if such combination is favored by a majority of stockholders, unless the business\ncombination is approved in a prescribed manner. The application of Section 203 also could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company.\nIf securities or industry analysts downgrade our common shares or publish misleading or unfavorable research about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common shares is influenced in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts downgrades our shares or publishes misleading or unfavorable research about our business, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our Company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our shares could decrease, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nWe are exposed to risks relating to evaluations of our internal controls required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results. We are required to provide reliable financial statements and reports to our shareholders. To monitor the accuracy and reliability of our financial reporting, we have established an internal audit function that oversees our internal controls. In addition, we have developed policies and procedures with respect to company-wide business processes and cycles in order to implement effective internal control over financial reporting. While we have undertaken substantial work to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we cannot be certain that we will be successful in maintaining effective internal control over our financial reporting and may determine in the future that our existing internal controls need improvement. If we fail to comply with proper overall controls, we could be materially harmed or fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, the existence of a material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal controls could result in errors in our financial statements that could require a restatement, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, result in increased costs to remediate any deficiencies, attract regulatory scrutiny or lawsuits and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, leading to a substantial decline in the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 90700, "SIC": 3550, "TIC": "XRM"}
