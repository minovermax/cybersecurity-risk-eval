Risk Factors\nLike all financial companies, the Company\u2019s business and results of operations are subject to a number of risks, many of which are outside of our control. In addition to the other information in this report, readers should carefully consider that the following important factors could materially impact our business and future results of operations.\nEconomic, Political and Market Risks\nChanges in national and local economic and political conditions could adversely affect our earnings through declines in deposits, quality of investment securities, loan demand, and our borrowers\u2019 ability to repay loans, and the value of the collateral securing our loans.\nOur success depends, in part, on local and national economic and political conditions, as well as governmental fiscal and monetary policies. Conditions such as inflation, recession, unemployment, changes in interest rates, fiscal and monetary policy, tariffs, a United States withdrawal from a significant renegotiation of trade agreements, trade wars, the election of a new United States President in 2020, and other factors beyond our control may adversely affect our deposit levels and composition, the quality of our assets including investment securities available for purchase, and the demand for loans, which, in turn, may adversely affect our earnings and capital. Since substantially all of our loans are to individuals and businesses in Ohio, any decline in the economy of this market area could have a materially adverse effect on our credit risk and on our deposit and loan levels. In addition, such conditions may adversely affect the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans and the value of collateral securing the loans, which could adversely affect our earnings. Changes in government, including the election of a new United States President in 2020, could bring changes in all of such factors. Economic turmoil in Europe and Asia, trade negotiations and wars, and changes in oil production in the Middle East affect the economy and stock prices in the United States. The timing and circumstances of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union (Brexit) and their effects on the U.S. are unknown. Because we have a significant number of real estate loans, a decline in the value of real estate could have a material adverse effect on us. As of December 31, 2019, 78.2% of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial, commercial real estate, real estate construction and installment, all of which are generally viewed as having more risk of default than residential real estate loans and all of which, with the exception of installment loans, are typically larger than residential real estate loans. Residential real estate loans held in the portfolio are typically originated using conservative underwriting standards that do not include sub-prime lending.\nAdverse changes in the financial markets may adversely impact our results of operations.\nWhile we generally invest in securities issued by U.S. government agencies and sponsored entities and U.S. state and local governments with limited credit risk, certain investment securities we hold possess higher credit risk since they represent beneficial interests in structured investments collateralized by residential mortgages, debt obligations and other similar asset-backed assets. Regardless of the level of credit risk, all investment securities are subject to changes in market value due to changing interest rates, implied credit spreads and credit ratings.\nChanges in interest rates could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur results of operations depend substantially on our net interest income, which is the difference between: (1) the interest earned on loans, securities and other interest-earning assets; and (2) the interest paid on deposits and borrowings. These rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions, inflation, recession, unemployment, money supply and the policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities, particularly those of the Federal Reserve Board. If the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings increases at a faster rate than the interest we receive on loans and other investments, our net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest we receive on loans and other investments falls more quickly than the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings. While we have taken measures intended to manage the risks of operating in a changing interest rate environment, there can be no assurance that these measures will be effective in avoiding undue interest rate risk.\nIncreases in interest rates can also affect the value of loans and other assets, including our ability to realize gains on the sale of assets. We originate loans for sale and for our portfolio. Increasing interest rates may reduce the origination of loans for sale and consequently the fee income we earn on such sales. Further, increasing interest rates may adversely affect the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans and leases, resulting in an increase in non-performing assets and a reduction of income recognized.\nA transition away from London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as a reference rate for financial contracts could negatively affect our income and expenses and the value of various financial contracts.\nLIBOR is used extensively in the U.S. and globally as a benchmark for various commercial and financial contracts, including adjustable rate mortgages, corporate debt, interest rate swaps and other derivatives. LIBOR is set based on interest rate information reported by certain banks, which may stop reporting such information after 2021. It is uncertain at this time whether LIBOR will change or cease to exist or the extent to which those entering into financial contracts will transition to any other particular benchmark. Other benchmarks may perform differently than LIBOR or alternative benchmarks have performed in the past or have other consequences that cannot currently be anticipated. It is also uncertain what will happen with instruments that rely on LIBOR for future interest rate adjustments and which remain outstanding if LIBOR ceases to exist.\nCurrently approximately 15% of the Company\u2019s loans are floating on a LIBOR index. When a LIBOR substitute becomes effective, our existing notes with those borrowers allow a conversion to another index. We are uncertain as to the performance of any substitute index compared to LIBOR and, therefore, cannot project any financial consequence to such conversion.\nOperational Risks\nThe Company has operational risk.\nThe Company has many types of operational risk, including those discussed in more detail elsewhere in this Risk Factors section, such as cyber-related risks, insufficient allowances for loan losses, errors in estimates in the preparation of financial statements, and risks related to future expansion. The Company also has reputational risk, legal and compliance risk, the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders and unauthorized transactions by employees, and operational errors, including clerical or record-keeping errors and errors resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems.\nThe Company's operations may be disrupted by events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, including computer viruses, cyber-attacks, spikes in transaction volume or customer activity, electrical or telecommunications outages or natural disasters. If our policies and systems designed to mitigate such problems fail to operate well, such failures could result in reputational damage, regulatory intervention and civil litigation, leading to financial loss or liability. Negative public opinion could result from the Company's actual or alleged conduct with respect to a variety of its activities, including lending practices, corporate governance and acquisitions. Negative public opinion can adversely affect the Company's ability to attract and retain customers.\nThe Company relies on vendors for certain processes. The Company is exposed to the risk that its vendors may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations or will suffer from the same risks as the Company has and that their business continuity systems may be inadequate, resulting in damage to the Company's reputation, loss of business, regulatory enforcement actions and civil litigation.\nFailures or material breaches in security of our systems or those of third-party service providers may have a significant effect on our business.\nWe collect, process and store sensitive consumer data by utilizing computer systems and telecommunications networks operated by both us and third-party service providers. The Bank\u2019s necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process the Bank\u2019s transactions poses the risk that technical system flaws, employee errors, tampering or manipulation of those systems, or attacks by third parties will result in losses and may be difficult to detect. We have security and backup and recovery systems in place, as well as a business continuity plan, to ensure the computer systems will not be inoperable, to the extent possible. We also routinely review documentation of such controls and backups related to third-party service providers. Our inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact the timeliness and efficiency of our business operations. In recent years, several banks have experienced denial of service attacks in which individuals or organizations flood the bank's website with extraordinarily high volumes of traffic, with the goal and effect of disrupting the ability of the bank to process transactions. Other businesses have been victims of ransomware attacks in which the business becomes unable to access its own information and is presented with a demand to pay a ransom in order to once again have access to its information. We could be adversely affected if one of our employees causes a significant operational break-down or failure, either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates our operations or systems. We may not be able to prevent employee errors or misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect this type of activity might prove ineffective. The Bank is further exposed to the risk that the third-party service providers may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations (or will be subject to the same risks as the Bank). These disruptions may interfere with service to the Bank\u2019s customers. We are also at risk of the impact of natural disasters, terrorism and international hostilities on our systems or for the effects of outages or other failures involving power or communications systems operated by others.\nIn addition, there have been instances where financial institutions have been victims of fraudulent activity in which criminals pose as customers to initiate wire and automated clearinghouse transactions out of customer accounts. The recent massive breach of the systems of a credit bureau presents additional threats as criminals now have more information than ever before about a larger portion of our country's population, which could be used by criminals to pose as customers initiating transfers of money from customer accounts. Although we have policies and procedures in place to verify the authenticity of our customers, we cannot assure that such policies and procedures will prevent all fraudulent transfers.\nWe have implemented security controls to prevent unauthorized access to our computer systems, and we require that our third-party service providers maintain similar controls. However, management cannot be certain that these measures will be successful. A security breach of the computer systems and loss of confidential information, such as customer account numbers and related information, could result in a loss of customers\u2019 confidence and, thus, loss of business. We could also lose revenue if competitors gain access to confidential information about our business operations and use it to compete with us.\nFurther, we may be affected by data breaches at retailers and other third parties who participate in data interchanges with us and our customers that involve the theft of customer credit and debit card data, which may include the theft of our debit card PIN numbers and commercial card information used to make purchases at such retailers and other third parties. Such data breaches could result in us incurring significant expenses to reissue debit cards and cover losses, which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur assets at risk for cyber-attacks include financial assets and non-public information belonging to customers. We use several third-party vendors who have access to our assets via electronic media. Certain cyber security risks arise due to this access, including cyber espionage, blackmail, ransom, and theft.\nAll of the types of cyber incidents discussed above could result in damage to our reputation, loss of customer business, costs of incentives to customers or business partners in order to maintain their relationships, litigation, increased regulatory scrutiny and potential enforcement actions, repairs of system damage, increased investments in cybersecurity (such as obtaining additional technology, making organizational changes, deploying additional personnel, training personnel and engaging consultants), increased insurance premiums, and loss of investor confidence and a reduction in our stock price, all of which could result in financial loss and material adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur allowance for loan losses may be insufficient.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses to provide for probable loan losses based on management\u2019s quarterly analysis of the loan portfolio. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) requires management to make significant estimates that affect the financial statements. One of our most critical estimates is the level of the allowance for loan losses. Due to the inherent nature of these estimates, we cannot provide absolute assurance that we will not be required to charge earnings for significant unexpected loan losses. For more information on the sensitivity of these estimates, refer to the discussion of our \u201cCritical Accounting Policies\u201d in this Form 10-K.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses that we believe is a reasonable estimate of known and inherent losses within the loan portfolio. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans. In deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and counterparties, we may rely on information provided to us by customers and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. We may also rely on representations of customers and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. For example, in deciding whether to extend credit to a business, we may assume that the customer\u2019s audited financial statements conform with GAAP and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the customer. We may also rely on the audit report covering those financial statements. Our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted to the extent that we rely on financial statements that do not comply with GAAP or on financial statements and other financial information that are materially misleading.\nThrough a periodic review and consideration of the loan portfolio, management determines the amount of the allowance for loan losses by considering general market conditions, credit quality of the loan portfolio, the collateral supporting the loans and performance of customers relative to their financial obligations with us. The amount of future losses is susceptible to changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in interest rates, which may be beyond our control, and these losses may exceed current estimates. We cannot fully predict the amount or timing of losses or whether the loss allowance will be adequate in the future. If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions that could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, federal and state regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses as part of their examination process and may require management to increase the allowance or recognize further loan charge-offs based on judgments different than those of management. Any increase in the provision for loan losses would decrease our pre-tax and net income. Moreover, the Financial Accounting Standards Board has changed its requirements for establishing the allowance for loan losses. The new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods and interim reporting periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2019. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this accounting guidance on the Bank's allowance for loan losses.\nWhen we loan money, we incur a risk of losses if our borrowers do not repay their loans.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit, we may rely on information provided by or on behalf of our borrowers, including financial statements and other financial information. Although we regularly review our credit exposure to specific clients, as well as industries, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that we have not detected, such as fraud. We may also fail to receive full information with respect to the risks of a borrower. In addition, when we have extended credit against collateral, such collateral could prove inadequate, such as when there are sudden declines in market value of the collateral or due to fraud with respect to such collateral. If such events occur, it could result in loss of revenue and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we foreclose on collateral property and own the underlying real estate, we may be subject to the increased costs associated with the ownership of real property, resulting in reduced revenues.\nWe may have to foreclose on collateral property to protect our investment and may thereafter own and operate such property, in which case we will be exposed to the risks inherent in the ownership of real estate. The amount that we, as a mortgagee, may realize after a default is dependent upon factors outside of our control, including, but not limited to: (i) general or local economic conditions; (ii) neighborhood values; (iii) interest rates; (iv) real estate tax rates; (v) operating expenses of the mortgaged properties; (vi) supply of and demand for rental units or properties; (vii) ability to obtain and maintain adequate occupancy of the properties; (viii) zoning laws; (ix) governmental rules, regulations and fiscal policies; and (x) acts of God. Certain expenditures associated with the ownership of real estate, principally real estate taxes and maintenance costs, may adversely affect the income from the real estate. Therefore, the cost of operating a real property may exceed the rental income earned from such property, and we may have to advance funds in order to protect our investment, or we may be required to dispose of the real property at a loss. The foregoing expenditures and costs could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues, resulting in reduced levels of profitability.\nEnvironmental liability associated with commercial lending could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the course of our business, we may acquire, through foreclosure, commercial properties securing loans that are in default. There is a risk that hazardous substances could be discovered on those properties. In this event, we could be required to remove the substances from and remediate the properties at our cost and expense. The cost of removal and environmental remediation could be substantial. We may not have adequate remedies against the owners of the properties or other responsible parties and could find it difficult or impossible to sell the affected properties. These events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.\nThe Bank may be required to repurchase loans it has sold or indemnify loan purchasers under the terms of the sale agreements, which could adversely affect the Company's liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nWhen the Bank sells a mortgage loan, it may agree to repurchase or substitute a mortgage loan if it is later found to have breached any representation or warranty the Bank made about the loan or if the borrower is later found to have committed fraud in connection with the origination of the loan. The Bank's underwriting policies and procedures may not prevent every breach or fraud. Repurchases or indemnifications may have an adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may lose business due to trends of consumers deciding not to use banks to complete financial transactions or depositing funds electronically with banks outside of our market area, which could negatively affect our net financial condition and results of operations.\nTechnology and other changes allow parties to complete financial transactions without banks. For example, consumers can pay bills and transfer funds directly without banks. Consumers can also shop for higher deposit interest rates at banks across the country, which may offer higher rates because they have few or no physical branches and open deposit accounts electronically. Further, consumers can now maintain funds in brokerage accounts or mutual funds that in the past have been held as deposits. These processes could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of client deposits and the income generated from those deposits, in addition to increasing our funding costs.\nWe operate in an extremely competitive market, and our business will suffer if we are unable to compete effectively.\nIn our market area, we encounter significant competition from other banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, mortgage banking firms, securities brokerage firms, asset management firms and insurance companies. The increasingly competitive environment is a result primarily of changes in regulation and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial service providers. The Company is smaller than many of our competitors. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits and may offer services that we do not or cannot provide. The OCC has recently announced that it will accept applications for national bank charters from non-depository financial technology companies engaged in banking activities. Another increasingly competitive factor in the financial services industry is the competition to attract and retain talented employees, resulting in increased expenses.\nWe may not be able to adapt to technological change.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers while reducing costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address customer needs by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological changes affecting the financial services industry could negatively affect our growth, revenue and profit.\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.\nManagement\u2019s accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Our management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods in order to ensure that they comply with GAAP and reflect management\u2019s judgment as to the most appropriate manner in which to record and report our financial condition and results of operations. One of the most critical estimates is the level of the allowance of loan losses. Due to the inherent nature of these estimates, we cannot provide absolute assurance that we will not significantly increase the allowance for loan losses or sustain loan losses that are significantly higher than the provided allowance.\nIncreases in FDIC insurance premiums may have a material adverse effect on our earnings.\nWe are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance. If there are a significant number of financial institution failures or changes in the method of calculating premiums, we may be required to pay higher FDIC premiums. Increases in FDIC insurance premiums may materially adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to continue to pay dividends on our common shares at the current rate or at all.\nThe loss of key members of our senior management team could adversely affect our business.\nWe believe that our success depends largely on the efforts and abilities of our senior management. Their experience and industry contacts significantly benefit us. In addition, our success depends in part upon senior management\u2019s ability to implement our business strategy. The competition for qualified personnel in the financial services industry is intense, and the loss of services of any of our senior executive officers or an inability to continue to attract, retain and motivate key personnel could adversely affect our business. We cannot be sure that we will be able to retain our existing key personnel or attract additional qualified personnel.\nLoss of key employees may disrupt relationships with certain customers.\nOur business is primarily relationship-driven in that many of our key employees have extensive customer relationships. Loss of a key employee with such customer relationships may lead to the loss of business if the customers were to follow that employee to a competitor. While we believe that we have strong relationships with our key producers, we cannot guarantee that all of our key personnel will remain with our organization. Loss of such key personnel, should they enter into an employment relationship with one of our competitors, could result in a loss of customers.\nOur ability to pay cash dividends is limited.\nWe are dependent primarily upon the earnings of our operating subsidiaries for funds to pay dividends on our common shares. The payment of dividends by us and our subsidiaries is subject to certain regulatory restrictions. As a result, any payment of dividends in the future will be dependent, in large part, on our ability to satisfy these regulatory restrictions and our subsidiaries\u2019 earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors. Although our financial earnings and financial condition have allowed us to declare and pay periodic cash dividends to our shareholders in the past, there can be no assurance that our dividend policy or size of dividend distribution will continue in the future.\nTrading in our common shares is very limited, which may adversely affect the time and the price at which our shareholders can sell their common shares.\nAlthough the common shares of the Company are quoted on the NASDAQ Market, trading in the Company\u2019s common shares is limited, and the bid/ask spread is often wide.\nAs a result, you may be unable to purchase our common shares at the volume, price or time you desire. The limited trading market for our common shares may cause fluctuations in the market value of our common shares to be exaggerated, leading to price volatility in excess of that which would occur in a more active trading market. In addition, even if our common shares develop a more active market, we cannot be sure that such a market will continue.\nFactors that may affect the volatility of our stock include:\n\u2022\nour actual or anticipated operating and financial results, including how those results vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts or actions taken by rating agencies with respect to other financial institution;\n\u2022\nfailure to declare dividends on our common stock from time to time;\n\u2022\nreports in the press or investment community generally or relating to our reputation or the financial services industry;\n\u2022\ndevelopments in our business or operations or in the financial sector generally;\n\u2022\nany future offerings by us of our common stock;\n\u2022\nlegislative or regulatory changes affecting our industry generally or our business and operations specifically;\n\u2022\nthe operating and stock price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to us;\n\u2022\nannouncements of strategic developments, acquisitions, restructurings, dispositions, financings and other material events by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nexpectations of (or actual) equity dilution, including the actual or expected dilution to various financial measures, including earnings per share, that may be caused by this offering;\n\u2022\nactions by our current shareholders, including future sales of common shares by existing shareholders, including our directors and executive officers;\n\u2022\nproposed or final regulatory changes or developments;\n\u2022\nanticipated or pending regulatory investigations, proceedings, or litigation that may involve or affect us; and\n\u2022\nother changes in U.S. or global financial markets, global economies and general market conditions, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, stock, commodity, credit or asset valuations or volatility.\nOur organizational documents may have the effect of discouraging a third party from acquiring us.\nOur articles of incorporation and code of regulations contain provisions, including a staggered board of directors and a supermajority vote requirement, that make it more difficult for a third party to gain control or acquire us without the consent of the board of directors. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and may make it more difficult for dissident shareholders to elect representatives as directors and take other similar corporate actions.\nFuture expansion may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may acquire other financial institutions or parts of institutions in the future and may open new branches. We also may consider and enter into new lines of business or offer new products or services. Expansions of our business involve a number of expenses and risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe time and costs associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions or new products or services;\n\u2022\nthe potential inaccuracy of estimates and judgments used to evaluate credit, operations, management and market risk with respect to the target institutions;\n\u2022\nthe time and costs of evaluating new markets, hiring local management and opening new offices, and the delay between commencing these activities and the generation of profits from the expansion;\n\u2022\nour ability to finance an acquisition or other expansion and the possible dilution to our existing shareholders;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention to the negotiation of a transaction and the integration of the operations and personnel of the combining businesses;\n\u2022\nentry into unfamiliar markets;\n\u2022\nthe possible failure of the introduction of new products and services into our existing business;\n\u2022\nthe incurrence and possible impairment of goodwill associated with an acquisition and possible adverse short-term effects on our results of operations; and\n\u2022\nthe risk of loss of key employees and customers.\nWe may incur substantial costs to expand, and we can give no assurance that such expansion will prove to be profitable. Further, we cannot be sure that integration efforts for any future acquisitions will be successful. We may issue equity securities in connection with acquisitions, which could dilute the economic and voting interests of our existing shareholders. We may also lose customers as we close one or more branches as part of a plan to expand into other areas or become more productive from other branches.\nWe may be compelled to seek additional capital in the future but may not be able to access capital when needed.\nWe are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. Federal banking agencies have adopted extensive changes to their capital requirements, including raising required amounts and eliminating the inclusion of certain instruments from the calculation of capital. In addition, we may need to raise additional capital should we experience significant loan losses. We may elect to raise additional capital to support our business, to finance acquisitions, if any, or for other purposes. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on our financial performance, conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, many of which are outside of our control. There can be no assurance, therefore, that we will be able to raise additional capital at all or that the terms of available capital will be acceptable to us. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed or desired, it may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nA default by another larger financial institution could adversely affect financial markets generally.\nMany financial institutions and their related operations are closely intertwined, and the soundness of such financial institutions may, to some degree, be interdependent. As a result, concerns about, or a default or threatened default by, one institution could lead to significant market-wide liquidity and credit problems, losses or defaults by other institutions. This \u201csystemic risk\u201d may adversely affect our business.\nLegal, Regulatory and Accounting Change Risks\nThe enactment of new legislation or regulations may significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to regulations and supervision of the Federal Reserve, and the Bank is subject to regulation and supervision of the ODFI, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the CFPB. Such regulations are designed to protect customers and the DIF, not shareholders. Regulations governing financial institutions are constantly undergoing change. New regulations or amendments could adversely affect the Company's business. Regulatory agencies have great discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on the operation of an institution, the classification of assets held by an institution and the appropriateness of an institution's allowance for loan losses. In addition, actions by regulatory agencies could cause us to devote significant time and resources to compliance and defense of the Company's business and may lead to penalties that materially affect the Company.\nIn recent years, Congress and the banking regulators have increased their focus on the financial services industry. The laws and regulations adopted have subjected the Company and the Bank to additional restrictions, oversight and costs that may have an impact on the financial condition and results of operations of the Company. In 2013, the Company's and the Bank's primary federal regulator established a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations. The new capital rules became effective for the Bank on January 1, 2015, subject to a phase-in period. Any future changes to capital requirements may have an adverse effect on our capital ratios.\nThe current President of the United States and Congress have taken steps to change laws and regulations applicable to financial institutions, including the Company and the Bank. While those steps are generally intended to lessen regulatory burden on financial institutions, the results of such efforts are not yet known, and even the reduction of regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Company, the Bank, or the Company's shareholders if such lessening of restrictions increases competition within the financial services industry or the Company's market area.\nFurther information about government regulation of the Company and the Bank may be found under the heading, \"SUPERVISION AND REGULATION\" in \"ITEM 1. BUSINESS\" of this Form 10-K.\nNoncompliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations could cause us to experience a material financial loss.\nThe Bank Secrecy Act and the Patriot Act contain anti-money laundering and financial transparency provisions intended to detect and prevent the use of the U.S. financial system for money laundering\nand terrorist financing activities. The Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the Patriot Act, requires depository institutions and their holding companies to undertake activities including maintaining an anti-money laundering program, verifying the identity of clients, monitoring for and reporting suspicious transactions, reporting on cash transactions exceeding specified thresholds, and responding to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (also known as FinCEN), a unit of the Treasury Department that administers the Bank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the federal bank regulatory agencies, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration, and Internal Revenue Service.\nThere is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by OFAC. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, or if the policies, procedures and systems of the financial institutions that we have already acquired or may acquire in the future are deficient, we may be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain planned business activities, including acquisition plans, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us.\nChanges in accounting standards could materially impact the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company\u2019s accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how our financial condition and results of operations are recorded and reported. The accounting standard setters, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC, and other regulatory bodies, from time to time may change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how the Company records and reports financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, the Company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in changes to previously reported financial results, or a cumulative charge to retained earnings. Management may be required to make difficult, subjective, or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain. Materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions.\nIn June 2016, FASB issued a new accounting standard for recognizing current expected credit losses, commonly referred to as CECL. CECL will result in earlier recognition of credit losses and requires consideration of not only past and current events but also reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect collectability. The Company will be subject to the new standard in the first quarter of 2023. Upon adoption of CECL, credit loss allowances may increase, which will decrease retained earnings and regulatory capital. The federal banking regulators have adopted a regulation that will allow banks to phase in the day-one impact of CECL on regulatory capital over three years. CECL implementation poses operational risk, including the failure to properly transition internal processes or systems, which could lead to call report errors, financial misstatements, or operational losses.\nChanges in tax laws could adversely affect our performance.\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state and local taxes, including income, excise, sales/use, payroll, franchise, withholding and ad valorem taxes.
