{"cik": "1561921", "company": "TELA Bio, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-23", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following risks described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. While we believe that the risks and uncertainties described below are the material risks facing our business, additional risks that we do not know of or that we currently think are immaterial may also arise and materially affect our business. The realization of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and our ability to accomplish our strategic objectives.\nRisks Related to COVID-19\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is negatively impacting certain aspects of our business and, depending on the severity and duration of the pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted our business, results of operations and financial condition, and we expect the pandemic to continue to negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Extraordinary actions have been taken by federal, state and local governmental authorities to combat the spread of COVID-19, including issuance of \u201cstay-at-home\u201d directives and similar mandates for many individuals to substantially restrict daily activities and for many businesses to curtail or cease normal operations. However, while many restrictions have since eased with COVID-19 vaccines now widely available, the elective surgery market faced additional pandemic-related challenges in 2021 due to regional surges in COVID-19 Delta variant cases, staffing shortages and fatigue from care teams addressing significant procedure backlogs. In December 2021, the COVID-19 Omicron variant prompted some government restrictions on elective procedures and surgical staffing challenges which began to ease in January 2022. While these challenges have recently begun to subside, it is unknown how long it will take the elective surgery market to normalize, or if restrictions on elective procedures will recur due to COVID-19 variant strains or otherwise. We do not know if, and how, future restrictions may affect the surgical communities\u2019 return to, or redefining of, normal operations, whether due to governmental restrictions, institutional, patient or clinical decisions or general economic conditions. New or prolonged suspensions of elective surgeries by governmental restrictions or action would cause net sales of our products to decrease.\nThe health of our workforce is our top concern and we have implemented safety protocols in an effort to maintain the health and safety of our employees. Similar to many other employers in the U.S., we have and may continue to require employees to work remotely. Remote work arrangements could increase operational risk, including, but not limited to, cybersecurity risks. Increased levels of remote access may create additional opportunities for cybercriminals to attempt to exploit vulnerabilities, and our employees may be more susceptible to phishing and social engineering attempts.\nHospitals have reduced and diverted staffing and diverted resources to patients suffering from COVID-19 and have limited hospital access for non-patients, including our sales professionals. In addition, travel restrictions due to COVID-19 have impacted our sales professionals\u2019 ability to travel to customers. These circumstances have negatively impacted our sales professionals\u2019 efforts to market to physicians in person and caused us to develop virtual marketing and sales solutions. If our sales professionals\u2019 efforts to market to physicians in person continue to be negatively impacted, or our virtual marketing and sales solutions prove to be of limited utility or unsuccessful, the sales and market penetration of our OviTex and OviTex PRS products could be negatively impacted.\nIn addition, the spread of COVID-19 has had, and may continue to have, an impact on the number of patients seeking and receiving hernia repair, abdominal wall reconstruction or plastic and reconstructive surgeries, as hospitals cancel elective surgeries and patients postpone these procedures due to COVID-19 concerns, which may reduce demand for our OviTex and OviTex PRS products and negatively impact our sales and results of operations. Even after the pandemic has subsided and/or governmental orders no longer prohibit or recommend against performing such procedures, patients may continue to defer such procedures out of concern of being exposed to COVID-19 or for other reasons.\nCOVID-19 has and may continue to have an impact on ports and trade globally. We currently rely on Aroa, which is headquartered in New Zealand, for supply of our products. While there have been minimal disruptions to our supply chain,\nthere is a risk that in the future supplies of our products may be significantly delayed or may become unavailable as a result of COVID-19 and the resulting impact on Aroa\u2019s labor force and operations, including as a result of governmental restrictions on business operations and the movement of people and goods in an effort to curtail the spread of the virus. There can be no assurance that we would be able to timely implement any mitigation plans relating to our supply chain. Disruptions in our supply chain, whether as a result of restricted travel, quarantine requirements or otherwise, could negatively impact our ability to supply and sell our products.\nThe continued spread of COVID-19 has led to periods of severe disruption and volatility in the global credit or financial markets, and may cause such periods of disruption and volatility in the future, which could result in a decline in our stock price, high inflation, increase our cost of capital and adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets in the future even after local conditions improve. In addition, trading prices on the public stock market have experienced periods of high volatility as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe full extent to which the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic will further, directly or indirectly, impact our business, results of operations and financial condition, including our sales, expenses, manufacturing capability, supply chain integrity, research and development activities, and employee-related matters, including compensation, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain, including, variant strains of the virus and the degree of their vaccine resistance and as a result of new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19, the actions taken to contain or treat it, and the duration and intensity of the related effects.\nInformation pertaining to the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and associated economic disruptions on our operations to date can be found in \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Position and Results of Operations\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Achieving or Sustaining Profitability, Financial Position and Capital Requirements\nWe have incurred significant operating losses since inception, we expect to incur operating losses in the future and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe have incurred net losses since our incorporation on April 17, 2012. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we had net losses of $33.3 million, $28.8 million and $22.4 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $229.9 million.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant sales and marketing, research and clinical development, regulatory and other expenses as we expand our sales and marketing efforts to increase adoption of our products, expand existing relationships with our customers, obtain regulatory clearances or approvals for our planned or future products, conduct clinical trials on our existing and planned or future products and develop new products or add new features to our existing products. As a result, we expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve profitability. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on an ongoing basis. If we do not achieve or sustain profitability, it will be more difficult for us to finance our business and accomplish our strategic objectives, either of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nOur indebtedness may limit our flexibility in operating our business and adversely affect our financial health and competitive position.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $30.0 million of indebtedness outstanding under our credit facility with OrbiMed Royalty Opportunities II, LP (\u201cOrbiMed\u201d) that matures in November 2023.\nTo service this indebtedness and any additional indebtedness we may incur in the future, we need to generate cash from our operating activities. Our ability to generate cash is subject, in part, to our ability to successfully execute our business strategy, as well as general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory, and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future\nborrowings or other financings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness and fund our other liquidity needs. To the extent we are required to use cash from operations or the proceeds of any future financing to service our indebtedness, our ability to plan for, or react to, changes in our business, industry and the economy generally will be limited.\nIn addition, the OrbiMed credit facility contains certain covenants that limit our ability to engage in certain transactions that may be in our long-term best interests. Subject to certain limited exceptions, these covenants limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u25cf create, incur, assume or permit to exist any additional indebtedness, or create, incur, allow or permit to exist any additional liens;\n\u25cf enter into any amendment, supplement, waiver or other modification of, or enter into any forbearance from exercising any rights with respect to, the terms or provisions contained in certain agreements without consent;\n\u25cf effect certain changes in our business, fiscal year, management, entity name, business locations;\n\u25cf liquidate or dissolve, merge with or into, consolidate with, or acquire all or substantially all of the capital stock or assets of, any other company;\n\u25cf pay cash dividends on, make any other distributions in respect of, or redeem, retire or repurchase, any shares of our capital stock;\n\u25cf make certain investments; and\n\u25cf enter into transactions with our affiliates.\nWe have not previously breached and are not currently in breach of these or any of the other covenants; however, there can be no guarantee that we will not breach these covenants in the future. In the event that we breach one or more covenants, our lender may choose to declare an event of default and require that we immediately repay all amounts outstanding, terminate any commitment to extend further credit and foreclose on the collateral granted to it to collateralize such indebtedness. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may require substantial additional capital to finance our planned operations, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.\nIf needed, any future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u25cf surgeon and market acceptance of our products;\n\u25cf the cost of our research and development activities;\n\u25cf the cost and timing of obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals;\n\u25cf the cost and timing of establishing additional sales and marketing capabilities;\n\u25cf the cost and timing of clinical trials that we are currently conducting or may conduct in the future;\n\u25cf costs associated with any product recall that may occur;\n\u25cf the effect of competing products in our markets or competing technologies;\n\u25cf the extent to which we acquire or invest in products, technologies and businesses, although we currently have no commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions;\n\u25cf the cost of filing and prosecuting patent applications and defending and enforcing our patent or other intellectual property rights; and\n\u25cf the cost of defending, in litigation or otherwise, any claims that we infringe third-party patents or other intellectual property rights.\nAny additional equity or debt financing that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders. In addition, any future debt financing into which we enter may impose upon us additional covenants that restrict our operations, including limitations on our ability to incur liens or additional debt, pay dividends, repurchase our common stock, make certain investments or engage in certain merger, consolidation or asset sale transactions. If we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third-parties, it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our technologies or our products, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nFurthermore, we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. If we do not have, or are not able to obtain, sufficient funds, we may have to delay development or commercialization of our products or license to third-parties the rights to commercialize products or technologies that we would otherwise seek to commercialize. We also may have to reduce marketing, customer support or other resources devoted to our products or cease operations. Any of these factors could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to expand, manage and maintain our direct sales and marketing organizations, we may not be able to generate anticipated revenue.\nBuilding the requisite sales, marketing and distribution capabilities to successfully market and sell our products continues to be expensive and time-consuming and requires significant attention from our leadership team to manage. Any failure or delay in the expansion of our sales, marketing or distribution capabilities would adversely impact the commercialization of our products. Additionally, we may choose to collaborate, either globally or on a territory-by-territory basis, with third parties on the commercialization of our products. If we are unable to enter into such arrangements on acceptable terms or at all, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our products.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our commercial organization consisted of 84 employees in the U.S. and 7 employees in Europe. To generate future revenue growth, we plan to expand the size and geographic scope of our direct sales organization. This growth may require us to split or adjust existing sales territories, which may adversely affect our ability to retain customers in those territories. Additionally, our future success will depend largely on our ability to continue to hire, train, retain and motivate skilled sales and marketing personnel with significant industry experience and technical knowledge of medical devices and related products. The competition for talented individuals experienced in selling and marketing medical device products is intense, and we cannot assure you that we can assemble or maintain an effective team. We cannot assure you that we will be able to hire and retain additional personnel on favorable or commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Our operating results are directly dependent upon the sales and marketing efforts of our employees. Failure to hire or retain qualified sales and marketing personnel would prevent us from expanding our business and generating revenue. If we are unable to expand our sales and marketing capabilities, we may not be able to effectively commercialize our products, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Commercialization of our Products\nTo date, the vast majority of our revenue has been generated from sales of our OviTex products, and we therefore are highly dependent on the commercial success of OviTex product line.\nSales of our OviTex products accounted for 78%, 83% and 91% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We first commercialized OviTex products in the U.S. in 2016 and have introduced our larger sized OviTex products, our OviTex LPR product for use in laparoscopic and robotic-assisted hernia surgical\nrepairs and OviTex PRS products for use in surgery for soft-tissue repair or reinforcement in plastic and reconstructive procedures. We expect that sales of our OviTex products and our OviTex PRS products, will account for all of our revenue for the foreseeable future. Our failure to successfully increase sales of these products or any other event impeding our ability to sell these products would result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe commercial success of our products will largely depend upon attaining significant market acceptance.\nOur ability to execute our growth strategy, achieve commercial success and become profitable will depend upon the adoption by inpatient and outpatient hospitals, surgeons, and medical device supply chain participants of our reinforced tissue matrix products. We cannot predict how quickly, if at all, surgeons will accept our products or, if accepted, how frequently they will be used. Our products and planned or future products we may develop or market may never gain broad market acceptance among surgeons and the medical community for some or all of our indications. Some surgeons may have prior history with or a preference for other soft-tissue reinforcement products, such as permanent synthetic mesh, resorbable synthetic mesh, or other biologic matrices, or may be reluctant to alter their practice patterns to treat patients with our reinforced tissue matrix products. The degree of market acceptance of any of our products will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf whether surgeons and others in the medical community consider our products to be safe, effective and cost effective;\n\u25cf the potential and perceived advantages of our products over alternative products;\n\u25cf the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts for our products;\n\u25cf the prevalence and severity of any complications associated with using our products;\n\u25cf the convenience and ease of use of our products relative to competing products;\n\u25cf product labeling or product insert requirements by regulatory authorities;\n\u25cf the competitive pricing of our products;\n\u25cf the quality of our products meeting patient and surgeon expectations;\n\u25cf the results of clinical trials and post-market clinical studies relating to the use of our products;\n\u25cf pricing pressure, including from GPOs and government payors;\n\u25cf the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement for procedures using our products from third-party payors, including government authorities;\n\u25cf the willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket for our products in the absence of coverage and adequate reimbursement by third-party payors, including government authorities; and\n\u25cf our ability to provide incremental clinical and economic data that show the safety, clinical efficacy and cost effectiveness, and patient benefits from, our products.\nAdditionally, even if our products achieve market acceptance, they may not maintain that market acceptance over time if competing products or technologies, which are more cost effective or received more favorably, are introduced. Failure to achieve or maintain market acceptance and/or market share would limit our ability to generate revenue and would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEven if we are able to attain significant market acceptance of our products, the commercial success of our products is not guaranteed.\nOur future financial success will depend substantially on our ability to effectively and profitably market and sell our products. Even if we are able to attain significant market acceptance of our products, the commercial success of our products and any of our planned or future products is dependent on a number of additional factors, including the results of clinical trials relating to the use of our products and our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval or clearance to market our products and maintain compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. Successful growth of our sales and marketing efforts will depend on the strength of our marketing and distribution infrastructure and the effectiveness of our marketing and sales efforts, including our efforts to expand our direct sales force, while our ability to satisfy demand for our products driven by our sales and marketing efforts will be largely dependent on the ability of Aroa to maintain a commercially viable manufacturing process that is compliant with regulatory standards. If we fail to successfully market and sell our products, we will not be able to achieve profitability, which will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to grow our revenue in future periods will depend on our ability to increase sales of our OviTex and OviTex PRS products and any new product or product indications that we introduce, which will, in turn, depend in part on our success in expanding our customer base and driving increased use of our products. New products or product indications may also need to be approved or cleared by the FDA and comparable non-U.S. regulatory agencies to drive revenue growth. If we cannot achieve revenue growth, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe misuse or off-label use of our products may harm our reputation in the marketplace, result in injuries that lead to product liability suits or result in costly investigations, fines or sanctions by regulatory bodies if we are deemed to have engaged in the promotion of our products for these uses.\nSurgeons and other medical professionals may misuse our reinforced tissue matrix products or use improper techniques if they are not adequately trained, potentially leading to injury and an increased risk of product liability. If our products are misused or used with improper technique, we may become subject to costly litigation by our customers or their patients. Product liability claims could divert management\u2019s attention from our core business, be expensive to defend and result in sizeable damage awards against us that may not be covered by insurance. In addition, any of the events described above could harm our business.\nThe products we commercialize have been cleared by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for specific indications. Our OviTex products are reinforced tissue matrices designed for use as a surgical mesh to reinforce and/or repair soft-tissue where weakness exists and indications for use of our OviTex products include the repair of hernia and/or abdominal wall defects which require the use of reinforcing or bridging material to obtain the desired surgical outcome. Our OviTex PRS products are reconstructive reinforced tissue matrices designed for implantation to reinforce soft-tissue where weakness exists in patients requiring soft tissue repair or reinforcement in plastic and reconstructive surgery. In connection with the March 2019 meeting of the General and Plastic Surgery Devices Panel of the Medical Devices Advisory Committee, the FDA stated that no surgical mesh device, including OviTex PRS, has been cleared or approved for use in breast surgery, and that to obtain such indication, the product sponsor must obtain an approved PMA. Our OviTex PRS products are not cleared or approved for breast reconstruction surgery and thus we are prohibited from marketing them for that use. OviTex PRS or any other product we may develop for use in breast reconstruction surgery will need to be approved specifically for that indication and there can be no guarantee that it will be approved. We have engaged in discussions with the FDA regarding an IDE protocol to study the safety and effectiveness of our OviTex PRS product for an indication in breast reconstruction surgery. There can be no assurance that we will be able to secure an IDE in a timely manner, or at all. Any marketing for OviTex PRS or any other product for a use in breast reconstruction surgery would be deemed off-label promotion of that product if it has been cleared for a general indication of use to reinforce or repair soft-tissue and has not received an approval specifically for use in breast surgery. We train our marketing personnel and direct sales force to not promote our OviTex or OviTex PRS products for uses outside of the FDA-cleared indications for use, known as \u201coff-label uses.\u201d We cannot, however, prevent a surgeon or medical professional from using our OviTex or OviTex PRS products or other products we may commercialize in the future for off-label uses.\nAlthough we train our direct sales force not to promote our products for off-label uses, and our instructions for use in all markets specify that our products are not intended for use outside of those indications cleared or approved for use, the FDA or another regulatory authority could conclude that we have engaged in off-label promotion. If the FDA determines that our promotional or training materials constitute promotion of an off-label use, or make claims that are not supported by the available clinical data, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions. It is also possible that other federal, state or non-U.S. enforcement authorities might take action under other regulatory authority if they consider our business activities to constitute promotion of an off-label use, or are otherwise objectionable, which could result in significant penalties, including, but not limited to, criminal, civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and the curtailment of our operations.\nEven if surgeons or medical professionals use our OviTex products only for their approved indications, a failure by such surgeons and medical professionals to use our products in accordance with the processes and procedures established to properly utilize our OviTex products could result in product liability lawsuits, costly investigations and potentially affect our ability to achieve sufficient market penetration for our OviTex products. In those possible events, our reputation could be damaged and adoption of the products would be impaired. We may also be required to reassess the training, written instructions and product warnings or other labeling information we provide our customers. This process could require us to expend significant time and capital and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to grow our business.\nIf we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate levels of coverage or reimbursement for our OviTex, OviTex PRS or other products we may commercialize in the future, our commercial success may be hindered.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize and achieve market acceptance of our products depends, in significant part, on the availability of adequate financial coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, including governmental payors (such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs in the U.S.), managed care organizations and private health insurers. The primary customers for our products are hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers who will then seek reimbursement from third-party payors for the procedures performed using our products. While some third-party payors currently cover and provide reimbursement for procedures using our currently cleared or approved products, we can give no assurance that these third-party payors will continue to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for the procedures using our products, to permit hospitals and surgeons to offer procedures using our products to patients requiring treatment, or that current reimbursement levels for procedures using our products will continue. Additionally, no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement exists in the U.S. and coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. If third-party payors reverse or limit their coverage for the procedures using our currently cleared or approved products in the future, this could have a material adverse effect on our business. If we are forced to lower the price we charge for our products, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to grow our business.\nHealthcare costs have risen significantly over the past decade, which has resulted in or led to numerous cost reform initiatives. Third-party payors, whether U.S. or non-U.S., or governmental or commercial, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs, including examining the cost effectiveness of procedures, in addition to their safety and efficacy, when making coverage and payment decisions. Payors continually review new and existing technologies for possible coverage and can, without notice, deny or reverse coverage or alter pre-authorization requirements for new or existing procedures. We cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in any efforts we may potentially undertake to reverse such non-coverage decisions. If we are not successful in reversing non-coverage policies, or if third-party payors that currently cover or reimburse certain procedures reverse or limit their coverage of such procedures in the future, or if other third-party payors issue similar policies, our business could be adversely impacted.\nOur long-term growth depends on our ability to enhance our product offerings.\nIt is important to our business that we continue to enhance our OviTex and OviTex PRS products and develop and introduce new reinforced tissue matrix products. Developing products is expensive and time-consuming and could divert management\u2019s attention away from other aspects of our business. The success of any new reinforced tissue matrix\nproduct offering or product enhancements to our OviTex and OviTex PRS products will depend on several factors, including our ability to:\n\u25cf properly identify and anticipate surgeon and patient needs;\n\u25cf develop and introduce new products and product enhancements in a timely manner;\n\u25cf avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of third parties;\n\u25cf ensure the quality, manufacture and supply of new products by Aroa;\n\u25cf demonstrate, if required, the safety and efficacy of new products with data from preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u25cf obtain the necessary regulatory clearances or approvals for expanded indications, new products or product modifications;\n\u25cf be fully FDA-compliant with marketing of new devices or products;\n\u25cf provide adequate training to potential users of our new products;\n\u25cf receive adequate coverage and reimbursement for procedures performed with our new products; and\n\u25cf develop an effective and dedicated sales and marketing team.\nIf we are not successful in introducing new product indications and developing and commercializing new products and product enhancements, our ability to increase our revenue may be impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the future our products may become obsolete, which would negatively affect operations and financial condition.\nThe medical device industry is characterized by rapid and significant change. There can be no assurance that other companies will not succeed in developing or marketing devices and products that are more effective than our reinforced tissue matrix products or that would render our reinforced tissue matrix products obsolete or noncompetitive. Additionally, new surgical procedures, medications and other therapies could be developed that replace or reduce the importance of our products. Accordingly, our success will depend in part on our ability to respond quickly to medical and other changes through the development and introduction of new products. Our reinforced tissue matrix products have a limited shelf life and will expire if not timely used. Product development involves a high degree of risk, and there can be no assurance that our new product development efforts will result in any commercially successful products.\nTo successfully market and sell our products in markets outside of the U.S., we must address many international business risks with which we have limited experience.\nApproximately 5%, 4% and 2% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, came from sales in markets outside of the U.S. Part of our sales strategy is to maintain our European presence. European sales are subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u25cf difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;\n\u25cf increased competition as a result of more products and procedures receiving regulatory approval in international markets;\n\u25cf longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u25cf fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u25cf non-U.S. certification and regulatory clearance or approval requirements;\n\u25cf difficulties in developing effective marketing campaigns in unfamiliar non-U.S. countries;\n\u25cf the impact of the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union;\n\u25cf customs clearance and shipping delays;\n\u25cf complexities associated with managing multiple payor reimbursement regimes, government payors or patient self-pay systems;\n\u25cf political, social, and economic instability abroad, terrorist attacks, and security concerns in general;\n\u25cf the global impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u25cf natural disasters and global pandemics like COVID-19, which result in lock-downs, travel restrictions and other restrictions on our ability to operate internationally;\n\u25cf preference for locally produced products;\n\u25cf potentially adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of non-U.S. value-added tax systems, tax inefficiencies related to our corporate structure, and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings;\n\u25cf the burdens of complying with a wide variety of non-U.S. laws and different legal standards; and\n\u25cf increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities.\nIf one or more of these risks are realized, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties\nWe are highly dependent upon Aroa, as the exclusive manufacturer and supplier of our products.\nIn August 2012, we entered into our Aroa License which was amended and restated in July 2015. The Aroa License grants us an exclusive license in North America, the EU, United Kingdom, Norway, Switzerland, Russia and former Soviet satellite countries to certain intellectual property rights, including patents relating to the use of bovine and ovine rumen as a source of extracellular matrix. Under the Aroa License, Aroa is our exclusive manufacturer and supplier of our products.\nWe are reliant upon the intellectual property we license from Aroa for the development and commercialization of our products. Under the Aroa License, we hold an exclusive license to certain intellectual and technology rights to develop, commercialize and sell certain endoform regenerative template products derived from cows and sheep. The Aroa License also provides for cooperative development of our products utilizing the licensed intellectual property and all of our products rely on intellectual property owned by Aroa and licensed to us under the Aroa License. The Aroa License imposes various developmental and regulatory requirements upon us along with requiring us to make milestone payments upon the achievement of certain commercial and regulatory milestones. If we fail to comply with our obligations under the Aroa License, Aroa will have the right to terminate the Aroa License, in which event we would not be able to develop and market our products. We are obligated to pay Aroa up to an aggregate of $4.0 million in revenue-based milestone payments upon our achievement of certain net sales thresholds for sales of our products within the specified licensed territory, of which we have already paid $3.0 million.\nAroa is required under the Aroa License to manufacture all of our products at its manufacturing and warehousing facility in Auckland, New Zealand. The production of all of our products in a single location exposes us to the risk of Aroa\u2019s facility being harmed or rendered inoperable by natural or man-made disasters or pandemics, which may render it difficult or impossible for Aroa to perform its manufacturing and assembly activities for some time. Although we and Aroa intend to establish redundant production facilities to lessen the risk of production disruptions, we will need to ensure that any manufacturing facility complies with our quality expectations and applicable regulatory requirements. If we are unable to establish redundant manufacturing facilities in a timely manner, any disruption in the manufacture of our products at Aroa\u2019s manufacturing and warehouse facility, the continued commercialization of our products, the supply of our products to customers and the development of any new reinforced tissue matrix products will be delayed, limited or prevented, which could have material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnder the Aroa License, Aroa provides all of the raw materials and components used in the manufacture and assembly of our products. If Aroa is unable to supply the raw materials and components or to manufacture and assemble our products reliably and at the levels we anticipate or that are required by the market, we may be unable to acquire a substitute supply of raw materials and components on a timely basis, if at all. Under the Aroa License Aroa also holds the FDA clearances under which we commercialize our products, and maintains ultimate responsibility for all regulatory interactions with FDA relating to our products and decisions made with respect to changing or updating those clearances. If Aroa fails to comply with all applicable regulatory requirements and maintain the FDA clearances related to our products, we may be unable to commercialize our products on a timely basis, or at all. Our ability to supply our products commercially and to develop any future products depends, in part, on our ability to obtain these materials, components and products in accordance with regulatory requirements and in sufficient quantities for commercialization and clinical testing. While Aroa has historically met our demand for its products and services on a timely basis in the past, we cannot guarantee that it will always be able to meet our demand for its products. If Aroa fails to meet demand or notifies us that it believes it will fail to meet demand for our products, we are required under the Aroa License to work with Aroa to cure its supply failure and may, only in certain circumstances and on a temporary basis, engage a replacement contract manufacturer to mitigate a failure by Aroa to meet demand for our products. As such, we are highly dependent upon Aroa\u2019s continued ability to supply our products at the levels we require and any production shortfall that impairs the supply of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and adversely affect our ability to satisfy demand for our products, which could adversely affect our product sales and operating results materially.\nWe, or our partners, may experience development or manufacturing problems, capacity constraints, or delays in the production of our products that could limit the potential growth of our revenue or increase our losses.\nWe may encounter unforeseen situations in Aroa\u2019s manufacturing and assembly of our products that would result in delays or shortfalls in its production. For example, Aroa was unable to supply us with our products from September 2017 to December 2017 due to a quality testing process failure identified by Aroa. Personnel shortages and reduced manufacturing capacity due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may also result in a disruption in production.\nBased upon our current planned market adoption we believe we will reach our capacity limitations in the Aroa facility. Aroa is in the process of expanding manufacturing capacity, with approximately 15,000 square feet of additional manufacturing space being constructed in a neighboring facility, available in 2022. However, there can be no assurance that the new manufacturing facility will be completed on time or at all. If we are unable to successfully expand capacity, we may not be able to meet the demand for our products. In addition, Aroa\u2019s production processes and assembly methods may have to change in order to accommodate any significant future expansion of its manufacturing capacity, which may increase our manufacturing costs, delay production of our products and adversely impact our business. Conversely, if demand for our products shifts such that Aroa\u2019s manufacturing facility is operated below its capacity for an extended period, it may adjust its manufacturing operations to reduce fixed costs, which could lead to uncertainty and delays in manufacturing times and quality during any transition period.\nIf Aroa\u2019s manufacturing activities are adversely impacted or if it is otherwise unable to keep up with demand for our products by successfully manufacturing, assembling, testing and shipping our products in a timely manner, our revenue could be impaired, market acceptance for our products could be adversely affected and our customers might instead\npurchase our competitors\u2019 products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur products contain materials derived from animal sources and may become subject to additional regulation.\nOur products are manufactured using ovine rumen. Products that contain materials derived from animal sources are increasingly subject to scrutiny in the media and by regulatory authorities. Regulatory authorities are concerned about the potential for the transmission of disease, particularly progressive neurodegenerative disorders, from animals to humans via those materials. In addition, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has heightened public awareness of animals and animal products as a disease vector. Products that contain materials derived from animals, including our products, may become subject to additional regulation, or even be banned in certain countries, because of concern over the potential for the transmission of infectious agents. Significant new regulation, or a ban of our products, could impair our current business or our ability to expand our business, and in the case of a ban or suspension, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur supply of ovine rumen for use in manufacturing our products may be vulnerable to disruption due to natural disaster, disease or other events.\nThe ovine rumen used in the manufacturing of our products is sourced through Aroa in New Zealand. Although Aroa obtains its supply of ovine rumen from jurisdictions with sheep that are not currently known to carry any prion disease (progressive neurodegenerative disorders, including scrapie disease), there can be no assurance that these flocks will remain prion disease-free or that a future outbreak or presence of other unintended and potentially hazardous agents would not adversely affect our products or patients that may receive them. The geographic concentration of our supply chain increases our vulnerability to disruption due to natural disasters, disease or other events. If there is a disruption in the supply of ovine rumen to our manufacturer and supplier, we may be unable to fulfill customer orders or delay the commercialization of new products.\nWe may also be prohibited from importing our products into the U.S. in the event of disease outbreak or other event impacting the sheep population in New Zealand. Any disruption in our supply lines could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPerformance issues, service interruptions or price increases by our shipping carriers could adversely affect our business and harm our reputation and ability to provide our products on a timely basis.\nExpedited, reliable shipping is essential to our operations. We rely heavily on providers of transport services for reliable and secure point-to-point transport of our OviTex and OviTex PRS products (and would rely heavily on such providers for any other products we may commercialize and ship in the future) to our customers and for tracking of these shipments. Should a carrier encounter delivery performance issues such as loss, damage or destruction of any of our products, it would be costly to replace such products in a timely manner and such occurrences may damage our reputation and lead to decreased demand for our OviTex and OviTex PRS products (or any other products we commercialize in the future) and increased cost and expense to our business. In addition, any significant increase in shipping rates could adversely affect our operating margins and results of operations. Similarly, strikes, severe weather, natural disasters, disease or other service interruptions affecting delivery services we use would adversely affect our ability to deliver our OviTex and OviTex PRS products (or any other products we commercialize in the future) on a timely basis. For example, disruptions to transportation infrastructure as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may impact our ability to provide our products to our customers.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property Matters\nWe may need to license intellectual property from third parties, and such licenses may not be available or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.\nWe may need to obtain licenses from third parties to advance our research or allow commercialization of our products, and we cannot provide any assurances that third-party patents do not exist which might be enforced against our products\nin the absence of such a license. The licensing and acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights is a competitive practice and companies that may be more established, or have greater resources than we do, may also be pursuing strategies to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights that we may consider necessary or attractive in order to commercialize our products. We may fail to obtain any of these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Even if we are able to obtain a license, it may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. In that event, we may be required to expend significant time and resources to develop or license replacement technology. If we are unable to do so, we may be unable to develop or commercialize the affected products, which could materially harm our business and the third parties owning such intellectual property rights could seek either an injunction prohibiting our sales, or, with respect to our sales, an obligation on our part to pay royalties and/or other forms of compensation. Licensing of intellectual property is of critical importance to our business and involves complex legal, business and scientific issues. If disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on acceptable terms, we may not be able to successfully develop and commercialize the affected products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations under any license, collaboration or other agreements, we could lose intellectual property rights that are necessary for developing and protecting our products.\nWe have licensed certain intellectual property rights covering our current products from third parties, including Aroa. We are heavily dependent on our agreements with such third parties for our current products. If, for any reason, one or more of our agreements is terminated or we otherwise lose those rights, it could harm our business. Our license and other agreements impose, and any future collaboration agreements or license agreements we enter into are likely to impose various development, commercialization, funding, milestone, royalty, diligence, sublicensing, insurance, patent prosecution and enforcement or other obligations on us. If we breach any material obligations, or use the intellectual property licensed to us in an unauthorized manner, we may be required to pay damages and the licensor may have the right to terminate the license, which could result in us being unable to develop, manufacture and sell products that are covered by the licensed technology, having to negotiate new or reinstated licenses on less favorable terms, or enabling a competitor to gain access to the licensed technology.\nIf we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, or if we are accused of infringing on the intellectual property rights of others, our competitive position could be harmed or we could be required to incur significant expenses to enforce or defend our rights.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on our success in obtaining and maintaining issued patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights in the U.S. and elsewhere and protecting our proprietary technology. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology, competitors may be able to use our technologies or the goodwill we have acquired in the marketplace and erode or negate any competitive advantage we may have, which could harm our business and ability to achieve profitability.\nWe own twelve issued or allowed U.S. patents and have eight pending U.S. patent applications. As of December 31, 2021, we had rights, whether through ownership or licensing, to fourteen issued or allowed U.S. patents, eight pending U.S. patent applications, five issued non-U.S. patents and four pending non-U.S. patent applications. Our issued U.S. patents will expire between 2035 and 2038. The licensed patents will expire between 2029 and 2031.\nOur ability to enforce our patent rights depends on our ability to detect infringement. It may be difficult to detect infringers who do not advertise the components that are used in their products. Moreover, it may be difficult or impossible to obtain evidence of infringement in a competitor\u2019s or potential competitor\u2019s product. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded if we were to prevail may not be commercially meaningful.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. We cannot provide any assurances that any of our patents, or patents to which we have ownership rights through licensing\nagreements, have, or that any of our pending patent applications that mature into issued patents will include, claims with a scope sufficient to protect our OviTex and OviTex PRS products, any additional features we develop for our OviTex and OviTex PRS products or any new products we seek to develop in the future. Other parties may have developed technologies that may be related or competitive to our OviTex or OviTex PRS products, may have filed or may file patent applications and may have received or may receive patents that overlap or conflict with our patent applications, either by claiming the same methods or devices or by claiming subject matter that could dominate our patent position. The patent positions of medical device companies, including our patent position, may involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions, and, therefore, the issuance, scope, validity and enforceability of any patent claims that we may obtain cannot be predicted with certainty. Patents, if issued, may be challenged, deemed unenforceable, invalidated or circumvented. Proceedings challenging our patents could result in either loss of the patent or denial of the patent application or loss or reduction in the scope of one or more of the claims of the patent or patent application. In addition, such proceedings may be costly. Thus, any patents that we may own, or to which we have ownership rights through licensing agreements, may not provide any protection against competitors. Furthermore, an adverse decision in a judicial or administrative proceeding can result in a third party receiving the patent right sought by us, which in turn could affect our ability to commercialize our products.\nPatents covering our products could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court or before administrative bodies in the U.S. or abroad.\nAlthough an issued patent is presumed valid and enforceable, its issuance is not conclusive as to its validity or its enforceability and it may not provide us with adequate proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar products. Competitors could purchase our OviTex or OviTex PRS products and attempt to replicate the competitive advantages we derive from our development efforts, willfully infringe our intellectual property rights, design around the relevant patents, or develop and obtain patent protection for more effective technologies, designs or methods. We may be unable to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or trade secrets by consultants, suppliers, vendors, former employees and current employees. The laws of some non-U.S. countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S., and we may encounter significant problems in protecting our proprietary rights in these countries.\nIn addition, proceedings to enforce or defend our patents, or patents to which we have ownership rights through licensing agreements, could put those patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable or interpreted narrowly. Such proceedings could also provoke third parties to assert claims against us, including that some or all of the claims in one or more of those patents are invalid or otherwise unenforceable. If any of the patents covering our OviTex or OviTex PRS products are invalidated or found unenforceable, or if a court found that valid, enforceable patents held by third parties covered one or more of our products, our competitive position could be harmed or we could be required to incur significant expenses to enforce or defend our rights.\nThird parties may assert ownership or commercial rights to inventions we develop.\nThird parties may in the future make claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our intellectual property. In addition, we may face claims by third parties that our agreements with employees, contractors or consultants obligating them to assign intellectual property to us are ineffective or in conflict with prior or competing contractual obligations of assignment, which could result in ownership disputes regarding intellectual property we have developed or will develop and interfere with our ability to capture the commercial value of such intellectual property. Litigation may be necessary to resolve an ownership dispute, and if we are not successful, we may be precluded from using certain intellectual property or may lose our exclusive rights in such intellectual property. Either outcome could harm our business and competitive position.\nLitigation or other proceedings or third-party claims of intellectual property infringement could require us to spend significant time and money, enter into license agreements for disputed intellectual property and could prevent us from selling our products.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on not infringing the patents or violating other proprietary rights of others. Significant litigation regarding patent rights occurs in our industry. Our competitors may have applied for or obtained, or\nmay in the future apply for and obtain, patents that will prevent, limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make, use and sell our products. We do not always conduct independent reviews of patents issued to third parties. In addition, patent applications in the U.S. and elsewhere can be pending for many years before issuance, or unintentionally abandoned patents or applications can be revived, so there may be applications of others now pending or recently revived patents of which we are unaware. Patent applications in the U.S., the EU and elsewhere are published approximately 18 months after the earliest filing for which priority is claimed, with such earliest filing date being commonly referred to as the priority date. These applications may later result in issued patents, or the revival of previously abandoned patents, that will prevent, limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to develop and market our products. Third parties may assert claims that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization, including claims from competitors or from nonpracticing entities that have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patent portfolio may have no deterrent effect.\nAs we continue to commercialize our products in their current or updated forms, launch new products and enter new markets, we expect competitors may claim that one or more of our products infringe their intellectual property rights as a strategy to impede our commercialization and entry into new markets. The large number of patents, the rapid rate of new patent applications and issuances, the complexities of the technologies involved, and the uncertainty of litigation may increase the risk of business resources and management\u2019s attention being diverted to patent litigation. We have received, and we may in the future receive, letters or other threats or claims from third parties inviting us to take licenses under, or alleging that we infringe, their patents.\nMoreover, we may become party to adversarial proceedings regarding our or third-party patent portfolios. Such proceedings could include supplemental examination or contested post-grant proceedings such as review, reexamination, inter partes review, interference or derivation proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d) and challenges in U.S. District Courts. Patents may be subjected to opposition, post-grant review or comparable proceedings lodged in various foreign, both national and regional, patent offices. The legal threshold for initiating litigation or contested proceedings may be low, so that even lawsuits or proceedings with a low probability of success might be initiated. Litigation and contested proceedings can also be expensive and time-consuming, and our adversaries in these proceedings may have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to prosecuting these legal actions than we can. We may also occasionally use these proceedings to challenge the patent rights of others. We cannot be certain that any particular challenge will be successful in limiting or eliminating the challenged patent rights of the third party.\nAny lawsuits resulting from such allegations could subject us to significant liability for damages and/ or invalidate our proprietary rights. Any potential intellectual property litigation also could force us to do one or more of the following:\n\u25cf stop making, selling or using products or technologies that allegedly infringe the asserted intellectual property;\n\u25cf lose the opportunity to license our technology to others or to collect royalty payments;\n\u25cf incur significant legal expenses, including, in some cases, the attorney\u2019s fees and costs of litigation to the party whose intellectual property rights we may be found to be infringing;\n\u25cf pay substantial damages (possibly treble damages) or royalties to the party whose intellectual property rights on which we may be found to be infringing;\n\u25cf redesign products that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property; and\n\u25cf attempt to obtain a license to the relevant intellectual property from third parties, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all.\nAny litigation or claim against us, even those without merit, may cause us to incur substantial costs, and could place a significant strain on our financial resources, divert the attention of management from our business and harm our reputation. If we are found to infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, we could be required to pay\nsubstantial damages (which may be increased up to three times of awarded damages) and/or substantial royalties and could be prevented from selling our products unless we obtain a license or are able to redesign our products to avoid infringement. In addition, we may choose to seek, or be required to seek, a license from a third party, which may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Even if a license can be obtained on acceptable terms, the rights may be non-exclusive, which could give any competitors access to the same technology or intellectual property rights license to us. Any such license may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all, and there can be no assurance that we would be able to redesign our products in a technically feasible way that would not infringe the intellectual property rights of others. We could encounter delays in product introductions while we attempt to develop alternative methods or products. If we fail to obtain a required license, the holders of any such patents may be able to block us, our licenses or our collaborators from marketing products based on the disputed technology until such patents expire, which could limit our ability to generate revenue or achieve profitability and possibly prevent us from generating revenue sufficient to sustain our operations.\nEven if we were ultimately to prevail, any of these events could require us to divert substantial financial and management resources that we would otherwise be able to devote to our business. Intellectual property litigation, regardless of its outcome, may cause negative publicity, adversely impact prospective customers, cause product shipment delays, or prohibit us from manufacturing, importing, marketing or otherwise commercializing our products, services and technology. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided the patents and patent applications we own or in-license is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future products. In addition, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments, and if securities analysts or investors view these announcements in a negative light, the price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, we generally indemnify our customers with respect to infringement by our products of the proprietary rights of third parties. Third parties may assert infringement claims against our customers. These claims may require us to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation on behalf of our customers, regardless of the merits of these claims. If any of these claims succeed or settle, we may be forced to pay damages or settlement payments on behalf of our customers or may be required to obtain licenses for the products they use. If we cannot obtain all necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, our customers may be forced to stop using our products.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position could be harmed.\nWe also rely upon copyright and trade secret protection, as well as non-disclosure agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties, to protect our confidential and proprietary information.\nIn addition to contractual measures, we try to protect the confidential nature of our proprietary information using commonly accepted physical and technological security measures. Such measures may not provide adequate protection for our proprietary information. Our security measures may not prevent an employee or consultant from misappropriating our trade secrets and providing them to a competitor, and recourse we take against such misconduct may not provide an adequate remedy to protect our interests fully. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to copy or reverse engineer certain aspects of our products that we consider proprietary. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret can be difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome of any such claim is unpredictable. Trade secret violations are often a matter of state law, and the criteria for protection of trade secrets can vary among different jurisdictions. In addition, trade secrets may be independently developed or reverse engineered by others in a manner that could prevent legal recourse by us. If any of our confidential or proprietary information, such as our trade secrets, were to be disclosed or misappropriated, or if any such information was independently developed by a competitor, our business and competitive position could be harmed.\nIf our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest.\nIf our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in our target markets and our business may be adversely affected. At times, competitors may adopt trade names or trademarks similar to ours, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity, possibly leading to market confusion and potentially requiring us to pursue legal action. In addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other registered trademarks or trademarks that incorporate variations of our unregistered trademarks or trade names. If we are unable to successfully register our trademarks and trade names and establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, then we may not be able to compete effectively and our business may be adversely affected. Our efforts to enforce or protect our proprietary rights related to trademarks, trade secrets, domain names, copyrights or other intellectual property may be ineffective and could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may be unable to enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents covering our products in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. This could make it difficult for us to stop infringement of our foreign patents, if obtained, or the misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights. For example, some foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. In addition, some countries limit the enforceability of patents against third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit. Patent protection must ultimately be sought on a country-by-country basis, which is an expensive and time-consuming process with uncertain outcomes. Accordingly, we may choose not to seek patent protection in certain countries, and we will not have the benefit of patent protection in such countries. Additionally, in the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our products, which could result in loss of brand recognition and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands. Our competitors may infringe our trademarks, and we may not have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks.\nProceedings to enforce our patent or trademark rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. Accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate.\nThird parties may assert that our employees or consultants have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information or misappropriated trade secrets.\nWe employ individuals who previously worked with other companies, including our competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees and consultants do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed intellectual property or personal data, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of a former employer or other third party. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims or settling those claims, in addition to paying monetary damages or a settlement payment, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.\nRecent changes in U.S. patent laws may limit our ability to obtain, defend and/or enforce our patents.\nThe U.S. has recently enacted and implemented wide ranging patent reform legislation. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on actions by the U.S. Congress, the U.S. federal courts, and the USPTO, the\nlaws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that could weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce patents that we have licensed or that we might obtain in the future. Similarly, changes in patent law and regulations in other countries or jurisdictions, changes in the governmental bodies that enforce them or changes in how the relevant governmental authority enforces patent laws or regulations may weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce patents that we have licensed or that we may obtain in the future.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nThe USPTO and other patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. In addition, periodic maintenance and annuity fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the USPTO and other patent agencies over the lifetime of the patent. While an inadvertent failure to make payment of such fees or to comply with such provisions can in many cases be cured by additional payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which non-compliance with such provisions will result in the abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, and the partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents within prescribed time limits. If we or our licensors fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering our product or if we or our licensors otherwise allow our patents or patent applications to be abandoned or lapse, it can create opportunities for competitors to enter the market, which would hurt our competitive position and could impair our ability to successfully commercialize our products.\nPatent terms may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our product candidates for an adequate amount of time.\nThe term of any individual patent depends on applicable law in the country where the patent is granted. In the U.S., provided all maintenance fees are timely paid, a patent generally has a term of 20 years from its application filing date or earliest claimed non-provisional filing date. Extensions may be available under certain circumstances, but the life of a patent and, correspondingly, the protection it affords is limited. Even if we or our licensors obtain patents covering our products, when the terms of all patents covering a product expire, our business may become subject to competition from products identical or similar to ours. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\nWe may be unable to patent term extension in the U.S. under the Hatch-Waxman Act and in foreign countries under similar legislation.\nIn the U.S., a patent that covers a drug product or medical device approved by the FDA may be eligible for a term extension designed to restore the period of the patent term that is lost during the premarket regulatory review process conducted by the FDA. Depending upon the timing, duration and conditions of FDA marketing approval of our products, one or more of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent term extension of up to five years for a patent covering an approved product as compensation for effective patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, and only claims covering such approved drug product, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. In the European Union, our product candidates may be eligible for term extensions based on similar legislation. In either jurisdiction, however, we may not receive an extension if we fail to apply within applicable deadlines, fail to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise fail to satisfy applicable requirements. Even if we are granted such extension, the duration of such extension may be less than our request. If we are unable to obtain a patent term extension, or if the term of any such extension is less than our request, the period during which we can enforce our patent rights for that product will be in effect shortened and our competitors may obtain approval to market competing products sooner. The resulting reduction of years of revenue from applicable products could be substantial.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations and may not adequately protect our business or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. For example:\n\u25cf others may be able to make products that are similar to our products or utilize similar technology but that are not covered by the claims of our patents or that incorporate certain technology in our products that is in the public domain;\n\u25cf we, or our future licensors or collaborators, might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the applicable issued patent or pending patent application that we own now or may own or license in the future;\n\u25cf we, or our future licensors or collaborators, might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our or their inventions;\n\u25cf we may not be able to successfully commercialize our products before our relevant patents we may have, or to which we have ownership rights through licensing agreements, expire;\n\u25cf others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf it is possible that our current or future pending patent applications will not lead to issued patents;\n\u25cf issued patents that we hold rights to may be held invalid or unenforceable, including as a result of legal challenges by our competitors or other third parties;\n\u25cf our competitors or other third parties might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets;\n\u25cf we may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;\n\u25cf the patents of others may harm our business; and\n\u25cf we may choose not to file a patent in order to maintain certain trade secrets or know-how, and a third party may subsequently file a patent covering such intellectual property.\nAny of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nOur products and operations are subject to extensive government regulation and oversight both in the U.S. and internationally.\nOur products are regulated as medical devices. We and our products are subject to extensive regulation in the U.S. and internationally including by the FDA and European Medicines Agency (\u201cEMA\u201d). The FDA, EMA and other foreign equivalents regulate, among other things, with respect to medical devices: design, development and manufacturing; testing, labeling, content and language of instructions for use and storage; clinical trials; product safety; establishment registration and device listing; marketing, sales and distribution; pre-market clearance and approval; record keeping procedures; advertising and promotion; recalls and field safety corrective actions; post-market surveillance, including\nreporting of deaths or serious injuries and malfunctions that, if they were to recur, could lead to death or serious injury; post-market approval studies; and product import and export.\nThe regulations to which we are subject are complex, have become more stringent over time and are subject to further change. There is additional uncertainty in light of the new Presidential administration in the U.S. Failure to comply with applicable regulations could jeopardize our ability to sell our products and result in enforcement actions such as: warning letters; untitled letters; Form 483s; fines; injunctions; civil penalties; termination of distribution; recalls or seizures of products; delays in the introduction of products into the market; total or partial suspension of production; refusal to grant future clearances or approvals; withdrawals or suspensions of current approvals, resulting in prohibitions on sales of our products; and in the most serious cases, criminal penalties.\nWe may not receive, or may be significantly delayed in receiving, the necessary clearances or approvals for our future products and modifications to our current products may require new 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals, and may require us to cease marketing or recall the modified products until clearances or approvals are obtained.\nAn element of our strategy is to continue to add new features and expand the indications and uses for our current products. In the U.S., before we can market a new medical device, or a new use of, new claim for or significant modification to an existing product, we must first receive either clearance under Section 510(k) of the FDCA or approval of a PMA from the FDA, unless an exemption applies. Our products are cleared with the FDA, through clearances obtained and, with the exception of the clearances relating to our OviTex PRS products, held by Aroa, under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, which permits marketing of a device if it is \u201csubstantially equivalent\u201d to an already legally-marketed \u201cpredicate\u201d device, which includes a device that has been previously cleared through the 510(k) process, a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (preamendments device), a device that was originally on the U.S. market pursuant to an approved PMA and later downclassified, or a 510(k)-exempt device. To be \u201csubstantially equivalent,\u201d the proposed device must have the same intended use as the predicate device, and either have the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or have different technological characteristics and not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness than the predicate device. Clinical data are sometimes required to support substantial equivalence. In the PMA process, the FDA must determine that a proposed device is safe and effective for its intended use based, in part, on extensive data, including, but not limited to, technical, preclinical, clinical trial, manufacturing and labeling data. The PMA process is typically required for devices that are deemed to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices. To date, our products have been the subject of cleared 510(k)s, obtained and, with the exception of the clearances relating to our OviTex PRS products, held by Aroa. For more information regarding the regulation of our products, see \u201cBusiness - Government Regulation.\u201d\nModifications to products that are approved through a PMA application generally require FDA approval. Similarly, certain modifications made to products cleared through a 510(k) may require a new 510(k) clearance. Both the PMA approval and the 510(k) clearance process can be expensive, lengthy and uncertain. The FDA\u2019s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from three to 12 months, but can last longer. The process of obtaining a PMA is much more costly and uncertain than the 510(k) clearance process and generally takes from one to three years, or even longer, from the time the application is filed with the FDA. In addition, a PMA generally requires the performance of one or more clinical trials. Despite the time, effort and cost, we cannot assure you that any particular device will be approved or cleared by the FDA. Any delay or failure to obtain necessary regulatory clearances or approvals could harm our business.\nIn the U.S., Aroa has obtained and holds 510(k) clearances from the FDA to market our OviTex products and obtained the 501(k) clearances from the FDA held by us for our OviTex PRS products. An element of our strategy is to continue to upgrade our reinforced tissue matrix products. We expect that any such modifications may require new 510(k) clearances; however, future modifications may be subject to the substantially more costly, time-consuming and uncertain PMA process. The FDA will require a PMA, rather than a 510(k) clearance for the use if OviTex PRS in breast surgery. If the FDA requires us to go through a lengthier, more rigorous examination for future products or modifications to existing products than we had expected, product introductions or modifications could be delayed or canceled, which could cause our sales to decline.\nThe FDA can delay, limit or deny clearance or approval of a device for many reasons, including:\n\u25cf we may not be able to demonstrate to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction that the product or modification is substantially equivalent to the proposed predicate device or safe and effective for its intended use;\n\u25cf the data from our preclinical studies and clinical trials may be insufficient to support clearance or approval, where required; and\n\u25cf the manufacturing process or facilities we use may not meet applicable requirements.\nIn addition, the FDA may change its clearance and approval policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take other actions which may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our future products under development. For example, in January 2019, the agency finalized guidance outlining the framework for the Safety and Performance Based Pathway. This option for 510(k) clearance will allow manufacturers to use objective performance criteria established or recognized by the FDA to facilitate demonstration of substantial equivalence of their new products to legally marketed devices. This new pathway will ensure that the performance characteristics of new devices are evaluated against a set of objective, transparent and well-validated safety and performance metrics. Devices using this pathway will still have to meet current standards for reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness before they can be marketed.\nEven after we have obtained the proper regulatory clearance or approval to market a product, we have ongoing responsibilities under FDA regulations. The failure to comply with applicable regulations could jeopardize our ability to sell our reinforced tissue matrix products and result in enforcement actions such as:\n\u25cf warning letters, untitled letters or Form 483s;\n\u25cf fines;\n\u25cf injunctions;\n\u25cf civil penalties;\n\u25cf termination of distribution;\n\u25cf recalls or seizures of products;\n\u25cf delays in the introduction of products into the market;\n\u25cf total or partial suspension of production;\n\u25cf refusal to grant future clearances or approvals;\n\u25cf withdrawals or suspensions of current clearances or approvals, resulting in prohibitions on sales of our products; and\n\u25cf in the most serious cases, criminal penalties.\nAny of these sanctions could result in higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated sales and harm our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, regulators may determine that our financial relationships with our principal investigators resulted in a perceived or actual conflict of interest that may have affected the interpretation of a study. Principal investigators for our clinical trials may serve as speakers or consultants to us from time to time and receive compensation in connection with\nsuch services. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to report some of these relationships to the FDA or other regulatory authority. The FDA or other regulatory authority may conclude that a financial relationship between us and a principal investigator has created a conflict of interest or otherwise affected interpretation of the study. The FDA or other regulatory authority may therefore question the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site and the utility of the clinical trial itself may be jeopardized. This could result in a delay in approval, or rejection, of our marketing applications by the FDA or other regulatory authority, as the case may be, and may ultimately lead to the denial of marketing approval of one or more of our future products.\nTo sell our products in member countries of the EEA our products must comply with the essential requirements of the EU Medical Devices Regulation (Regulation 2017/745) (\u201cMDR\u201d), which was passed by the EU Parliament on April 5, 2017, and became effective on May 26, 2021. The MDR repeals and replaces the former Medical Devices Directive (Council Directive 93/42/EEC) and the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive (Council Directive 90/385/EEC). Compliance with the new MDR requirements is a prerequisite to be able to affix the Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne, or CE, mark to our products, without which they cannot be sold or marketed in the EEA. In the EEA, we have obtained the CE mark for our OviTex products. For more information regarding regulation of our products, see \u201cBusiness-Government Regulation.\u201d\nAn element of our strategy is to continue to add new features and expand the indications and uses for our current products. Any modification to a 510(k)-cleared device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, design or manufacture, requires a new 510(k) clearance or, possibly, approval of a PMA. The FDA requires every manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance, but the FDA may review any manufacturer\u2019s decision. The FDA may not agree with our decisions regarding whether new clearances or approvals are necessary. Such modifications can be expensive and uncertain in time and outcome. We may not be able to obtain additional 510(k) clearances or PMAs for new products or for modifications to, or additional indications for, our products in a timely fashion, or at all. Delays in obtaining required future clearances or approvals would adversely affect our ability to introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner, which in turn would harm our future growth. We have made modifications to our products in the past and expect to make additional modifications in the future that we believe do not or will not require additional clearances or approvals. If the FDA disagrees and requires new clearances or approvals for these modifications, we may be required to recall and to stop selling or marketing such products as modified until we obtain clearance or approval, which could harm our operating results and require us to redesign such products. In these circumstances, we may be subject to significant enforcement actions, including significant fines or penalties.\nInternational regulatory approval processes may take more or less time than the FDA clearance or approval process. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA and comparable non-U.S. regulatory requirements, we may not receive regulatory clearances or approvals or may be subject to FDA or comparable non-U.S. enforcement actions.\nWe may be unable to obtain future regulatory clearance or approval in a timely manner, or at all, especially if existing regulations are changed or new regulations are adopted. For example, the FDA clearance or approval process can take longer than anticipated due to requests for additional clinical data and changes in regulatory requirements. A failure or delay in obtaining necessary regulatory clearances or approvals would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough we have obtained regulatory clearance for our products, they will remain subject to extensive regulatory scrutiny.\nWe are subject to ongoing and pervasive regulatory requirements governing, among other things, the manufacturing, marketing, advertising, medical device reporting, selling and promoting our products. For example, we must submit periodic reports to the FDA as a condition of our clearance under Section 510(k). These reports include safety and effectiveness information about the device after its clearance. Failure to submit such reports, or failure to submit the reports in a timely manner, could result in enforcement action by the FDA.\nEven after we have obtained the proper regulatory approval to market our products, they will be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements for design, development, manufacturing, testing, labeling, packaging, storage, advertising,\npromotion, sampling, record-keeping, recalls and field safety corrective actions, conduct of post-marketing studies and submission of safety, effectiveness and other post-market information, including both federal and state requirements in the U.S. and requirements of comparable non-U.S. regulatory authorities. Our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the FDA, EMA and applicable state regulatory authorities, which may include any of the following sanctions:\n\u25cf issue warning or untitled letters that would result in adverse publicity or may require corrective advertising;\n\u25cf fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;\n\u25cf recalls, termination of distribution, administrative detention, or seizure of our products;\n\u25cf customer notifications or repair, replacement or refunds;\n\u25cf operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n\u25cf delays in or refusal to grant our requests for future clearances under Section 510(k) or pre-market approvals or EU regulatory approvals of new products, new intended uses, or modifications to existing products;\n\u25cf withdrawal or suspension of regulatory clearances or approvals;\n\u25cf FDA refusal to issue certificates to non-U.S. governments needed to export products for sale in other countries; and\n\u25cf criminal prosecution.\nAny government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response, and could generate negative publicity. Any failure to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements may significantly and adversely affect our ability to commercialize and generate revenue from our products. If regulatory sanctions are applied or if regulatory clearance or approval is withdrawn, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur products must be manufactured in accordance with federal and state regulations, and we could be forced to recall our products or terminate production if we fail to comply with these regulations.\nThe methods used in, and the facilities used for, the manufacture of our products must comply with the FDA\u2019s QSR which is a complex regulatory scheme that covers the procedures and documentation of the design, testing, production, process controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, handling, storage, distribution, installation, servicing and shipping of medical devices. Furthermore, Aroa must maintain facilities, procedures and operations that comply with our quality standards and applicable regulatory requirements. The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic announced or unannounced inspections of medical device manufacturing facilities, which may include the facilities of subcontractors. Our products are also subject to similar state regulations and various EU laws and regulations governing manufacturing.\nAroa may not take the necessary steps to comply with applicable regulations, which could cause delays in the delivery of our products. For example, following an inspection in March 2017, Aroa received an FDA Form 483 that contained multiple observations related to its manufacturing processes and procedures. In addition, failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements or later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products or manufacturing processes could result in, among other things: untitled letters or warning letters; fines, injunctions or civil penalties; suspension or withdrawal of approvals; seizures or recalls of our products; total or partial suspension of production or distribution; administrative or judicially imposed sanctions; the FDA\u2019s refusal to grant pending or future clearances or approvals for our products; clinical holds; refusal to permit the import or export of our products; and criminal prosecution of us or our employees.\nAny of these actions could significantly and negatively affect supply of our products. If any of these events occurs, our reputation could be harmed, we could be exposed to product liability claims and we could lose customers and experience reduced sales and increased costs.\nIf guidelines for soft-tissue reconstruction surgery change or the standard of care evolves, we may need to redesign and seek new marketing authorization from the FDA for our OviTex and OviTex PRS products or other products we may commercialize in the future.\nIf guidelines for soft-tissue reconstruction surgery change or the standard of care for reconstructing tissue evolves, we may need to redesign the applicable product and seek new approvals from the FDA. Our clearances under Section 510(k) of the FDCA are based on current soft-tissue reconstruction surgery guidelines. If the guidelines change so that different surgeries or products become desirable, the clinical utility of one or more of our OviTex and OviTex PRS products or other products we may commercialize in the future could be diminished and our business could be adversely affected.\nIf any of our products cause or contribute to a death, serious injury, or other adverse medical events, or malfunction in certain ways, we will be required to report these events to FDA and other comparable regulatory authorities under applicable medical device reporting regulations, which can result in voluntary corrective actions or agency enforcement actions. If we fail to comply with our reporting obligations, we would be subject to sanctions that could harm our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. The discovery of serious safety issues with our products, or a recall of our products either voluntarily or at the direction of the FDA or another governmental authority, could have a negative impact on us.\nWe are subject to the FDA\u2019s medical device reporting regulations and similar EU and other foreign regulations, which require us to report to the FDA when we receive or become aware of information that reasonably suggests that one or more of our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that, if the malfunction were to recur, could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. The timing of our obligation to report is triggered by the date we become aware of the adverse event as well as the nature of the event. We may fail to report adverse events of which we become aware within the prescribed timeframe. We may also fail to recognize that we have become aware of a reportable adverse event, especially if it is not reported to us as an adverse event or if it is an adverse event that is unexpected or removed in time from the use of the product. If we fail to comply with our reporting obligations, the FDA could take action, including untitled letters, warning letters, administrative actions, criminal prosecution, imposition of civil monetary penalties, revocation of related approvals, seizure of our products or delay in clearance or approval of future products.\nThe FDA and foreign regulatory agencies have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture of a product or in the event that a product poses an unacceptable risk to health. The FDA\u2019s authority to require a recall must be based on a finding that there is reasonable probability that the device could cause serious injury or death. We may also choose to voluntarily recall a product if any material deficiency is found. For example, in April 2018, Aroa, as the product manufacturer, issued a voluntary recall of our resorbable OviTex products due to a reduction in the labeled shelf life of such products from 24 months to 18 months. The recall included a total of 1,974 units from 48 manufacturing lots and was ultimately terminated in April 2019. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us could also occur as a result of an unacceptable risk to health, component failures, malfunctions, manufacturing defects, labeling or design deficiencies, packaging defects or other deficiencies or failures to comply with applicable regulations. Product defects or other errors may occur in the future.\nDepending on the corrective action we take to redress a product\u2019s deficiencies or defects, the FDA may require, or we may decide, that we will need to obtain new clearances or approvals for the device before we may market or distribute the corrected device. Seeking such approvals may delay our ability to replace the recalled devices in a timely manner. Moreover, if we do not adequately address problems associated with our devices, we may face additional regulatory enforcement action, including FDA warning letters, product seizure, injunctions, administrative penalties or civil or criminal fines.\nCompanies are required to maintain certain records of recalls and corrections, even if they are not reportable to the FDA. We may initiate voluntary withdrawals or corrections for our products in the future that we determine do not require notification of the FDA. If the FDA disagrees with our determinations, it could require us to report those actions as recalls and we may be subject to enforcement action. A future recall announcement could harm our reputation with customers, potentially lead to product liability claims against us and negatively affect our sales. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, as well as defending ourselves in a lawsuit, will require the dedication of our time and capital, distract management from operating our business and may harm our reputation and financial results.\nLegislative or regulatory reforms may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory clearances or approvals for our products or to manufacture, market or distribute our products after clearance or approval is obtained.\nFrom time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the regulation of medical devices, or the FDA may change its clearance and approval policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take other actions which may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our future products under development. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the FDA in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. Any new statutes, regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of any future products or make it more difficult to obtain clearance of or approval for, manufacture, market or distribute our products. We cannot determine what effect changes in regulations, statutes, legal interpretation or policies, when and if promulgated, enacted or adopted may have on our business in the future. Such changes could, among other things, require: additional testing prior to obtaining clearance or approval; changes to manufacturing methods; recall, replacement or discontinuance of our products; or additional record keeping.\nThe FDA\u2019s and other regulatory authorities\u2019 policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. There is additional uncertainty in light of the new Presidential administration. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the U.S. or abroad. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability.\nOn April 5, 2017, the European Parliament passed the Medical Devices Regulation (Regulation 2017/745), which repeals and replaces the EU Medical Devices Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive. Unlike directives, which must be implemented into the national laws of the EEA member states, the regulations would be directly applicable, i.e., without the need for adoption of EEA member state laws implementing them, in all EEA member states and are intended to eliminate current differences in the regulation of medical devices among EEA member states. The Medical Devices Regulation is intended to, among other things, establish a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EEA for medical devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation.\nThe MDR became fully effective on May 26, 2021. It includes new regulations which, among other things:\n\u25cf strengthen the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance once they are available;\n\u25cf establish explicit provisions on manufacturers\u2019 responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market;\n\u25cf improve the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique identification number;\n\u25cf establish a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the EU; and\n\u25cf strengthen rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market.\nFailure to comply with these regulations may harm our business.\nChanges in funding for the FDA and other government agencies could hinder their ability to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel, or otherwise prevent new products and services from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner.\nThe ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory, and policy changes. Average review times at the FDA have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of other government agencies that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. There is additional uncertainty in light of the new Presidential administration.\nDisruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new devices to be reviewed and/or approved or cleared by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. For example, over the last several years, the U.S. government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, have had to furlough critical FDA employees and stop critical activities. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur relationships with surgeons, patients and payors in the U.S. are subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse laws and regulations.\nOur current and future operations with respect to the commercialization of our products are subject to various U.S. federal and state healthcare laws and regulations. These laws impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing, support and education programs and constrain our business and financial arrangements and relationships with third-party payors, surgeons and other healthcare professionals. The laws are described in greater detail in the section below under \u201cBusiness - Government Regulation,\u201d and include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;\n\u25cf the U.S. federal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act (which can be enforced through \u201cqui tam,\u201d or whistleblower actions, by private citizens on behalf of the federal government), which prohibits any person from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment of government funds or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay money to the government or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the U.S. federal government;\n\u25cf the U.S. federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 which imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement, in connection with the delivery of, or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services by a healthcare benefit program, which includes both government and privately funded benefits programs; similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a\nperson or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;\n\u25cf the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, implemented as the Open Payments program, and its implementing regulations, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies that are reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program to report annually to the Centers for Medicare and Medicare Services, or CMS, information related to certain payments made in the preceding calendar year and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and\n\u25cf state laws and regulations, including state anti-kickback and false claims laws, that may apply to our business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including private insurers; state laws that require medical device companies to comply with the medical device industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; and state laws and regulations that require drug and device manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information, which requires tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities.\nThe shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with different compliance or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare or medical device company may fail to comply fully with one or more of these requirements. Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations may involve substantial costs. Certain physicians who influence the ordering or use of our products in procedures they perform have ownership interests in us and/or receive compensation for consulting services provided to us. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations or guidance.\nTo enforce compliance with healthcare regulatory laws, certain enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Responding to investigations can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert management\u2019s attention from the business. Additionally, as a result of these investigations, healthcare providers and entities may also have to agree to additional compliance and reporting requirements as part of a consent decree or corporate integrity agreement. Any such investigation or settlements could increase our costs or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business. Even an unsuccessful challenge or investigation into our practices could cause adverse publicity and be costly to respond to.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, additional oversight and reporting requirements if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to the same criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.\nWe are subject to anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and anti-money laundering laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, in which violations of these laws could result in substantial penalties and prosecution.\nWe are exposed to trade and economic sanctions and other restrictions imposed by the U.S. and other governments and organizations. The U.S. Departments of Justice, Commerce, State and Treasury and other federal agencies and authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seek to impose against corporations and individuals for violations of economic sanctions laws, export control laws, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the\nFCPA, and other federal statutes and regulations, including those established by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. In addition, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 (\u201cBribery Act\u201d), prohibits both domestic and international bribery, as well as bribery across both private and public sectors. An organization that \u201cfails to prevent bribery\u201d by anyone associated with the organization can be charged under the Bribery Act unless the organization can establish the defense of having implemented \u201cadequate procedures\u201d to prevent bribery. Under these laws and regulations, as well as other anti-corruption laws, anti-money laundering laws, export control laws, customs laws, sanctions laws and other laws governing our operations, various government agencies may require export licenses, may seek to impose modifications to business practices, including cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries or with sanctioned persons or entities and modifications to compliance programs, which may increase compliance costs, and may subject us to fines, penalties and other sanctions. A violation of these laws or regulations would negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face risks related to our collection and use of data, which could result in investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines, legislative and regulatory action and negative press about our privacy and data protection practices.\nOur business processes personal data, including some data related to health. When conducting clinical trials, we face risks associated with collecting trial participants\u2019 data, especially health data, in a manner consistent with applicable laws and regulations. We also face risks inherent in handling large volumes of data and in protecting the security of such data. We could be subject to attacks on our systems by outside parties or fraudulent or inappropriate behavior by our service providers or employees. Third parties may also gain access to users\u2019 accounts using stolen or inferred credentials, computer malware, viruses, spamming, phishing attacks or other means, and may use such access to obtain users\u2019 personal data or prevent use of their accounts. Further, our general liability insurance and corporate risk program may not cover all potential claims to which we are exposed and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed.\nAs our operations and business grow, we may become subject to or affected by new or additional data protection laws and regulations and face increased scrutiny or attention from regulatory authorities. In the U.S., HIPAA imposes, among other things, certain standards relating to the privacy, security, transmission and breach reporting of individually identifiable health information. Certain states have also adopted comparable privacy and security laws and regulations, some of which may be more stringent than HIPAA. Such laws and regulations will be subject to interpretation by various courts and other governmental authorities, thus creating potentially complex compliance issues for us and our future customers and strategic partners. In addition, California enacted the CCPA on June 28, 2018, which took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA created individual privacy rights for California consumers and increased the privacy and security obligations of entities handling certain personal data. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches in certain instances that is expected to increase data breach litigation. The CCPA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability, and many similar laws have been proposed at the federal level and in other states. Additionally, a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act, or the CPRA, was approved by California voters in the election of November 3, 2020. The CPRA, which will take effect in most material respects on January 1, 2023, modifies the CCPA significantly, potentially resulting in further uncertainty and requiring us to incur additional costs and expenses to comply. A failure to comply with these current or future federal and state laws and regulations and industry standards relating to data privacy and security could lead to investigatory or regulatory action, private litigation or class actions that could result in exposure to civil or criminal penalties, monetary or statutory damages, attorney fee awards and/or exposure to adverse publicity that could negatively affect our operating results and business.\nThis risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions as we expand our operations internationally. The EU\u2019s GDPR became effective in May 2018. The GDPR applies extraterritorially and imposes several stringent requirements for controllers and processors of personal data, of data subjects residing in the European Economic Area. For example, the GDPR imposes higher standards for obtaining consent from individuals to process their personal data, more robust disclosures to individuals and a strengthened individual data rights regime, shortened timelines for data breach notifications, limitations on retention of information, increased requirements pertaining to special categories of personal data and pseudonymised (i.e., key-coded) data and additional obligations when we contract third-party processors in connection with the processing of the personal data. This risk is increased because the GDPR provides that EU member states may make their own laws and regulations limiting the processing of personal data, including special categories of data\n(e.g., racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs) and profiling and automated individual decision-making of individuals, which could limit our ability to use and share personal data or other data and could cause our compliance costs and liability risks to increase, harming our business and financial condition.\nThe GDPR also regulates cross-border transfers of personal data and requires transferee countries to have protections equivalent to protections available in the EU. Because of the uncertainty created by the Court of Justice of the European Union\u2019s decision invalidating the EU/US Privacy Shield (the primary mechanism to effectuate the flow of data from the EU to the United States), there continues to be uncertainty as to appropriate transfer mechanism for the transfer of data from the EU to the United States. Further, the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union, referred to as Brexit, has created uncertainty regarding data protection regulation in the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom has transposed the GDPR into domestic law with a United Kingdom version of the GDPR that took effect in January 2021 (UK GDPR). The UK GDPR could expose us or our collaborators to two parallel regimes, each of which potentially authorizes similar fines and other potentially divergent enforcement actions for violations. In addition, uncertainties related to compliance with the GDPR exist with respect to the UK GDPR. Non-compliance with GDPR is subject to significant penalties, including fines of up to \u20ac20.0 million or 4% of total worldwide revenue, whichever is greater. The implementation and enforcement of the GDPR may subject us to enforcement risk and requirements to change certain of our data collection, processing and other policies and practices. We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, if we are found liable, significant damages. If any of these events were to occur, our business and financial results could be adversely affected. Other jurisdictions outside the EU are similarly introducing or enhancing laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security, which enhances risks relating to compliance with such laws.\nCompliance with U.S. federal and state laws and foreign data protection laws and regulations could require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts, restrict our ability to collect, use and disclose data, or in some cases, impact our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions. Failure to comply with United States and foreign data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions (which could include civil or criminal penalties), private litigation, and/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business. And claims that we have violated individuals\u2019 privacy rights, failed to comply with data protection laws or breached our contractual obligations, even if we are not found liable, could be expensive and time-consuming to defend, could result in adverse publicity and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nThe Affordable Care Act and any changes in healthcare law may increase the difficulty and cost for us to successfully commercialize our products and affect the prices we may obtain.\nIn the United States, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively the Affordable Care Act, substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the healthcare industry. The Affordable Care Act is intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against healthcare fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers, and impose additional health policy reforms.\nThere have been significant ongoing judicial, administrative, executive and legislative efforts to modify or eliminate the Affordable Care Act. For example, the Tax Act enacted on December 22, 2017, repealed the shared responsibility payment for individuals who fail to maintain minimum essential coverage under section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code, commonly referred to as the individual mandate. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since passage of the Affordable Care Act. The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of an amount greater than $1.2 trillion for the fiscal years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation\u2019s automatic reductions to several government programs. These reductions included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to healthcare providers of up to 2.0% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013. Subsequent litigation extended the 2% reduction, on average, to 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, which was\ndesigned to provide financial support and resources to individuals and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, suspended the 2% Medicare sequester from May 1, 2020 to December 31, 2021. The sequester will remain in place through 2030. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.\nThe Affordable Care Act has been subject to challenges in the courts. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d was repealed by Congress. On December 18, 2019, the Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals held that the individual mandate is unconstitutional and remanded the case to the Texas District Court to reconsider its earlier invalidation of the entire Affordable Care Act. An appeal was taken to the U.S. Supreme Court. On June 17, 2021, the Supreme Court ruled that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the law as they had not alleged personal injury traceable to the allegedly unlawful conduct. As a result, the Supreme Court did not rule on the constitutionality of the ACA or any of its provisions.\nFurther changes to and under the Affordable Care Act remain possible, but it is unknown what form any such changes or any law proposed to replace or revise the Affordable Care Act would take, and how or whether it may affect our business in the future.\nAt the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control healthcare costs, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.\nWe expect that additional federal, state and foreign healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in limited coverage and reimbursement and reduced demand for our products, once approved, or additional pricing pressures. and could seriously harm our future revenues. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid, or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain and maintain profitability of our product and product candidates, if approved.\nOur business involves the use of hazardous materials and we and Aroa must comply with environmental laws and regulations, which may be expensive and restrict how we do business.\nAroa\u2019s activities in manufacturing our products may involve the controlled storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials. Aroa is or may be subject to federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials. We currently carry no insurance specifically covering environmental claims relating to the use of hazardous materials.\nAlthough we believe that Aroa\u2019s safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials and waste products comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from the use, storage, handling or disposal of hazardous materials. In the event of an accident, federal, state or other applicable authorities may curtail Aroa\u2019s use of these materials and interrupt their business operations which could adversely affect our business.\nCompliance with environmental laws and regulations may be expensive and non-compliance could result in substantial liabilities, fines and penalties, personal injury and third-party property damage claims and substantial investigation and remediation costs. Environmental laws and regulations could become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations. We cannot assure you that violations of these laws and regulations will not occur in the future or have not occurred in the past as a result of human error, accidents, equipment failure or other causes. The expense associated with environmental regulation and remediation could harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Products\nOur financial results may fluctuate significantly and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business.\nOur quarterly and annual results of operations may vary significantly in the future, and period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful. Accordingly, the results of any one quarter or period should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our quarterly and annual financial results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside our control.\nFactors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results include:\n\u25cf surgeon and patient adoption of our products;\n\u25cf timing of new product offerings, acquisitions, licenses or other significant events by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf changes in coverage policies by third-party payors that affect the reimbursement of procedures in which our products are used;\n\u25cf unanticipated pricing pressure;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory clearance or approval for any products in development or for our current products for additional indications or in additional jurisdictions;\n\u25cf the hiring, retention and continued productivity of our sales representatives;\n\u25cf our ability to expand the geographic reach of our sales and marketing efforts;\n\u25cf results of clinical research and trials on our existing products and products in development;\n\u25cf delays in, or failure of, component and raw material deliveries by Aroa;\n\u25cf recalls or other field safety corrective actions by Aroa;\n\u25cf business interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods or public health emergencies such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u25cf positive or negative coverage in the media or clinical publications of our products or products of our competitors or our industry.\nBecause our quarterly and annual results may fluctuate, period-to-period comparisons may not be the best indication of the underlying results of our business. In particular, we cannot predict at this time the extent of the impact that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic will have on our sales and financial results. These fluctuations may also increase the likelihood that we will not meet our forecasted performance, which could negatively affect the market price for our common stock.\nWe may be unable to compete successfully with larger competitors in our highly competitive industry.\nThe medical device industry is intensely competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants. Our competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, management and commercial personnel, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our products. Because of the complex and technical nature of our products and the dynamic market in which we compete, any failure to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees could\nmaterially harm our ability to develop and commercialize our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the U.S., we currently compete with LifeCell Corporation, a subsidiary of AbbVie, and Davol Inc., a subsidiary of Becton, Dickinson and Company, which produce, among other things, soft-tissue reconstruction surgery products, including Strattice and Phasix, respectively. In the EEA, we compete with Bard, a subsidiary of Becton, Dickinson and Company, who produces other soft-tissue reinforcement products. Many of these competitors are large, well-capitalized companies with significantly greater market share and resources than us. As a consequence, they are able to spend more on product development, marketing, sales and other product initiatives than we can. We believe other emerging businesses are in the early stages of developing similar products designed for soft-tissue reconstruction surgery. Although we are the only ovine-derived implantable product designed for soft-tissue reconstruction surgery, there are other soft tissue reconstruction surgery products derived solely, or in part, from other biological sources.\nMost of the other soft-tissue reconstruction surgery products currently have a greater penetration into the soft tissue reconstruction surgery market. Often, other soft-tissue reconstruction surgery products with which our products compete are marketed as part of a bundled product line, which may provide our potential customers a better price-per-product than we could offer. If we are unable to penetrate the soft-tissue reconstruction surgery market or offer competitive pricing on our products compared with products sold as part of a bundled product line, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, competitors with greater financial resources could acquire other companies to gain enhanced name recognition and market share, as well as new technologies or products that could effectively compete with our existing products, which may cause our revenue to decline and would harm our business.\nWe may be unable to renew existing contracts with GPOs or obtain additional contract positions with major GPOs and integrated delivery networks, or IDNs, for our products, and even if we are able to do so, such contracts may not generate sufficient sales of our products.\nMany existing and potential customers for our products within the U.S. are members of GPOs and IDNs, including accountable care organizations or public-based purchasing organizations, and our business strategy is focused on entering into major contracts with these organizations. Our products can be contracted under national tenders or with larger hospital GPOs. GPOs and IDNs typically award contracts on a category-by-category basis through a competitive bidding process. We are currently responding to bids and negotiating a number of GPO and IDN agreements.\nWe may not be able to renew existing contracts with GPOs or IDNs and due to the highly competitive nature of the bidding process and the GPO and IDN contracting processes in the U.S., we may not be able to obtain additional contract positions with major GPOs and IDNs for our products. If we are unable to renew existing contracts with GPOs or IDNs, our net sales and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, while having a contract with a major purchaser for a given product category can facilitate sales, sales volumes of those products may not be maintained. For example, GPOs and IDNs are increasingly awarding contracts to multiple suppliers for the same product category. Even if we are the sole contracted supplier of a GPO or IDN for our product category, members of the GPO or IDN generally are free to purchase from other suppliers. Furthermore, GPO and IDN contracts typically are terminable without cause upon 60 to 90 days\u2019 notice.\nSupply chain disruptions could adversely impact our operations and financial condition.\nGlobal supply chains have been disrupted because of the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors, and this may impact the availability of raw materials and components used in the manufacture of our products. Additionally, even when we and our suppliers are able to source such materials and components, they may cost more and may only be available on a delayed basis. Higher materials and component costs could adversely affect our margins if we are unable to pass such costs along to customers in the form of price increases. Delays in receipt of materials and components could also interrupt our production and cause us to go into backorder on certain of our products, further exacerbating the effect of the global supply chain disruption.\nWe face the risk of product liability claims that could be expensive, divert management\u2019s attention and harm our reputation and business.\nOur business exposes us to the risk of product liability claims that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of medical devices. This risk exists even if a product is cleared or approved for commercial sale by the FDA or EMA, and manufactured in facilities licensed and regulated by the FDA or EMA. Any side effects, manufacturing defects or misuse associated with our products could result in patient injury or death. The industry in which we operate has historically been subject to extensive litigation over product liability claims, and we cannot offer any assurance that we will not face product liability suits. We may be subject to product liability claims if our products cause, or merely appear to have caused, patient injury or death. In addition, an injury that is caused by the activities of Aroa may be the basis for a claim against us. Product liability claims may be brought against us by patients, healthcare providers or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our products. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we will incur substantial liabilities and reputational harm. In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in substantial litigation costs, product recalls or market withdrawals, decreased sales and demand for our products and damage to our reputation.\nWhile we may attempt to manage our product liability exposure by proactively recalling or withdrawing from the market any defective products, any recall or market withdrawal of our products may delay the supply of those products to our customers and may impact our reputation. We can provide no assurance that we will be successful in initiating appropriate market recall or market withdrawal efforts that may be required in the future or that these efforts will have the intended effect of preventing product malfunctions and the accompanying product liability that may result. Such recalls and withdrawals may also be used by our competitors to harm our reputation for safety or be perceived by patients as a safety risk when considering the use of our products, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough we have product liability insurance that we believe is appropriate, this insurance is subject to deductibles and coverage limitations. In addition, our current product liability insurance may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all, and, if available, coverage may not be adequate to protect us against any future product liability claims. A product liability claim, recall or other claim with respect to uninsured liabilities or for amounts in excess of insured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe continuing development of our products depends upon our maintaining strong working relationships with surgeons.\nThe research, development, marketing and sale of our current and future products and any future product indications for which we receive regulatory clearance or approval depend upon our maintaining working relationships with surgeons. We rely on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and experience regarding the development, marketing and sale of our products. Surgeons assist us in clinical trials and in marketing, and as researchers, product consultants and public speakers. If we cannot maintain our strong working relationships with these professionals and continue to receive their advice and input, the development and marketing of our products could suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. At the same time, the medical device industry\u2019s relationship with surgeons is under increasing scrutiny by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (\u201cOIG\u201d), the U.S. Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d), the state attorneys general and other foreign and domestic government agencies. Our failure to comply with requirements governing the industry\u2019s relationships with surgeons or an investigation into our compliance by the OIG, the DOJ, state attorneys general and other government agencies, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional information regarding the laws impacting our relationships with surgeons and other healthcare professionals can be found above under \u201cRisks Related to Government Regulation.\u201d\nWe have limited data and experience regarding the safety and efficacy of our products. Results of earlier studies may not be predictive of future clinical trial results, or the safety or efficacy profile for such products.\nOur single arm multicenter post-market clinical study, which we refer to as our BRAVO study, was fully enrolled at 92 patients. We conducted this study to support the marketing of our OviTex products for their cleared indicated uses, and do not currently have any clinical data for use of our OviTex PRS products in patients. The long-term effects of using our products in a large number of patients have not been studied and the results of short-term clinical use of such products do not necessarily predict long-term clinical benefits or reveal long-term adverse effects. The results of preclinical studies and clinical studies of our products conducted to date and ongoing or future studies and trials of our current, planned or future products may not be predictive of the results of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. Our interpretation of data and results from our clinical trials do not ensure that we will achieve similar results in future clinical trials in other patient populations. In addition, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to various interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their products performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and earlier clinical trials have nonetheless failed to replicate results in later clinical trials. Products in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy despite having progressed through nonclinical studies and earlier clinical trials.\nInterim or preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time may change as more patient data become available and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data.\nFrom time to time, we may publicly disclose interim or preliminary data from our BRAVO studies or other clinical studies that we may conduct in the future, which is based on a preliminary analysis of then-available data, and the results and related findings and conclusions are subject to change following a full analyses of all data related to the particular trial. We also make assumptions, estimations, calculations and conclusions as part of our analyses of data, and we may not have received or had the opportunity to fully and carefully evaluate all data. As a result, the interim results that we report may differ from future results of the same trials, or different conclusions or considerations may qualify such results, once additional data have been received and fully evaluated. Interim or preliminary data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published. As a result, interim or preliminary data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. We may also disclose interim data from our clinical trials. Interim data from clinical trials that we may complete are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available. Adverse differences between preliminary or interim data and final data could significantly harm our business prospects.\nFurther, others, including regulatory agencies, may not accept or agree with our assumptions, estimates, calculations, conclusions or analyses or may interpret or weigh the importance of data differently, which could impact the value of the particular program, the approvability or commercialization of the particular product candidate or product and our business in general. In addition, the information we choose to publicly disclose regarding a particular study or clinical trial is based on what is typically extensive information, and you or others may not agree with what we determine is the material or otherwise appropriate information to include in our disclosure, and any information we determine not to disclose may ultimately be deemed significant with respect to future decisions, conclusions, views, activities or otherwise regarding a particular drug, product candidate or our business. If the interim or preliminary data that we report differ from actual results, or if others, including regulatory authorities, disagree with the conclusions reached, our ability to use such results to support the marketing of our products may be jeopardized.\nThe sizes of the markets for our current and future products have not been established with precision, and may be smaller than we estimate.\nOur estimates of the annual total addressable markets for our current products and products under development are based on a number of internal and third-party estimates, including, without limitation, the number of hernia and soft-tissue reconstruction surgery patients and overall market and the assumed prices at which we can sell our products. While we believe our assumptions and the data underlying our estimates are reasonable, these assumptions and estimates may not be correct and the conditions supporting our assumptions or estimates may change at any time, thereby reducing the\npredictive accuracy of these underlying factors. As a result, our estimates of the annual total addressable market for our products may prove to be incorrect. If the price at which we can sell future products, or the annual total addressable market for our products is smaller than we have estimated, it may impair our sales growth and have an adverse impact on our business.\nOur results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast customer demand for our products and manage our inventory.\nOur reinforced tissue matrix products have a limited shelf life and will expire if not timely used. To ensure adequate inventory supply, we must forecast inventory needs and place orders with Aroa based on our estimates of future demand for our reinforced tissue matrix products. Our ability to accurately forecast demand for such products could be negatively affected by many factors, including:\n\u25cf product introductions by competitors;\n\u25cf an increase or decrease in surgeon demand for our products or for products of our competitors;\n\u25cf our failure to accurately manage our expansion strategy;\n\u25cf our failure to accurately forecast surgeon acceptance of new products;\n\u25cf our failure to obtain contracts with a significant number of GPOs and IDNs;\n\u25cf unanticipated changes in general market conditions or regulatory matters;\n\u25cf the severity and duration of market disruptions as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak; and\n\u25cf weakening of economic conditions or consumer confidence.\nInventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs or write-offs, which would cause our gross margin to be adversely affected and could impair the strength of our brand. Additionally, we are subject to the risk that a portion of our inventory will expire, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows due to the resulting costs associated with the inventory impairment charges and costs required to replace such inventory. Conversely, if we underestimate customer demand for our products, Aroa may not be able to deliver products to meet our requirements, and this could result in damage to our reputation and customer relationships. In addition, if we experience a significant increase in demand, additional supplies of raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity may not be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or Aroa may not be able to allocate sufficient capacity to meet our increased requirements, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand for our products and our results of operations.\nWe rely on our own direct sales force for our products, which may result in higher fixed costs than our competitors and may slow our ability to reduce costs.\nWe rely on our own direct sales force, which as of December 31, 2021 consisted of 42 representatives in the U.S. and 5 representatives in Europe, to market and sell our products. A direct sales force may subject us to higher fixed costs than those of companies that market competing products through independent third parties, due to the costs that we will bear associated with employee benefits, training and managing sales personnel. As a result, we may be at a competitive disadvantage. Additionally, these fixed costs may slow our ability to reduce costs in the face of a sudden decline in demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial partners, distributors and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial partners and vendors may engage in fraudulent or illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or disclosure of unauthorized activities to us that violates: (i) the rules of the FDA and other similar foreign regulatory bodies; (ii) manufacturing standards; (iii) healthcare fraud and abuse laws in the U.S. and similar foreign fraudulent misconduct laws; (iv) data privacy laws and other similar non-U.S. laws; or (v) laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data. These laws may impact, among other things, future sales, marketing and education programs.\nIt is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by our employees and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent these activities may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. In addition, we are subject to the risk that a person or government could allege such fraud or other misconduct, even if none occurred. If any such actions are instituted against us and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could result in the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, additional integrity reporting and oversight obligations and possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. Whether or not we are successful in defending against any such actions or investigations, we could incur substantial costs, including legal fees, and divert the attention of management in defending ourselves against any of these claims or investigations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could be adversely affected by any interruption to our ability to conduct business at our current location.\nWe do not have redundant facilities. We perform substantially all of our research and development and back office activity and maintain all our finished goods inventory in a single location in Malvern, Pennsylvania. Our facility, equipment and inventory would be costly to replace and could require substantial lead time to repair or replace. The facility may be harmed or rendered inoperable by natural or man-made disasters, including, but not limited to, tornadoes, flooding, fire, public health emergencies such as pandemics and power outages, which may render it difficult or impossible for us to perform our customer service research, development and commercialization activities for some period of time. The inability to perform those activities, combined with the time it may take to rebuild our inventory of finished product, may result in the loss of customers or harm to our reputation. Although we possess insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and this insurance may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nIf we experience significant disruption or a breach in our information technology systems, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe rely extensively on information technology systems to conduct our business. These systems affect, among other things, ordering and managing products, shipping products to customers, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, complying with regulatory, legal and tax requirements, data security and other processes necessary to manage our business. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect, and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards, the increasing need to protect patient and customer information, and changing customer patterns. If our systems are damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, ranging from catastrophic events to power outages to security breaches, and our business continuity plans do not effectively compensate on a timely basis, we may experience interruptions in our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nIf we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively, we could lose existing customers, have difficulty attracting new customers, suffer backlash from negative public relations, have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed, have increases in operating expenses, incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy\nbreach, or suffer other adverse consequences. Furthermore, any breach in our information technology systems could lead to the unauthorized access, disclosure and use of non-public information from our patient registry or other patient information which is protected by HIPAA and other laws. Any such access, disclosure, or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information and damage to our reputation.\nIf we become profitable, our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset future taxable income or taxes may be subject to limitations.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had federal and state net operating loss carry forwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) of approximately $181.4 million and $151.5 million, respectively. The federal carry forwards for losses incurred prior to 2017 will begin expiring in 2032 for federal purposes. Federal net operating losses incurred in 2018 and onward have an indefinite expiration under the 2017 Tax Cut & Jobs Act. The state carry forwards will begin expiring in 2026. A full allowance for the value of the NOLs is provided for in our audited financial statements for the year of December 31, 2021 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We cannot guarantee what the ultimate outcome or amount of the benefit we may receive from the NOLs, if any, will be. If we become profitable in the future, our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset future taxable income or reduce taxes may be subject to limitations.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nThe trading price of the shares of our common stock has been and could in the future be highly volatile.\nThe price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile. Even though our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d), an active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained. The lack of an active trading market may impair the value of your shares and your ability to sell your shares at the time you wish to sell them. An inactive trading market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock and enter into strategic partnerships or acquire other complementary products, technologies or businesses by using shares of our common stock as consideration. Furthermore, there can be no guarantee that we will continue to satisfy the continued listing standards of Nasdaq. If we fail to satisfy the continued listing standards, we could be de-listed, which would have a negative effect on the price of our common stock.\nWe cannot predict the prices at which our shares of common stock may trade. The market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially due to many factors, including:\n\u25cf the volume and timing of sales of our products;\n\u25cf the introduction of new products or product enhancements by us or others in our industry;\n\u25cf disputes or other developments with respect to our or others\u2019 intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf our ability to develop, obtain regulatory clearance for, and market new and enhanced products on a timely basis;\n\u25cf product liability claims or other litigation;\n\u25cf quarterly variations in our results of operations or those of others in our industry;\n\u25cf media exposure of our products or of those of others in our industry;\n\u25cf changes in governmental regulations or in reimbursement;\n\u25cf changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts; and\n\u25cf general market conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors, including any economic downturn as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, or macroeconomic factors such as geopolitical tensions or the outbreak of hostilities or war.\nIn recent years, the stock markets generally have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Broad market and industry factors may significantly affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nIn addition, in the past, class action litigation has often been instituted against companies whose securities have experienced periods of volatility in market price. Securities litigation brought against us following volatility in our stock price, regardless of the merit or ultimate results of such litigation, could result in substantial costs, which would hurt our financial condition and operating results and divert management\u2019s attention and resources from our business.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nWe currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. In addition, the agreement governing our credit facility precludes, and any future debt agreements may preclude us from paying cash dividends. Any future determination to declare dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other factors, our financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, general business conditions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the appreciation in the value of their stock, if any.\nOur directors, officers and principal stockholders have significant voting power and may take actions that may not be in the best interests of our other stockholders.\nOur officers, directors and principal stockholders each holding more than 5% of our common stock, collectively, control approximately 62% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders, if they act together, will be able to significantly influence our management and affairs and most matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. The interests of these stockholders may not be the same as or may even conflict with your interests. For example, these stockholders could attempt to delay or prevent a change in control, even if such change in control would benefit our other stockholders, which could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our capital stock or our assets, and might affect the prevailing market price of our common stock due to investors\u2019 perceptions that conflicts of interest may exist or arise. As a result, this concentration of ownership may not be in the best interests of our other stockholders.\nWe are an emerging growth company and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions and relief from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies.\u201d In particular, while we are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d (i) we will not be required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (ii) we will be exempt from any rules that could be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board requiring mandatory audit firm rotations or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report on financial statements, (iii) we will be subject to reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and (iv) we will not be required to hold nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation or stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nWe may remain an emerging growth company until as late as December 31, 2024, the fiscal year-end following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO, though we may cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d earlier under certain circumstances, including if (i) we have more than $1.07 billion in annual revenue in any fiscal year, (ii) the\nmarket value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30 or (iii) we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period.\nThe exact implications of the JOBS Act are still subject to interpretations and guidance by the SEC and other regulatory agencies, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to take advantage of all of the benefits of the JOBS Act. In addition, investors may find our common stock less attractive to the extent we rely on the exemptions and relief granted by the JOBS Act. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may decline or become more volatile.\nWe are at risk of securities class action litigation.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities. This risk is especially relevant for us because medical device companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years. If we face such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could harm our business.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports covering us regularly, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage another company from acquiring us and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our fourth amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our second amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of us that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. As our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by our stockholders to replace current members of our management team. These provisions provide, among other things, that:\n\u25cf our board of directors has the exclusive right to expand the size of our board of directors and to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u25cf our board of directors is divided into three classes, Class I, Class II and Class III, with each class serving staggered three-year terms, which may delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors;\n\u25cf our stockholders may not act by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u25cf a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chair of our board of directors, our chief executive officer (or president, in the absence of a chief executive officer) or a majority of our board of directors, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n\u25cf our fourth amended and restated certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u25cf our board of directors may alter certain provisions of our second amended and restated bylaws without obtaining stockholder approval;\n\u25cf the approval of the holders of at least two-thirds of our shares entitled to vote at an election of our board of directors is required to adopt, amend or repeal our second amended and restated bylaws or repeal the provisions of our fourth amended and restated certificate of incorporation regarding the election and removal of directors;\n\u25cf stockholders must provide advance notice and additional disclosures to nominate individuals for election to the board of directors or to propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain voting control of our shares; and\n\u25cf our board of directors is authorized to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (\u201cDGCL\u201d) which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nOur fourth amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur fourth amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the United State District Court for the District of Delaware) is the exclusive forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty or other wrongdoing by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or our fourth amended and restated certificate of incorporation or second amended and restated bylaws or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, except, in each case, (A) any claim as to which such court determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of such court (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of such court within 10 days following such determination), (B) which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than such court, or (C) for which such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, in all cases subject to the courts having jurisdiction over indispensable parties named as defendants. This provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. For example, stockholders who do bring a claim in the Court of Chancery could face additional litigations costs in pursuing any such claim, particularly if they do not reside in or near the State of Delaware. The Court of Chancery may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder considering an action may be located or would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments or results may be more favorable to us than to our stockholders. The enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies\u2019 certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that, in connection with any applicable action brought against us, a court could find the choice of forum provisions contained in our fourth amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in such action. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our fourth amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an\naction, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions. This provision will not apply to actions arising under the Securities Act or Exchange Act. Our fourth amended and restated certificate of incorporation and second amended and restated bylaws further provide that the federal district courts of the U.S. will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. Section 22 of the Securities Act, however, creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Accordingly, there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such a forum selection provision as written in connection with claims arising under the Securities Act.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nUnstable markets and economic conditions may adversely affect our business.\nAdverse worldwide economic conditions may negatively impact our business. Our general business strategy may be adversely affected by such economic conditions or the presence of a volatile business environment or unpredictable and unstable market conditions, such as the economic turmoil resulting from the spread of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Further, the impacts of political unrest, including as a result of geopolitical tensions, could lead to disruption, instability and volatility in the global markets, which may have an adverse impact on our business or ability to access the capital markets. Recently, the market has experienced volatility due to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the resulting sanctions and other measures imposed by the U.S. and other countries against Russia. There can be no assurances that such situation will not further deteriorate, causing increased disruption, instability and volatility in the global markets. Adverse worldwide economic conditions may also adversely impact our suppliers\u2019 ability to provide us with materials and components, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to maintain our competitive position depends on our ability to attract and retain senior management and other highly qualified personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on our senior management and other key personnel. Our success depends in part on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified senior management and attract, retain and motivate qualified employees, including sales and marketing professionals, clinical specialists and other highly skilled personnel. Competition for skilled personnel in our market is intense and may limit our ability to hire and retain highly qualified personnel on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are not successful in attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The loss of highly qualified employees could result in delays in product development and commercialization and harm our business.\nAlthough we have entered into employment agreements with all of our executive officers, each of them may terminate their employment with us at any time. The replacement of any of our key personnel likely would involve significant time and costs and may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives and could therefore have an adverse effect on our business. We also do not maintain \u201ckey man\u201d insurance policies on the lives of these individuals or the lives of any of our other employees.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\nWe are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. We designed our disclosure controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance that information we must disclose in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well those controls and procedures are conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.\nThese inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some\npersons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.", "PERMNO": 19082, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "TELA"}
