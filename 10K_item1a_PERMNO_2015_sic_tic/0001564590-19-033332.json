{"cik": "1617242", "company": "Kearny Financial Corp.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-08-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our securities is subject to risks inherent in our business and the industry in which we operate. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and all other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks described below may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition to these risks and any other risks or uncertainties described in \u201cItem 1. Business-Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. The value or market price of our securities could decline due to any of these identified or other risks. Past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nChanges in interest rates or the shape of the yield curve may adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.\nWe derive our income mainly from the difference or spread between the interest earned on loans, securities and other interest-earning assets and interest paid on deposits, borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. In general, the larger the spread, the more we earn. When market rates of interest change, the interest we receive on our assets and the interest we pay on our liabilities will fluctuate. This can cause decreases in our spread and can adversely affect our income. From an interest rate risk perspective, we have generally been liability sensitive, which indicates that liabilities re-price faster than assets.\nOver the past several years the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s Federal Open Market Committee increased its federal funds rate target from a range of 0.00% - 0.25% to a range of 2.25% - 2.50%, which was in place at June 30, 2019. In response to increases in the federal funds rate short-term rates, such as the cost of deposits and overnight borrowings, have risen while long-term rates on loans and investments have risen to a lesser extent, resulting in a flattening of the yield curve. As a result of the flattening of the yield curve, coupled with our liability sensitivity, our net interest rate spread and net interest margin are at risk of being reduced due to potential increases in our cost of funds that may outpace any increases in our yield on interest-earning assets.\nInterest rates also affect how much money we lend. For example, when interest rates rise, the cost of borrowing increases and loan originations tend to decrease. In addition, changes in interest rates can affect the average life of loans and securities. For example, a reduction in interest rates generally results in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed securities, as borrowers refinance their debt in order to reduce their borrowing cost. This causes reinvestment risk, because we generally are not able to reinvest prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates we earned on the prepaid loans or securities in a declining rate environment.\nChanges in market interest rates also impact the value of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities as well as the value of our derivatives portfolios. In particular, the unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale and changes in the fair value of interest rate derivatives serving as cash flows hedges are reported, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income which is a component of stockholders\u2019 equity. Consequently, declines in the fair value of these instruments resulting from changes in market interest rates may adversely affect stockholders\u2019 equity.\nIf our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings will decrease.\nWe make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. In determining the required amount of the allowance for loan losses, we evaluate certain loans individually and establish loan loss allowances for specifically identified impairments. For all non-impaired loans, including those not individually reviewed, we estimate losses and establish loan loss allowances based upon historical and environmental loss factors. If the assumptions used in our calculation methodology are incorrect, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, resulting in further additions to our allowance. Our allowance for loan losses was 0.70% of total loans at June 30, 2019 and significant additions to our allowance could materially decrease our net income.\nIn addition, bank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities might have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur acquisitions, and the integration of acquired businesses, subject us to various risks and may not result in all of the cost savings and benefits anticipated, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have in the past, and may in the future, seek to grow our business by acquiring other businesses. There is risk that our acquisitions may not have the anticipated positive results, including results relating to: correctly assessing the asset quality of the assets being acquired; the total cost and time required to complete the integration successfully; being able to profitably deploy funds acquired in an acquisition; or the overall performance of the combined entity.\nAcquisitions may also result in business disruptions that could cause customers to remove their accounts from us and move their business to competing financial institutions. It is possible that the integration process related to acquisitions could result in the disruption of our ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, and employees. The loss of key employees in connection with an acquisition could adversely affect our ability to successfully conduct our business. Acquisition and integration efforts could divert management attention and resources, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, the operation of the acquired branches may adversely affect our existing profitability, and we may not be able to achieve results in the future similar to those achieved by the existing banking business or manage growth resulting from the acquisition effectively.\nA new accounting standard will likely require us to increase our allowance for loan losses and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board has adopted a new accounting standard that will be effective for us for our first fiscal year after December 15, 2019. This standard, referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL, will require financial institutions to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans, and recognize the expected credit losses as allowances for loan losses. This will change the current method of providing allowances for loan losses that are probable, which would likely require us to increase our allowance for loan losses, and to greatly increase the types of data we would need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or expenses incurred to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our assets consists of investment securities, which generally have lower yields than loans, and we classify a significant portion of our investment securities as available for sale, which creates potential volatility in our equity and may have an adverse impact on our net income.\nAs of June 30, 2019, our securities portfolio totaled $1.29 billion, or 19.5% of our total assets. Investment securities typically have lower yields than loans. For the year ended June 30, 2019, the weighted average yield of our investment securities portfolio was 3.07%, as compared to 4.12% for our loan portfolio. Accordingly, our net interest margin is lower than it would have been if a higher proportion of our interest-earning assets consisted of loans. Additionally, at June 30, 2019, $714.3 million, or 55.3% of our investment securities, are classified as available for sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains or losses excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income, which affects our reported equity. Accordingly, given the significant size of the investment securities portfolio classified as available for sale and due to possible mark-to-market adjustments of that portion of the portfolio resulting from market conditions, we may experience greater volatility in the value of reported equity. Moreover, given that we actively manage our investment securities portfolio classified as available for sale, we may sell securities which could result in a realized loss, thereby reducing our net income.\nOur loan portfolio contains a significant portion of loans that are unseasoned. It is difficult to evaluate the future performance of unseasoned loans.\nOur loan portfolio has grown to $4.68 billion at June 30, 2019, from $2.10 billion at June 30, 2015. This increase reflects the acquisition of Clifton coupled with increases in commercial loans resulting from internal loan originations, as well as purchases and participations in loans originated by other financial institutions. It is difficult to assess the future performance of these loans recently added to our portfolio because our relatively limited experience with such loans does not provide us with a significant payment history from which to evaluate future collectability. These loans may experience higher delinquency or charge-off levels than our historical loan portfolio experience, which could adversely affect our future performance.\nOur increased commercial lending exposes us to additional risk.\nOur commercial loans have increased to 69.4% of total loans at June 30, 2019 from 67.3% of total loans at June 30, 2015. Our commercial lending operations include commercial mortgage loans, comprising multi-family loans and non-residential mortgage loans, commercial business loans as well as construction loans. We intend to continue increasing commercial lending as part of our ongoing transition from a traditional thrift to a full-service community bank. We have increased our commercial lending staff and continue to seek additional commercial lenders to help grow the commercial loan portfolio. Our increased commercial lending, however, exposes us to greater risks than one- to four-family residential lending. Unlike single-family, owner-occupied residential mortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrower\u2019s ability to make repayment from his or her employment and other income and are secured by real property whose value tends to be more easily ascertainable and realizable, the repayment of commercial loans typically is dependent on the successful operation and income stream of the borrower, which can be significantly affected by economic conditions, and are secured, if at all, by collateral that is more difficult to value or sell or by collateral which may depreciate in value. In addition, commercial loans generally carry larger balances to single borrowers or related groups of borrowers than one- to four-family mortgage loans, which increases the financial impact of a borrower\u2019s default.\nThe risk exposure from our increased commercial lending is also a function of the markets in which we operate. Our commercial lending activity is generally focused on borrowers domiciled, and real estate located, within the states of New Jersey and New York. Regional risk factors and changes to local laws and regulations, including changes to rent regulations or foreclosure laws, may present greater risk than a more geographically diversified portfolio.\nBecause we intend to continue to increase our commercial business loan originations, our credit risk will increase.\nHistorically we have not had a significant portfolio of commercial business loans. We intend to increase our originations of commercial business loans, including C&I and SBA loans, which generally have more risk than both one- to four-family residential and commercial mortgage loans. Since repayment of commercial business loans may depend on the successful operation of the borrower\u2019s business, repayment of such loans can be affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the local economy. Because we plan to continue to increase our originations of these loans, it may be necessary to increase the level of our allowance for loan losses because of the increased risk characteristics associated with these types of loans. Any such increase to our allowance for loan losses would adversely affect our earnings.\nWe have a significant concentration in commercial real estate loans. If our regulators were to curtail our commercial real estate lending activities, our earnings, dividend paying capacity and/or ability to repurchase shares could be adversely affected.\nIn 2006, the FDIC, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System issued joint guidance entitled \u201cConcentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices\u201d (the \u201cGuidance\u201d). The Guidance provides that a bank\u2019s commercial real estate lending exposure may receive increased supervisory scrutiny when total non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, including loans secured by multi-family property, non-owner occupied commercial real estate and construction and land loans, represent 300% or more of an institution\u2019s total risk-based capital and the outstanding balance of the commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased by 50% or more during the preceding 36 months. Our level of non-owner occupied commercial real estate equaled 394% of Bank total risk-based capital at June 30, 2019 and our commercial real estate loan portfolio increased by 79% during the preceding 36 months.\nWe may be adversely affected by recent changes in tax laws.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d), which was enacted in December 2017, is likely to have both positive and negative effects on our financial performance. For example, the legislation resulted in a reduction in our federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018, which will have a favorable impact on our earnings and capital generation abilities. However, the legislation also enacted limitations on certain deductions that will have an impact on the banking industry, borrowers and the market for single-family residential real estate.\nThese limitations include (1) a lower limit on the deductibility of mortgage interest on single-family residential mortgage loans, (2) the elimination of interest deductions for certain home equity loans, (3) a limitation on the deductibility of business interest expense, and (4) a limitation on the deductibility of property taxes and state and local income taxes.\nThe recent changes in the federal tax laws may have an adverse effect on the market for, and the valuation of, residential properties, and on the demand for such loans in the future, and could make it harder for borrowers to make their loan payments. In addition, these recent changes may also have a disproportionate effect on taxpayers in states with high residential home prices and high state and local taxes, like New Jersey and New York. If home ownership becomes less attractive, demand for mortgage loans could decrease. The value of the properties securing loans in our loan portfolio may be adversely impacted as a result of the changing economics of home ownership, which could require an increase in our provision for loan losses, which would reduce our profitability and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, legislation in New Jersey that was adopted in July 2018 has increased our state income tax liability and increased our overall tax expense. The legislation imposes a temporary surtax on corporations earning New Jersey allocated income in excess of $1 million of 2.5% for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2019, and of 1.5% for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021. The surtax will be discontinued for our tax year beginning on July 1, 2022. The new legislation also requires combined filing for certain members of an affiliated group for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2019, changing New Jersey's current status as a separate return state, and limits the deductibility of dividends received. These changes are not temporary. We do not expect there to be a material change to our income tax expense as a result of the combined filing requirement.\nChanges to LIBOR may adversely impact the value of, and the return on, our loans and investment securities which are indexed to LIBOR.\nOn July 27, 2017, the U.K Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the LIBOR administrator after 2021. The announcement also indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. Consequently, at this time, it is not possible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the LIBOR administrator or whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. Similarly, it is not possible to predict whether LIBOR will continue to be viewed as an acceptable benchmark for certain loans and liabilities including our subordinated notes, what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR or the effect of any such changes in views or alternatives on the values of the loans and liabilities, whose interest rates are tied to LIBOR.\nUncertainty as to the nature of such potential changes, alternative reference rates, the elimination or replacement of LIBOR, or other reforms may adversely affect the value of, and the return on our loans, and our investment securities.\nIncome from secondary mortgage market operations is volatile, and we may incur losses with respect to our secondary mortgage market operations that could negatively affect our earnings.\nA component of our business strategy is to sell a portion of residential mortgage loans originated into the secondary market, earning non-interest income in the form of gains on sale. For the year ended June 30, 2019, sale gains attributable to the sale of residential mortgage loans totaled $524,000 or approximately 3.9% of our non-interest income. When interest rates rise, the demand for mortgage loans tends to fall and may reduce the number of loans we can originate for sale. Weak or deteriorating economic conditions also tend to reduce loan demand. If the residential mortgage loan demand decreases or we are unable to sell such loans for an adequate profit, then our non-interest income will likely decline which would adversely affect our earnings.\nOur reliance on wholesale deposits could adversely affect our liquidity and operating results.\nAmong other sources of funds, we rely on wholesale deposits, including brokered deposits and non-brokered deposits acquired through listing services, to provide funds with which to make loans and provide for other liquidity needs. On June 30, 2019, brokered deposits totaled $235.8 million, or approximately 5.7% of total deposits. As of that same date, the outstanding balance of certificates of deposit acquired through listing services totaled $66.1 million or 1.6% of total deposits.\nGenerally wholesale deposits may not be as stable as deposits acquired through traditional retail channels. In the future, those depositors may not replace their deposits with us as they mature, or we may have to pay a higher rate of interest to keep those deposits or to replace them with other deposits or other sources of funds. Not being able to maintain or replace those deposits as they mature would adversely affect our liquidity. Paying higher deposit rates to maintain or replace brokered deposits would adversely affect our net interest margin and operating results.\nWe may be required to record impairment charges with respect to our investment securities portfolio.\nWe review our securities portfolio at the end of each quarter to determine whether the fair value is below the current carrying value. When the fair value of any of our investment securities has declined below its carrying value, we are required to assess whether the impairment is other than temporary, such assessment is completed internally, on a quarterly basis. If we conclude that the impairment is other than temporary, we are required to write down the value of that security. The credit-related portion of the impairment is recognized through earnings whereas the noncredit-related portion is generally recognized through other comprehensive income in the circumstances where the future sale of the security is unlikely.\nAt June 30, 2019, we had investment securities with fair values of approximately $1.30 billion on which we had approximately $4.0 million in gross unrealized losses and $14.0 million of gross unrealized gains. All unrealized losses on investment securities at June 30, 2019 represented temporary impairments of value. However, if changes in the expected cash flows of these securities and/or prolonged price declines result in our concluding in future periods that the impairment of these securities is other than temporary, we will be required to record an impairment charge against income equal to the credit-related impairment.\nOur investments in corporate and municipal debt securities, trust preferred and subordinated debt securities and collateralized loan obligations expose us to additional credit risks.\nThe composition and allocation of our investment portfolio has historically emphasized U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities and U.S. agency debentures. While such assets remain a significant component of our investment portfolio at June 30, 2019, prior enhancements to our investment policies, strategies and infrastructure have enabled us to diversify the composition and allocation of our securities portfolio. Such diversification has included investing in corporate debt and municipal obligations, trust preferred and subordinated debt securities issued by financial institutions and collateralized loan obligations. With the exception of collateralized loan obligations, these securities are generally backed only by the credit of their issuers while investments in collateralized loan obligations generally rely on the structural characteristics of an individual tranche within a larger investment vehicle to protect the investor from credit losses arising from borrowers defaulting on the underlying securitized loans.\nWhile we have invested primarily in investment grade securities, these securities are not backed by the federal government and expose us to a greater degree of credit risk than U.S. agency securities. Any decline in the credit quality of these securities exposes us to the risk that the market value of the securities could decrease which may require us to write down their value and could lead to a possible default in payment.\nWe hold certain intangible assets that could become impaired in the future. If these assets are considered to be either partially or fully impaired in the future, our earnings would decrease.\nAt June 30, 2019, we had approximately $216.1 million in intangible assets on our balance sheet comprising $210.9 million of goodwill and $5.2 million of core deposit intangibles. We are required to periodically test our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets for impairment. The impairment testing process considers a variety of factors, including the current market price of our common stock, the estimated net present value of our assets and liabilities, and information concerning the terminal valuation of similarly situated insured depository institutions. If an impairment determination is made in a future reporting period, our earnings and the book value of these intangible assets will be reduced by the amount of the impairment. If an impairment loss is recorded, it will have little or no impact on the tangible book value of our common stock or our regulatory capital levels, but recognition of such an impairment loss could significantly restrict Kearny Bank\u2019s ability to make dividend payments to Kearny Financial and therefore adversely impact our ability to pay dividends to stockholders.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in federal and state laws and regulations.\nThe financial services industry is extensively regulated. Federal and state banking regulations are designed primarily to protect the deposit insurance funds and consumers, not to benefit a company\u2019s shareholders. These regulations may sometimes impose significant limitations on operations. The significant federal and state banking regulations that affect us are described under the heading \u201cItem 1. Business-Regulation.\u201d These regulations, along with the currently existing tax, accounting, securities, insurance, and monetary laws, regulations, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations control the methods by which financial institutions conduct business, implement strategic initiatives and tax compliance, and govern financial reporting and disclosures. New proposals for legislation continue to be introduced in the U.S. Congress that could further alter the regulation of the bank and non-bank financial services industries and the manner in which companies within the industry conduct business.\nIn addition, federal and state regulatory agencies also frequently adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied. Future changes in federal policy and at regulatory agencies may occur over time through policy and personnel changes, which could lead to changes involving the level of oversight and focus on the financial services industry. These changes may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes to operations to comply and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA natural disaster could harm our business.\nNatural disasters can disrupt our operations, result in damage to our properties, reduce or destroy the value of the collateral for our loans and negatively affect the local economies in which we operate, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The occurrence of a natural disaster could result in one or more of the following: (i) an increase in loan delinquencies; (ii) an increase in problem assets and foreclosures; (iii) a decrease in the demand for our products and services; or (iv) a decrease in the value of the collateral for loans, especially real estate, in turn reducing customers\u2019 borrowing power, the value of assets associated with problem loans and collateral coverage.\nActs of terrorism and other external events could impact our ability to conduct business.\nFinancial institutions have been, and continue to be, targets of terrorist threats aimed at compromising operating and communication systems. Additionally, the metropolitan New York area and northern New Jersey remain central targets for potential acts of terrorism. Such events could cause significant damage, impact the stability of our facilities and result in additional expenses, impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, reduce the value of collateral securing repayment of our loans, and result in the loss of revenue. While we have established and regularly test disaster recovery procedures, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition.\nBecause the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions, we face significant operational risks.\nWe operate in diverse markets and rely on the ability of our employees and systems to process a high number of transactions. Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from our operations, including but not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside the Company, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements, and business continuation and disaster recovery. Insurance coverage may not be available for such losses, or where available, such losses may exceed insurance limits. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards, adverse business decisions or their implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity. In the event of a breakdown in the internal control system, improper operation of systems or improper employee actions, we could suffer financial loss, face regulatory action, and suffer damage to our reputation.\nOur risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risk and reducing the potential for significant losses.\nOur risk management framework is designed to effectively manage and mitigate risk while minimizing exposure to potential losses. We seek to identify, measure, monitor, report and control our exposure to risk, including strategic, market, liquidity, compliance and operational risks. While we use a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and mitigation techniques, these techniques are inherently limited because they cannot anticipate the existence or future development of currently unanticipated or unknown risks. Recent economic conditions and heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny of the financial services industry, among other developments, have increased our level of risk. Accordingly, we could suffer losses as a result of our failure to properly anticipate and manage these risks.\nWe could be adversely affected by failure in our internal controls.\nA failure in our internal controls could have a significant negative impact not only on our earnings, but also on the perception that customers, regulators and investors may have of us. We continue to devote a significant amount of effort, time and resources to continually strengthening our controls and ensuring compliance with complex accounting standards and banking regulations.\nThe inability to attract and retain key personnel could adversely affect our business.\nThe successful execution of our business strategy is partially dependent on our ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel. Failure to do so could adversely affect our strategy, customer relationships and internal operations.\nRisks associated with system failures, service interruptions or other performance exceptions could negatively affect our earnings.\nInformation technology systems are critical to our business. We use various technology systems to manage our customer relationships, general ledger, securities investments, deposits, and loans. We have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the effect of system failures, service interruptions or other performance exceptions, but such events may still occur or may not be adequately addressed if they do occur. In addition, performance failures or other exceptions of our customer-facing technologies could deter customers from using our products and services.\nIn addition, we outsource a majority of our data processing to certain third-party service providers. If these service providers encounter difficulties, or if we have difficulty communicating with them, our ability to timely and accurately process and account for transactions could be adversely affected.\nThe occurrence of any system failures, service interruptions or other performance exceptions could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business thereby subjecting us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or could expose us to litigation and possible financial liability. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks associated with cyber-security could negatively affect our earnings.\nThe financial services industry has experienced an increase in both the number and severity of reported cyber-attacks aimed at gaining unauthorized access to bank systems as a way to misappropriate assets and sensitive information, corrupt and destroy data, or cause operational disruptions.\nWe have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of security breaches, but such events may still occur or may not be adequately addressed if they do occur. Although we rely on security safeguards to secure our data, these safeguards may not fully protect our systems from compromises or breaches.\nWe also rely on the integrity and security of a variety of third party processors, payment, clearing and settlement systems, as well as the various participants involved in these systems, many of which have no direct relationship with us. Failure by these participants or their systems to protect our customers' transaction data may put us at risk for possible losses due to fraud or operational disruption.\nOur customers are also the target of cyber-attacks and identity theft. Large scale identity theft could result in customers' accounts being compromised and fraudulent activities being performed in their name. We have implemented certain safeguards against these types of activities but they may not fully protect us from fraudulent financial losses.\nThe occurrence of a breach of security involving our customers' information, regardless of its origin, could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business and subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, and could expose us to litigation and possible financial liability. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur inability to effectively deploy our excess capital may negatively affect return on equity and shareholder value.\nOur successful second step conversion and stock offering during fiscal 2015 resulted in a significant level of excess capital in relation to our overall asset size and risk profile. Our business plan calls for us to execute a variety of strategies to deploy this excess capital including, but not limited to, continued organic balance sheet growth and diversification, implementation of share repurchase plans and payment of regular cash dividends. Additionally, we will carefully consider acquisition opportunities to further deploy our excess capital when we expect such opportunities to significantly enhance long-term shareholder value. Our inability to effectively and timely deploy our excess capital through these strategies may constrain growth in earnings and return on equity and thereby diminish potential growth in shareholder value.\nOur inability to achieve profitability on new branches may negatively affect our earnings.\nWe have expanded our presence throughout our market area and we intend to pursue further expansion through de novo branching or the purchase of branches from other financial institutions. The profitability of our expansion strategy will depend on whether the income that we generate from the new branches will offset the increased expenses resulting from operating these branches. We expect that it may take a period of time before these branches can become profitable, especially in areas in which we do not have an established presence. During this period, the expense of operating these branches may negatively affect our net income.", "PERMNO": 90600, "SIC": 6036, "TIC": "KRNY"}
