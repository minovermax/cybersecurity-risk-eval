{"cik": "1089819", "company": "Cleco Corporate Holdings LLC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-27", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following risk factors could have a material adverse effect on results and cause results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, the Registrants.\nCleco Cajun Transaction\nThe success of the Cleco Cajun Transaction depends, in part, on Cleco\u2019s ability to realize anticipated benefits and conduct an effective integration process.\nOn February 4, 2019, Cleco acquired all of the membership interests of NRG South Central upon the closing of the Cleco Cajun Transaction. The success of the Cleco Cajun Transaction will depend, in part, on Cleco\u2019s ability to realize the expected benefits in the anticipated timeframe, including operating efficiencies, growth opportunities, cost savings and customer retention, from integrating Cleco\u2019s and NRG South Central\u2019s businesses, while at the same time continuing to provide consistent, high quality services. The integration process could be complex, costly and time consuming, including the diversion of significant management time and resources thereto, and may result in the following challenges, among others:\n\u2022\nunanticipated delays, disruptions, issues or costs in integrating operations, financial and accounting, information technology, communications and other systems;\n\u2022\npotential inconsistencies in procedures, practices, policies, controls, and standards;\n\u2022\npossible differences in compensation arrangements, management perspectives and corporate culture; and\n\u2022\nloss of or difficulties retaining valuable employees or third-party relationships.\nEven with the successful integration of the businesses, Cleco may not achieve the expected results or economic benefits. Any of the factors addressed above could decrease\nor delay the projected neutral or accretive effect of the Cleco Cajun Transaction. Failure to fully realize the anticipated benefits could adversely affect Cleco\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nFrom time to time, Cleco may continue to make acquisitions or divestitures of businesses and assets, form joint ventures or undertake restructurings. If Cleco is unable to make acquisitions or if those acquisitions do not perform as anticipated, Cleco\u2019s future growth may be adversely affected.\nHolding Company\nCleco Holdings is a holding company and its ability to meet its debt obligations is dependent on the cash generated by its subsidiaries.\nCleco Holdings is a holding company and conducts its operations primarily through its subsidiaries. Accordingly, Cleco Holdings\u2019 ability to meet its debt obligations is largely dependent upon the cash generated by these subsidiaries. Cleco Holdings\u2019 subsidiaries are separate and distinct entities and have no obligations to pay any amounts due on Cleco Holdings\u2019 debt or to make any funds available for such payment. In addition, Cleco Holdings\u2019 subsidiaries\u2019 ability to make dividend payments or other distributions to Cleco Holdings may be restricted by their obligations to holders of their outstanding securities and to other general business creditors. Substantially all of Cleco\u2019s consolidated assets are held by Cleco Power. Cleco Holdings\u2019 right to receive any assets of any subsidiary, and therefore the right of its creditors to participate in those assets, will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary\u2019s creditors, including trade creditors. In addition, even if Cleco Holdings were a creditor of any subsidiary, its rights as a creditor would be subordinated to any security interest in the assets of that subsidiary and any indebtedness of the subsidiary senior to that held by Cleco Holdings. Moreover, Cleco Power is subject to regulation by the LPSC, which may impose limits on the amount of dividends that Cleco Power may pay Cleco Holdings. The 2016 Merger Commitments also provide for limitations on the amount of\nCLECO\nCLECO POWER\n2018 FORM 10-K\ndistributions that may be paid from Cleco Power to Cleco Holdings, depending on Cleco Power\u2019s common equity ratio and its corporate credit/issuer ratings. As a result, Cleco Power may be prohibited from making distributions to Cleco Holdings.\nRegulatory Compliance\nCleco operates in a highly regulated environment and adverse regulatory decisions or changes in applicable regulations could have a material adverse effect on the Registrants\u2019 business or result in significant additional costs.\nCleco\u2019s business is subject to extensive federal, state, and local energy, environmental, and other laws and regulations. The LPSC regulates Cleco\u2019s retail operations and FERC regulates Cleco\u2019s wholesale operations. The construction, planning, and siting of Cleco\u2019s power plants and transmission lines are also subject to the jurisdiction of the LPSC and FERC. Additional regulatory authorities have jurisdiction over some of Cleco\u2019s operations and construction projects including the EPA, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the U.S. Department of Transportation, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, the Federal Communications Commission, the LDEQ, the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals, the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources, the Louisiana Department of Public Safety, the Louisiana Department of Agriculture, the Louisiana Bureau of Economic Analysis, regional water quality boards, and various local regulatory districts.\nShould Cleco be unsuccessful in obtaining necessary licenses or permits or should these regulatory authorities initiate any investigations or enforcement actions or impose penalties or disallowances on Cleco, Cleco\u2019s business could be adversely affected. Existing regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to Cleco or Cleco\u2019s facilities in a manner that may have a material adverse effect on the Registrants\u2019 business or result in significant additional costs.\nAs a result of the 2016 Merger, Cleco Holdings and Cleco Power made 2016 Merger Commitments to the LPSC including but not limited to the extension of Cleco Power\u2019s current FRP for an additional two years, maintaining employee headcount, salaries, and benefits for ten years, and a limitation from incurring additional long-term debt, excluding non-recourse debt, unless certain financial ratios are achieved.\nIn April 2016, the LPSC issued Docket No. R-34026 to investigate the double leveraging issues for all LPSC-jurisdictional utilities whereby double leveraging is utilized to fund a utility\u2019s capital structure, and to consider whether any costs associated with such double leveraging should be included in the rates paid by the utility\u2019s retail ratepayers. Cleco Power has intervened in this proceeding, along with other Louisiana utilities. In April 2016, the LPSC also issued Docket No. R-34029 to investigate the tax structure issues for all LPSC-jurisdictional utilities to consider whether only the state and federal taxes included in a utility\u2019s retail rate will be those that do not exceed the utility\u2019s share of the actual taxes paid to those federal and state taxing authorities. Cleco Power filed a motion to intervene in this proceeding along with other Louisiana utilities. In October 2016, Cleco received the first set\nof data requests from the LPSC Staff for each of the above mentioned dockets. Cleco has filed responses to the non-confidential requests and is waiting on the completion of a confidentiality agreement to respond to the confidential requests. Cleco is unable to determine if or when the completion of this confidentiality agreement will occur. If the LPSC were to disallow such costs incurred by the utility to be included in retail rates, such disallowance could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nCommodity Prices\nCleco Power and Cleco Cajun may be exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices and other factors.\nCleco Power\nCleco Power may enter into fuel cost hedge positions to mitigate the volatility in fuel costs passed through to its retail customers. As a transmission owner in the MISO market, Cleco Power receives Auction Revenue Rights, which can be converted to FTRs. FTRs provide a financial hedge to manage the risk of transmission congestion costs in the day-ahead energy market. Cleco Power may purchase additional FTRs to further hedge its residual congestion cost risk.\nWhen these positions close, actual gains or losses are deferred and included in the FAC in the month the physical contract settles. Recovery of any of these FAC costs is subject to, and may be disallowed as part of, a prudency review or a periodic fuel audit conducted by the LPSC.\nCleco Cajun\nCleco Cajun may be exposed to market price fluctuations due to generation and customer load uncertainty, unexpected plant outages, changes in fuel costs or changes in load driven by weather or other factors.\nCleco Cajun may also enter into commercial or hedging transactions that introduce locational basis exposure, transmission or transportation risks, counterparty credit risk, or do not perfectly match the price or volumetric exposure of hourly demand and prices.\nCleco Power and Cleco Cajun may not be adequately hedged against changes in commodity prices, which could materially affect Cleco Power and Cleco Cajun\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nCleco may enter into transactions to hedge portions of customer supply agreements, natural gas, solid fuel requirements (coal), and other commodities within established risk management guidelines to manage the financial exposure related to uncertainty in commodity prices. As part of this strategy, Cleco may utilize fixed and variable price forward physical purchase and sales contracts, FTRs, firm transportation for fuels, futures, financial swaps, and physical or financial option contracts traded bilaterally with counterparties, in the over-the-counter markets, or on exchanges.\nAdditionally, Cleco may be able to only cover a portion of the exposure of its assets and commodities exposed to market price volatility, and the coverage will vary over time. To the extent Cleco has unhedged exposure, fluctuating commodity prices can materially affect Cleco\u2019s results of operations and financial position.\nCLECO\nCLECO POWER\n2018 FORM 10-K\nCleco may guarantee the performance of a portion of the obligations relating to hedging and risk management activities. Reductions in Cleco or Cleco Power\u2019s credit quality or changes in the market prices of transaction related energy commodities could increase the cash (margining) or letter of credit collateral required to be posted in connection with hedging and risk management activities, which could materially affect Cleco or Cleco Power\u2019s liquidity and financial position.\nTransmission Constraints\nTransmission constraints could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nEnergy prices in the MISO market are based on LMP, which includes a component directly related to congestion on the transmission system. Pricing zones with greater transmission congestion may have a higher LMP. Physical transmission constraints present in the MISO market could increase energy costs within Cleco Power\u2019s pricing zones. Cleco Power purchases FTRs to mitigate transmission congestion price risks. However, insufficient FTR allocations or increased FTR costs due to negative congestion flows may result in an unexpected increase in energy costs to Cleco Power\u2019s customers. If a disallowance of additional fuel costs associated with congestion is ordered by the LPSC resulting in a refund to Cleco Power\u2019s customers, any such refund could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nLPSC Audits\nThe LPSC conducts fuel audits that could result in Cleco Power making substantial refunds of previously recorded revenue.\nGenerally, fuel and purchased power expenses are recovered through the LPSC-established FAC, that enables Cleco Power to pass on to its customers substantially all such charges. Recovery of FAC costs is subject to periodic fuel audits by the LPSC. The LPSC FAC General Order issued in November 1997, in Docket No. U-21497 provides that an audit will be performed at least every other year.\nCleco Power has FAC filings for 2018 and thereafter subject to audit. Management is unable to predict or give a reasonable estimate of the possible range of the disallowance, if any, related to these filings. If a disallowance of fuel costs is ordered, resulting in a refund to Cleco Power\u2019s customers, any such refund could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nThe LPSC conducts audits of environmental costs that could result in Cleco Power making substantial refunds of previously recorded revenue.\nIn 2009, the LPSC issued Docket No. U-29380 Subdocket A, which provides for an EAC to recover from customers certain costs of environmental compliance. The costs eligible for recovery are prudently incurred air emissions credits associated with complying with federal, state, and local air emission regulations that apply to the generation of electricity reduced by the sale of such allowances. Also eligible for recovery are variable emission mitigation costs, which are the costs of reagents such as ammonia and limestone that are a part of the fuel mix used to reduce air emissions, among other\nthings. Cleco Power began incurring additional environmental compliance expenses beginning in 2015 for reagents associated with compliance with MATS. These expenses are eligible for recovery through Cleco Power\u2019s EAC and subject to periodic review by the LPSC.\nCleco Power has EAC filings for 2016 and thereafter subject to audit. On May 22, 2018, Cleco Power received notice of an EAC audit from the LPSC for the period of January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2017, and Cleco Power has responded to several sets of data requests. The total amount of environmental expense included in the audit is $30.7 million. Management is unable to predict or give a reasonable estimate of the possible range of the disallowance, if any, related to these filings. If a disallowance of environmental costs is ordered resulting in a refund to Cleco Power\u2019s customers, any such refund could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nFERC Audit\nFERC conducts audits that could result in Cleco Power making refunds of previously recorded revenue.\nGenerally, Cleco Power records wholesale transmission revenue through Attachment O of the MISO tariff and certain grandfathered agreements. These formulas are based on inputs from Cleco Power\u2019s FERC Form 1. These rates and regulatory filings are subject to periodic audits by FERC. On March 13, 2018, the Division of Audits and Accounting within the Office of Enforcement of FERC initiated an audit of Cleco Power for the period of January 1, 2014, to the present. Cleco has responded to several sets of data requests. Management is unable to predict or give a reasonable estimate of the possible range of the refund, if any, related to this audit. Any such refund could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nHedging and Risk Management Activities\nCleco Power and Cleco Cajun are exposed to the risk that counterparties may not meet their obligations, which may materially affect Cleco Power and Cleco Cajun\u2019s operating and financial performance.\nThe supply, commercial, and hedging transaction activities of Cleco Power and Cleco Cajun can be exposed to the risk that counterparties may not perform on their physical or financial obligations. Currently, some master agreements contain provisions that require the counterparties to provide credit support to secure all or part of their obligations to Cleco, or specifically to Cleco Power or Cleco Cajun. If the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, Cleco may enforce and recover the proceeds from the credit support provided and acquire alternative hedging arrangements; however, credit support may not always be adequate to cover the related obligations. In such event, Cleco may incur losses in excess of amounts, if any, already paid to the counterparties. In addition, the credit commitments of Cleco\u2019s lenders under its bank facilities may not be honored for a variety of reasons, including unexpected periods of financial distress affecting such lenders, which could materially affect the adequacy of its liquidity sources.\nCLECO\nCLECO POWER\n2018 FORM 10-K\nThe accounting for Cleco\u2019s hedging activities may increase the volatility in the Registrants\u2019 quarterly and annual financial results.\nCleco engages in transactions to economically hedge forward commodity market price risk exposure utilizing both physical and financial commodity purchases and sales commitments. Some of these contracts are accounted for as derivatives, which requires Cleco to record the fair value of the commitment on the balance sheet with changes in the fair value of all derivatives reflected within current period earnings. As a result, Cleco is unable to accurately predict the effect that its risk management decisions may have on quarterly and annual financial results, which could materially adversely affect the results of operations of the Registrants.\nGlobal Economic Environment and Uncertainty; Access to Capital\nAdverse capital market performance could result in reductions in the fair value of benefit plan assets and increase the Registrant\u2019s liabilities related to such plans. Sustained declines in the fair value of the plan\u2019s assets or sustained increases in plan liabilities could result in significant increases in funding requirements, which could adversely affect the Registrant\u2019s liquidity and results of operations.\nPerformance of the capital markets affects the value of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under Cleco\u2019s defined benefit pension plan. Sustained adverse market performance could result in lower rates of return for these assets than projected by Cleco and could increase Cleco\u2019s funding requirements related to the pension plan. Additionally, changes in interest rates affect the present value of Cleco\u2019s liabilities under the pension plan. Adverse changes in assumptions or adverse actual events could cause additional minimum contributions.\nInflation\nAnnual inflation rates, as measured by the U.S. Consumer Price Index, have averaged 2% during the three years ended December 31, 2018. Under established regulatory practice, historical costs have traditionally formed the basis for recovery from customers. As a result, Cleco Power\u2019s future cash flows designed to provide recovery of historical plant costs may not be adequate to replace property, plant, and equipment in future years.\nDisruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect the Registrants\u2019 cost of capital and ability to meet liquidity needs or access capital to operate and grow the business.\nThe Registrants\u2019 business is capital intensive and dependent upon the Registrants\u2019 respective abilities to access capital at reasonable rates and other terms. The Registrants\u2019 liquidity needs could significantly increase in the event of a hurricane or other weather-related or unforeseen disaster or when there are spikes in the price for natural gas and other commodities. The occurrence of one or more contingencies, including a delay in regulatory recovery of fuel, purchased power, or storm restoration costs; higher than expected required pension contributions; an acceleration of payments or decreased credit lines; less cash flow from operations than expected; or other unexpected events, could cause the financing needs of the Registrants to increase materially.\nEvents beyond the Registrants\u2019 control, such as political uncertainty in the U.S. (including the ongoing debates related to the U.S. federal government budget and debt ceiling), volatility and disruption in global capital and credit markets, may create uncertainty that could increase their cost of capital\nor impair their ability to access the capital markets, including the ability to draw on their respective bank credit facilities. The Registrants are unable to predict the degree of success they will have in renewing or replacing their respective credit facilities as they come up for renewal. Moreover, the size, terms, and covenants of any new credit facilities may not be comparable to, and may be more restrictive than, existing facilities. If the Registrants are unable to access the credit and capital markets on terms that are reasonable, they may have to delay raising capital, issue shorter-term securities, and/or bear an unfavorable cost of capital, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Registrants\u2019 ability to fund capital expenditures or to service debt, or on the Registrants\u2019 flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions.\nFuture Electricity Sales\nCleco Power\u2019s future electricity sales and corresponding base revenue and cash flows could be adversely affected by adverse macroeconomic conditions.\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions resulting in low economic growth can negatively impact the businesses of Cleco Power\u2019s residential, industrial, and commercial customers resulting in decreased power consumption, which causes a corresponding decrease in base revenue. Reduced production or the shutdown of any of these customers\u2019 facilities could substantially reduce Cleco Power\u2019s base revenue.\nEnergy conservation, energy efficiency efforts, and other factors that reduce energy demand could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nRegulatory and legislative bodies have proposed or introduced requirements and incentives to reduce peak energy consumption. Conservation and energy efficiency programs are designed to reduce energy demand. Future electricity sales could be impacted by customers switching to alternative sources of energy, such as solar and wind, on-site power generation, and retail customers purchasing less electricity due to increased conservation efforts or expanded energy efficiency measures. Declining usage could result in an under-recovery of fixed costs at Cleco Power\u2019s rate regulated business. An increase in energy conservation, energy efficiency efforts, and other efforts that reduce energy demand could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nCleco Power\u2019s Generation, Transmission, and Distribution Facilities\nCleco Power\u2019s generation facilities are susceptible to unplanned outages, significant maintenance requirements, and interruption of fuel deliveries.\nThe operation of power generation facilities involves many risks, including breakdown or failure of equipment, fuel supply interruption, and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency. Approximately 25% of Cleco Power\u2019s net capacity was constructed before 1980. Aging equipment, even if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices, may require significant expenditures to operate at peak efficiency, or to comply with environmental permits. Newer equipment can also be subject to unexpected failures. Accordingly, Cleco Power may incur more frequent unplanned\nCLECO\nCLECO POWER\n2018 FORM 10-K\noutages, higher than anticipated operating and maintenance expenditures, higher replacement costs of purchased power, increased fuel costs, MISO related costs, and the loss of potential revenue related to competitive opportunities. The costs of such repairs, maintenance, and purchased power may not be fully recoverable in rates and could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nCleco Power\u2019s generating facilities are fueled primarily by coal, natural gas, petroleum coke, and lignite. The deliverability of these fuel sources may be constrained due to such factors as higher demand, decreased regional supply, production shortages, weather-related disturbances, railroad constraints, waterway levels, labor strikes, or lack of transportation capacity. If suppliers are unable to deliver the contracted volume of fuel and associated inventories are depleted, Cleco Power may be unable to operate generating units which may cause Cleco Power to operate at higher overall energy costs, which would increase the cost to customers. Fuel and MISO-procured/settled energy expenses, which are recovered from customers through the FAC, are subject to refund until either a prudency review or a periodic fuel audit is conducted by the LPSC.\nCompetition for access to other natural resources, particularly oil and natural gas, could negatively impact Cleco Power\u2019s ability to access its lignite reserves. Placement of drilling rigs and pipelines for developing oil and gas reserves can preclude access to lignite in the same areas. Additionally, Cleco Power could be indirectly liable for the impacts of other companies\u2019 activities on lands that have been mined and reclaimed by Cleco Power. Access to lignite reserves or the liability for impacts on reclaimed lands may not be recoverable in rates and could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nThe construction of, and capital improvements to, power generation and transmission and distribution facilities involve substantial risks. Should construction or capital improvement efforts be significantly more expensive than planned, the financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity of Cleco Power could be materially affected.\nCleco Power\u2019s ability to complete construction of capital improvements to power generation and transmission and distribution facilities in a timely manner and within budget is contingent upon many variables and subject to substantial risks. These variables include engineering and project execution risk and escalating costs for materials, labor, and environmental compliance. Delays in obtaining permits, shortages in materials and qualified labor, suppliers and contractors not performing as set forth under their contracts, changes in the scope and timing of projects, inaccurate cost estimates, the inability to raise capital on favorable terms, changes in commodity prices affecting revenue, fuel or material costs, changes in the economy, changes in laws or regulations, including environmental compliance requirements, and other events beyond the control of Cleco Power may materially affect the schedule and cost of these projects. If these projects are significantly delayed or become subject to cost overruns or cancellation, Cleco Power could incur additional costs including termination payments, face increased risk of potential write-off of the investment in the project, or may not be able to recover such costs in rates. Furthermore, failure to maintain various levels of generating\nunit availability or transmission and distribution reliability may result in various disallowances of Cleco Power\u2019s investments.\nCleco Credit Ratings\nA downgrade in Cleco Holdings\u2019 or Cleco Power\u2019s credit ratings could result in an increase in their respective borrowing costs, a reduced pool of potential investors and funding sources, and a restriction on Cleco Power making distributions to Cleco Holdings.\nNeither Cleco Holdings nor Cleco Power can assure that its current debt ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of its debt ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. If S&P, Moody\u2019s, or Fitch were to downgrade Cleco Holdings\u2019 or Cleco Power\u2019s long-term ratings, particularly below investment grade, the value of their debt securities would be adversely affected. Downgrades of either Cleco Holdings\u2019 or Cleco Power\u2019s credit ratings could result in additional fees and higher interest rates for borrowings under their respective credit facilities. In addition, Cleco Holdings or Cleco Power, as the case may be, would likely be required to pay higher interest rates in future debt financings, may be subject to more onerous debt covenants, and their pool of potential investors and funding sources could decrease. In addition, the 2016 Merger Commitments provide for limitations on the amount of distributions that may be paid from Cleco Power to Cleco Holdings, depending on Cleco Power\u2019s common equity ratio and its corporate credit/issuer ratings. As a result, Cleco Power may be prohibited from making distributions to Cleco Holdings in the event of a ratings downgrade.\nMISO\nMISO market operations could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, generation revenues, energy supply costs, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nCleco is a member of the MISO market region referred to as \u201cMISO South,\u201d which encompasses parts of Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. Dispatch of generation resources and generation volumes to the market is determined by MISO. Costs in the MISO South region are heavily influenced by commodity fuel prices, transmission congestion, dispatch of the generating assets owned not only by Cleco, but by all market participants in the MISO South region, and the overall demand and generation availability in the region.\nMISO evaluates forced outage rates to assess generating unit capacity for planning reserve margins. If Cleco is subject to a significant amount of forced outages, Cleco may not possess sufficient planning reserves to serve its needs and could be forced to purchase capacity from the MISO resource adequacy auction. For Cleco Power, the costs of such capacity may not be recoverable in its rates and could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. Using MISO\u2019s unforced capacity method for determining generating unit capacity, Cleco Power\u2019s fleet provided for 323 MW of capacity in excess of its peak, coincident to MISO\u2019s peak, in 2018.\nCLECO\nCLECO POWER\n2018 FORM 10-K\nTechnology and Terrorism Threats\nThe operational and information technology systems on which Cleco relies to conduct its business and serve customers could fail to function properly due to technological problems, cyber attacks, physical attacks on Cleco\u2019s assets, acts of terrorism, severe weather, solar events, electromagnetic events, natural disasters, the age and condition of information technology assets, human error, or other reasons that could disrupt Cleco\u2019s operations and cause Cleco to incur unanticipated losses and expense.\nThe operation of Cleco\u2019s extensive electrical systems relies on evolving operational and information technology systems and network infrastructures that are becoming extremely complex as new technologies and systems are implemented to more safely and reliably deliver electric services. Cleco\u2019s business is highly dependent on its ability to process and monitor, on a real-time daily basis, a large number of tasks and transactions, many of which are highly complex. The failure of Cleco\u2019s operational and information technology systems and networks due to a physical or cyber attack, or other event would significantly disrupt operations; cause harm to the public or employees; result in outages or reduced generating output; result in damage to Cleco\u2019s assets or operations, or those of third parties; and subject Cleco to claims by customers or third parties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nCleco\u2019s systems, including its financial information, operational systems, advanced metering, and billing systems, require constant maintenance, monitoring, security patches, modification or configuration of systems, and update and upgrade of systems, which can be costly and increase the risk of errors and malfunction. Any disruptions or deficiencies in existing systems, or disruptions, delays, or deficiencies in the modification or implementation of new systems, could result in increased costs, the inability to track or collect revenues and the diversion of management\u2019s and employees\u2019 attention and resources, and could adversely affect the effectiveness of Cleco\u2019s control environment, and/or its ability to accurately or timely file required regulatory reports.\nDespite implementation of security and mitigation measures, all of Cleco\u2019s technology systems and those of Cleco\u2019s vendors are vulnerable to inoperability or impaired operations or failures due to cyber or physical attacks on the facilities and equipment needed to operate the technology systems, viruses, human errors, acts of war or terrorism, and other events. If Cleco\u2019s or its vendor\u2019s information technology systems or network infrastructure were to fail, Cleco might be unable to fulfill critical business functions and serve its customers, which could have a material adverse effect on the financial conditions, results of operations, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nIn addition, in the ordinary course of its business, Cleco collects and retains sensitive information including personal identification information about customers and employees, customer energy usage, and other confidential information. The theft, damage, or improper disclosure of sensitive electronic data could subject Cleco to both penalties for violation of applicable privacy laws and claims from third parties, or harm Cleco\u2019s reputation. In addition, new laws and regulations governing data privacy and the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information pose increasingly complex compliance challenges and potentially elevate costs,\nand any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in significant penalties and legal liability.\nTaxes\nChanges in taxation as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nThe Registrants make judgments regarding the utilization of existing income tax credits and the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and results of operations to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities. Tax obligations include income, franchise, real estate, sales and use, and employment-related taxes. These judgments may include reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken. Changes in federal, state, or local tax laws, adverse tax audit results, or adverse tax rulings on positions taken by the Registrants could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nChanges in taxation due to uncertain effects of the TCJA could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nThe budget reconciliation act commonly referred to as the TCJA was signed into law on December 22, 2017. Proposed rulemakings issued in 2018 by the IRS subsequent to the TCJA could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial conditions, or cash flows of the Registrants. The Registrants continue to assess the regulatory treatment of the TCJA, which could also have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nReliability and Infrastructure Protection Standards Compliance\nCleco is subject to mandatory reliability and critical infrastructure protection standards. Fines and civil penalties are imposed on those who fail to comply with these standards.\nNERC serves as the ERO with authority to establish and enforce mandatory reliability and infrastructure protection standards, subject to FERC approval, for users of the nation\u2019s transmission system. FERC enforces compliance with these standards. New standards are being developed and existing standards are continuously being modified.\nAs these standards continue to be adopted and modified, they may impose additional compliance requirements on Cleco Power, which may result in increased capital expenditures and operating expenses. Failure to comply with these standards can result in the imposition of material fines and civil penalties. Furthermore, failure to maintain various levels of generating unit availability or transmission and distribution reliability may result in various disallowances of Cleco Power\u2019s investments.\nThe SERC RE conducts a NERC Reliability Standards audit and a NERC Critical Infrastructure Protection audit every three years. Cleco Power\u2019s next NERC Reliability Standards audit is scheduled to begin in October 2019 and the next NERC Critical Infrastructure Protection audit is scheduled to begin in 2020. Management is unable to predict the outcome of any future audits or whether any findings will have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nCLECO\nCLECO POWER\n2018 FORM 10-K\nEnvironmental Compliance\nCleco\u2019s costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations are significant. The costs of compliance with new environmental laws and regulations, as well as the incurrence of incremental environmental liabilities, could be significant to the Registrants.\nCleco is subject to extensive environmental oversight by federal, state, and local authorities and is required to comply with numerous environmental laws and regulations related to air quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources, and health and safety. Cleco also is required to obtain and comply with numerous governmental permits in operating its facilities. Existing environmental laws, regulations, and permits could be revised or reinterpreted, and new laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to Cleco. For example, the EPA has issued the CPP to reduce CO2 emissions from existing EGUs by 32% from 2005 levels of CO2 emissions; however, on February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court issued orders staying implementation of the CPP pending resolution of challenges to the rule. On October 16, 2017, following a review as directed by the President, the EPA published a proposed rule to repeal the CPP. Whether the EPA will finalize its proposed rule to repeal the CPP remains uncertain; however, the EPA has proposed a draft rule called the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule to replace the CPP. These proposed actions by the EPA could also be subject to future legal challenges. As a result, there is currently no regulation in force and the future regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from existing EGUs is uncertain. Changes under the stayed CPP would have environmental regulations governing power plant emissions effective beginning 2022, with final emission goals required by 2030, and, if implemented, could render some of Cleco\u2019s EGUs uneconomical to maintain or operate and could prompt early retirement of certain generation units. Any legal obligation that would require Cleco to substantially reduce its emissions beyond present levels could require extensive mitigation efforts and could raise uncertainty about the future viability of some fossil fuels as fuel for new and existing electric generating facilities. Cleco will evaluate potential solutions to comply with such regulations and monitor rulemaking and any legal matters impacting the proposed regulations. Cleco may incur significant capital expenditures or additional operating costs to comply with such revisions, reinterpretations, and new requirements. If Cleco were to fail to comply, it could be subject to civil or criminal liabilities and fines or may be forced to shut down or reduce production from its facilities. Cleco cannot predict the timing or the outcome of pending or future legislative and rulemaking proposals.\nCleco Power may request from its customers recovery of its costs to comply with new environmental laws and regulations. If the LPSC were to deny Cleco Power\u2019s request to recover all or part of its environmental compliance costs, there could be a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nCleco Power\u2019s Rates\nThe LPSC and FERC regulate the retail rates and wholesale transmission tariffs, respectively, that Cleco Power can charge its customers.\nCleco Power\u2019s ongoing financial viability depends on its ability to recover its costs in a timely manner from its LPSC-\njurisdictional customers through LPSC-approved rates and its ability to recover its FERC-authorized revenue requirements from its FERC-jurisdictional wholesale transmission customers. Cleco Power\u2019s financial viability also depends on its ability to recover in rates an adequate return on capital, including long-term debt and equity. If Cleco Power is unable to recover any material amount of its costs in rates in a timely manner or recover an adequate return on capital, the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants could be materially adversely affected.\nCleco Power\u2019s revenues and earnings are substantially affected by regulatory proceedings known as rate cases or, in some cases, a request for extension of an FRP. During those cases, the LPSC determines Cleco Power\u2019s rate base, depreciation rates, operation and maintenance costs, and administrative and general costs that Cleco Power may recover from its retail customers through its rates. In some instances, the outcome of a rate case or request for extension of an FRP may impact wholesale decisions of Cleco Power. These proceedings may examine, among other things, the prudence of Cleco Power\u2019s operation and maintenance practices, level of subject expenditures, allowed rates of return, and previously incurred capital expenditures. The LPSC has the authority to disallow costs found not to have been prudently incurred. Rate cases generally have timelines of approximately one year, and decisions are typically subject to appeal, potentially leading to additional uncertainty. The transmission tariffs of Cleco Power are regulated by FERC with its own regulatory proceedings. Both the LPSC and FERC regulatory proceedings can involve multiple parties, including governmental bodies and officials, consumer advocacy groups, and various consumers of energy, all of whom have differing concerns but who have the common objective of limiting rate increases or reducing rates.\nTransmission rates that MISO transmission owners may collect are regulated by FERC. Two complaints were filed with FERC seeking to reduce the ROE component of the transmission rates that MISO transmission owners, including Cleco, may collect under the MISO tariff. There is one complaint currently open. Any reduction to the ROE component of the transmission rates could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nRetail Electric Service\nCleco Power\u2019s retail electric rates and business practices are regulated by the LPSC and reviews may result in refunds to customers.\nCleco Power\u2019s retail rates for residential, commercial, and industrial customers and other retail sales are regulated by the LPSC, which conducts an annual review of Cleco Power\u2019s earnings and regulatory ROE. Cleco Power could be required to make a substantial refund of previously recorded revenue as a result of the LPSC review and such refund could result in a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nCLECO\nCLECO POWER\n2018 FORM 10-K\nWholesale Electric Service\nCleco Power\u2019s business practices are regulated by FERC, and its wholesale rates are subject to FERC\u2019s triennial market power analysis. Cleco could lose the right to sell wholesale generation at market-based rates.\nFERC conducts a review of Cleco Power\u2019s generation market power every three years in addition to each time generation capacity changes. Cleco\u2019s next triennial market power analysis is expected to be filed in 2020. In the future, if FERC determines Cleco Power possesses generation market power in excess of certain thresholds, Cleco Power could lose the right to sell wholesale generation at market-based rates, which could result in a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nWeather Sensitivity\nThe operating results of Cleco Power are affected by weather conditions and may fluctuate on a seasonal basis.\nWeather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity, particularly with respect to residential customers. In Cleco Power\u2019s service territory, demand for power typically peaks during the hot summer months. As a result, Cleco Power\u2019s financial results may fluctuate on a seasonal basis. In addition, Cleco Power has sold less power and, consequently, earned less income when weather conditions were milder. Unusually mild weather in the future could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nSevere weather, including hurricanes and winter storms, can affect transportation of fuel to plant sites and can be destructive, causing outages and property damage that can potentially result in additional expenses, lower revenue, and additional capital restoration costs. Extreme drought conditions can impact the availability of cooling water to support the operations of generating plants, which can also result in additional expenses and lower revenue.\nThe physical risks associated with climate changes could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nIf climate changes occur that result in warmer temperatures in Cleco\u2019s service territories, it could result in one or more physical risks, such as an increase in sea level, wind and storm surge damages, wetland and barrier island erosion, risks of flooding, and changes in weather conditions, such as changes in temperature and precipitation patterns, and potential increased impacts of extreme weather conditions or storms, or could affect the Registrants\u2019 operations. The Registrants\u2019 assets are in and serve communities that are at risk from sea level rise, changes in weather conditions, storms, and loss of the protection offered by coastal wetlands. A significant portion of the nation\u2019s oil and gas infrastructure is located in these areas and is susceptible to storm damage that could be aggravated by wetland and barrier island erosion, which could give rise to fuel supply interruptions and price spikes.\nThese and other physical changes could result in changes in customer demand, increased costs associated with repairing and maintaining generating facilities and transmission and distribution systems, resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs (and potential increased\nfinancing needs), limits on Cleco Power\u2019s ability to meet peak customer demand, increased regulatory oversight, and lower customer satisfaction. Also, to the extent that climate change would adversely impact the economic health of a region or result in energy conservation or demand side management programs, it may adversely impact customer demand and revenues. Such physical or operational risks could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nLitigation\nCleco is subject to litigation related to the 2016 Merger.\nIn connection with the 2016 Merger, four actions were filed in the Ninth Judicial District Court for Rapides Parish, Louisiana and three actions were filed in the Civil District Court for Orleans Parish, Louisiana. One of the actions filed in Rapides Parish has been dismissed. The remaining three actions in Rapides Parish have been consolidated. The three actions in Orleans Parish have been transferred to Rapides Parish and consolidated with the other litigation in Rapides Parish. The actions were filed against Cleco Corporation and, among others, Cleco Partners, Merger Sub, and members of the Board of Directors of Cleco Corporation. The petitions generally allege, among other things, that the members of Cleco Corporation\u2019s Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duties by, among other things, conducting an allegedly inadequate sale process, agreeing to the 2016 Merger at a price that allegedly undervalues Cleco, and failing to disclose material information about the 2016 Merger. The petitions also allege that Cleco Partners, Cleco, and Merger Sub and, in some cases, certain of the investors in Cleco Partners, either aided and abetted or entered into a civil conspiracy to advance those supposed breaches of duty. The petitions seek various remedies, including monetary damages, which includes attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses. In September 2016, the District Court granted the exceptions filed by Cleco and dismissed all claims asserted by the former shareholders. The plaintiffs appealed the District Court\u2019s ruling and on December 13, 2017, the Third Circuit Court of Appeal issued an order reversing and remanding the case back to the District Court for further proceedings. On January 12, 2018, Cleco filed a writ with the Louisiana Supreme Court seeking review of the Third Circuit Court of Appeal\u2019s decision. On March 2, 2018, the Louisiana Supreme Court denied the writ. Cleco filed writs of exception of res judicata and no cause of action in the District Court seeking dismissal of the case. On January 14, 2019, the District Court denied the writs.\nIt is possible that additional claims beyond those that have already been filed will be brought by the current plaintiffs or by others in an effort to seek monetary relief from Cleco. Cleco is not able to predict the outcome of these actions, or others, nor can Cleco predict the amount of time and expense that will be required to resolve the actions. In addition, the cost to Cleco of defending the actions, even if resolved in Cleco\u2019s favor, could be substantial. Such actions could also divert the attention of Cleco\u2019s management and resources from day-to-day operations.\nThe outcome of legal proceedings cannot be predicted. An adverse finding could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nThe Registrants are party to various litigation matters arising out of the ordinary operations of their business. The ultimate\nCLECO\nCLECO POWER\n2018 FORM 10-K\noutcome of these matters cannot presently be determined, nor, in many cases, can the liability that could potentially result from a negative outcome in each case presently be reasonably estimated. The liability that the Registrants may ultimately incur with respect to any of these cases in the event of a negative outcome may be in excess of amounts currently reserved and insured against with respect to such matters and, as a result, these matters may have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nGovernment Reform\nChanges in environmental, fiscal, and tax policies could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nThe current Administration has called for substantial changes to environmental, fiscal, and tax policies. It is possible that these changes could adversely affect Cleco\u2019s business. Until changes are enacted, management is unable to determine the impact of the changes on the Registrants\u2019 business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.\nWorkforce\nFailure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nCertain events, such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, matching of skill set or complement to future needs, or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs. The challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge, and a lengthy time period associated with skill development. In this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs, and safety costs, may rise. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the Registrants\u2019 businesses. If the Registrants are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants could be materially adversely affected.\nAlternative Generation Technology\nChanges in technology may have a material adverse effect on the value of Cleco Power\u2019s generating facilities.\nA basic premise of Cleco\u2019s business is that generating electricity at central power plants achieves economies of scale and produces electricity at a relatively low price. There are alternative technologies to produce electricity, most notably wind turbines, photovoltaic cells, and other solar generated power. Many companies and organizations conduct research and development activities to seek improvements in alternative technologies. As new technologies are developed and become available, the quantity and pattern of electricity purchased by customers could decline, with a corresponding decline in revenues derived by generating assets. As a result, the value of Cleco Power\u2019s generating facilities could be reduced.\nInsurance\nCleco\u2019s insurance coverage may not be sufficient.\nCleco currently has property, casualty, cyber security and liability insurance policies in place to protect its employees, directors, and assets in amounts that it considers appropriate. Such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles. Insurance coverage may not be available in the future at current costs, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of, or any damage to, any of Cleco\u2019s facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage without a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nLike other utilities that serve coastal regions, Cleco Power does not have insurance covering its transmission and distribution system, other than substations, because it believes such insurance to be cost prohibitive. In the future, Cleco Power may not be able to recover the costs incurred in restoring transmission and distribution properties following hurricanes or other natural disasters through issuance of storm recovery bonds or a change in Cleco Power\u2019s regulated rates or otherwise, or any such recovery may not be timely granted. Therefore, Cleco Power may not be able to restore any loss of, or damage to, any of its transmission and distribution properties without a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nCleco Power LLC\u2019s Unsecured and Unsubordinated Obligations\nCleco Power LLC\u2019s unsecured and unsubordinated obligations, including, without limitation, its senior notes, will be effectively subordinated to any secured debt of Cleco Power LLC, certain unsecured debt of Cleco Power LLC, and any preferred equity of any of Cleco Power LLC\u2019s subsidiaries.\nSome of Cleco Power LLC\u2019s senior notes and its obligations under various loan agreements and refunding agreements with the Rapides Finance Authority, the Louisiana Public Facilities Authority, and other issuers of tax-exempt bonds for the benefit of Cleco Power LLC are unsecured and rank equally with all of Cleco Power LLC\u2019s existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. As of December 31, 2018, Cleco Power LLC had an aggregate of $1.36 billion of unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness net of debt discount and debt expense. The unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of Cleco Power LLC will be effectively subordinated to, and thus have a junior position to, any secured debt that Cleco Power LLC may have outstanding from time to time (including any mortgage bonds) with respect to the assets securing such debt. Certain agreements entered into by Cleco Power LLC with other lenders that are unsecured provide that if Cleco Power LLC issues secured debt, Cleco Power LLC is obligated to grant these lenders the same security interest in certain assets of Cleco Power LLC. If such a security interest were to arise, it would further subordinate Cleco Power LLC\u2019s unsecured and unsubordinated obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2018, Cleco Power LLC had no secured indebtedness outstanding. Cleco Power LLC may issue mortgage bonds in the future under any future Indenture of Mortgage, and holders of mortgage bonds would have a prior claim on certain Cleco Power LLC material assets upon dissolution, winding up, liquidation, or reorganization.\nCLECO\nCLECO POWER\n2018 FORM 10-K\nAdditionally, Cleco Power LLC\u2019s ability (and the ability of Cleco Power LLC\u2019s creditors, including holders of its senior notes) to participate in the assets of Cleco Power LLC\u2019s subsidiary, Cleco Katrina/Rita, is subject to the prior claims of the\nsubsidiary\u2019s creditors. As of December 31, 2018, Cleco Katrina/Rita had $31.3 million of indebtedness outstanding, net of debt discount and debt expense.", "PERMNO": 64557, "SIC": 4911, "TIC": "CNL"}
