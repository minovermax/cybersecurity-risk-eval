{"cik": "1160308", "company": "Mast Therapeutics, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-06", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nInvestment in our securities involves a high degree of risk and uncertainty. Our business, operating results, growth prospects and financial condition are subject to various risks, many of which are not exclusively within our control, that may cause actual performance to differ materially from historical or projected future performance. We urge investors to consider carefully the risks described below, together with all of the information in this report and our other public filings, before making investment decisions regarding our securities. Each of these risk factors, as well as additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial, could adversely affect our business, operating results, growth prospects or financial condition, as well as the trading price of our common stock, in which case you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Proposed Merger with Savara\nThe exchange ratio is not adjustable based on the market price of our common stock so the merger consideration at the closing may have a greater or lesser value than at the time we signed the merger agreement.\nOur merger agreement with Savara has set the exchange ratio for the Savara common stock, and the exchange ratio is only adjustable upward or downward under certain circumstances. Any changes in the market price of our common stock before the completion of the merger will not affect the number of shares Savara securityholders will be entitled to receive pursuant to the merger agreement. Therefore, if before the completion of the merger the market price of our common stock declines from the market price on the date of the merger agreement, then Savara securityholders could receive merger consideration with substantially lower value. Similarly, if before the completion of the merger the market price of our common stock increases from the market price on the date of the merger agreement, then Savara securityholders could receive merger consideration with substantially more value for their shares of Savara capital stock than the parties had negotiated for in the establishment of the exchange ratio. Because the exchange ratio does not adjust as a result of changes in the value of our common stock, for each one percentage point that the market value of our common stock rises or declines, there is a corresponding one percentage point rise or decline, respectively, in the value of the total merger consideration issued to Savara securityholders.\nFailure to complete the merger may result in Mast and Savara paying a termination fee or expenses to the other party and could harm the common stock price of Mast and future business and operations of each company.\nIf the merger is not completed, Mast and Savara are subject to the following risks:\n\u2022\nif the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, we will be required to pay Savara a termination fee of $1.8 million;\n\u2022\nif the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, Savara will be required to pay us a termination fee of $2.5 million;\n\u2022\nthe price of our stock may decline and remain volatile, which may result in the delisting of our common stock from the NYSE MKT; and\n\u2022\ncosts related to the merger, such as legal and accounting fees, and with respect to Mast, tail insurance premiums, which Mast and Savara estimate will total approximately $2.6 million and $1.5 million, respectively, some of which must be paid even if the merger is not completed.\nIn addition, if the merger agreement is terminated and our board of directors determines to seek another business combination, there can be no assurance that we will be able to find a partner willing to provide equivalent or more attractive strategic alternative than the proposed merger with Savara.\nIf the conditions to the merger are not met, the merger may not occur.\nEven if the merger is approved by our stockholders and the stockholders of Savara, specified conditions must be satisfied or waived to complete the merger. Including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\ncertain representations and warranties made by each party to the merger agreement must be true and correct, with the same force and effect as if made on and as of the closing date of the merger;\n\u2022\nthere must not have been any change, occurrence or circumstance in the business, results of operations or financial condition of the parties that would prevent a party from consummating the merger or has had, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the party\u2019s business, financial condition, operations, or result of operations;\n\u2022\nthe shares of our common stock to be issued to Savara securityholders in the merger must have been approved for listing on the NYSE MKT; and\n\u2022\nthe contemplated reverse stock split must have become effective;\nWe cannot assure you that all of the conditions will be satisfied or waived. If the conditions are not satisfied or waived, the merger may not occur or will be delayed, and we each may lose some or all of the intended benefits of the merger.\nThe merger may be completed even though material adverse changes may result from the announcement of the merger, industry-wide changes and other causes.\nIn general, either Mast or Savara can refuse to complete the merger if there is a material adverse change affecting the other party between the date of the merger agreement, and the closing. However, certain types of changes do not permit either party to refuse to complete the merger, even if such change could be said to have a material adverse effect on Mast or Savara, including:\n\u2022\nany effect, change, event, circumstance or development in the conditions generally affecting the industries in which Savara and Mast operate or the United States or global economy or capital markets as a whole;\n\u2022\nany natural disaster or any acts of terrorism, sabotage, military action or war or any escalation of worsening thereof;\n\u2022\nany failure by Mast or Savara to meet internal projections or forecasts or third party revenue or earnings predictions for any period ending on or after January 6, 2017;\n\u2022\nany changes in GAAP or applicable legal requirements after January 6, 2017; or\n\u2022\nwith respect to Mast, any change in the price or trading volume of our common stock.\nIf adverse changes occur and Mast and Savara still complete the merger, the combined organization stock price may suffer. This in turn may reduce the value of the merger to the stockholders of Mast, Savara or both.\nSome Mast and Savara executive officers and directors have interests in the merger that are different from yours and that may influence them to support or approve the merger without regard to your interests.\nCertain officers and directors of Mast and Savara participate in arrangements that provide them with interests in the merger that are different from yours, including, among others, the continued service as an officer or director of the combined organization, severance benefits, cash and equity bonuses contingent upon the closing of the merger, continued indemnification and the potential ability to sell an increased number of shares of common stock of the combined organization in accordance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. For example, we previously entered into severance agreements with our executive officers that provide them with cash severance payments, cash payments intended to cover certain health insurance costs and the acceleration of their outstanding equity awards in the event their employment is terminated without cause following a change of control of our company. In addition, certain of our directors and executive officers have options and restricted stock units, or RSUs, which RSUs shall vest immediately prior to the date the merger is consummated, and our executive officers are eligible for a cash bonus award upon the closing of the merger. Two members of our board of directors are expected to continue as directors of the combined organization upon the closing of the merger, and all of our directors and executive officers are entitled to certain indemnification and liability insurance coverage pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement and coverage pursuant to our insurance policies.\nBased on the terms of their respective severance agreements, outstanding equity awards and incentive awards granted in January 2017, our executive officers will be entitled to receive a total value of approximately $2.5 million (collectively, not individually) in connection with the consummation of the merger and the associated termination of their employment from our company, based on data available as of March 2, 2017.\nThe market price of our common stock following the merger may decline as a result of the merger.\nThe market price of our common stock may decline as a result of the merger for a number of reasons including if:\n\u2022\ninvestors react negatively to the prospects of the combined organization\u2019s business and prospects from the merger;\n\u2022\nthe effect of the merger on the combined organization\u2019s business and prospects is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts; or\n\u2022\nthe combined organization does not achieve the perceived benefits of the merger as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts.\nOur stockholders may not realize a benefit from the merger commensurate with the ownership dilution they will experience in connection with the merger.\nIf the combined organization is unable to realize the full strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated from the merger, our stockholders will have experienced substantial dilution of their ownership interests in our company without receiving any commensurate benefit, or only receiving part of the commensurate benefit to the extent the combined organization is able to realize only part of the strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated from the merger.\nDuring the pendency of the merger, we may not be able to enter into a business combination with another party at a favorable price because of restrictions in the merger agreement, which could adversely affect our business.\nCovenants in the merger agreement impede the ability of Mast and Savara to make acquisitions, subject to certain exceptions relating to fiduciaries duties, as set forth below, or complete other transactions that are not in the ordinary course of business pending completion of the merger. As a result, if the merger is not completed, we may be at a disadvantage to our competitors during that period. In addition, while the merger agreement is in effect, each party is generally prohibited from soliciting, initiating, encouraging or entering into certain extraordinary transactions, such as a merger, sale of assets or other business combination outside the ordinary course of business, with any third party, subject to certain exceptions described below. These restrictions apply even if such transactions could be favorable to our stockholders.\nCertain provisions of the merger agreement may discourage third parties from submitting alternative takeover proposals, including proposals that may be superior to the arrangements contemplated by the merger agreement.\nThe terms of the merger agreement prohibit each of Mast and Savara from soliciting alternative takeover proposals or cooperating with persons making unsolicited takeover proposals, except in limited circumstances when such party\u2019s board of directors determines in good faith that an unsolicited alternative takeover proposal is or is reasonably likely to lead to a superior takeover proposal and is reasonably capable of being consummated and that failure to cooperate with the proponent of the proposal is reasonably likely to result in a breach of the board\u2019s fiduciary duties. In addition, if we or Savara terminate the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances, including terminating because of a decision of a board of directors to recommend a superior proposal, we would be required to pay a termination fee of $1.8 million to Savara or Savara would be required to pay a termination fee of $2.5 million to us, respectively. This termination fee may discourage third parties from submitting alternative takeover proposals to us or our stockholders, and may cause our board of directors to be less inclined to recommend an alternative proposal.\nBecause the lack of a public market for Savara shares makes it difficult to evaluate the fairness of the merger, the stockholders of Savara may receive consideration in the merger that is less than the fair market value of the Savara shares and/or we may pay more than the fair market value of the Savara shares.\nThe outstanding capital stock of Savara is privately held and is not traded in any public market. The lack of a public market makes it extremely difficult to determine the fair market value of Savara. Because the percentage of our equity to be issued to Savara securityholders was determined based on our negotiations with Savara, it is possible that the value of our common stock to be issued to Savara securityholders will be less than the fair market value of Savara, or we may pay more than the aggregate fair market value for Savara.\nThe exchange ratio is subject to an upward adjustment to the extent that our net cash at the effective time of the merger is less than zero dollars and as a result, our securityholders could own less of the combined company.\nThe exchange ratio is subject to an upward adjustment to the extent that our net cash at the effective time of the merger is less than zero dollars ($0.00) and, as a result, our securityholders could own less, and Savara securityholders could own more, of the combined company. Certain of our outstanding warrants provide that, in the event of certain fundamental transactions, whereby a person or group of persons acquires more than 50% of our common stock, then, holders of such outstanding warrants may elect and require us to purchase the warrants held by such holder by making a cash payment in an amount equal to the Black-Scholes Value of the remaining unexercised portion of such holder\u2019s warrants. We do not believe that any cash payment is required pursuant to the terms of the warrants as a result of the merger; provided, however, that if we shall be required pursuant to the terms of the warrants to make any cash payments or otherwise settle the warrants prior to closing, the exchange ratio could be adjusted to adversely impact the ownership of our stockholders in the combined company.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nRisks Related to Our Capital Requirements, Finances and Operations\nWe are a clinical-stage company with no drug products approved for commercial sale, we have incurred net losses since our inception, we expect to incur substantial losses and negative operating cash flow for the foreseeable future, and we need additional funding to continue to conduct our operations and advance development of our product candidates.\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company and have not generated sustainable revenue from operations or been profitable since inception, and we may never achieve profitability. We have devoted our resources to acquiring and developing proprietary product candidates, but such product candidates cannot be marketed until clinical development is completed and governmental approvals have been obtained. None of our product candidates has been approved for sale by any regulatory agency or is available for commercial sale and each will require significant additional capital to advance their development toward regulatory approval for commercial sale.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we incurred losses from operations of $36.5 million, $39.4 million and $29.3 million, respectively, and our net cash used in operating activities was $37.3 million, $32.9 million and $24.6 million, respectively. At December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $311.1 million, our cash, cash equivalents and investment securities were $11.3 million, and our working capital was $7.3 million. We expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses for the next several years as we advance our product candidates, which are in intermediary to early stages of development, through clinical studies and other development activities necessary to seek approval from the FDA and regulatory authorities outside of the U.S. to commercialize them. Accordingly, there is no current source of revenue from operations, much less profits, to sustain our present activities. Further, no revenue from operations will likely be available until, and unless, one of our product candidates is approved by the FDA or another regulatory agency and successfully marketed, or we enter into an arrangement that provides for licensing revenue or other partnering-related funding, outcomes which we may not achieve.\nWe estimate that our existing capital resources are sufficient to fund our current and planned operations into the second quarter of 2017. We are focused on managing our operating expenses and maintaining adequate cash to run our business through consummation of the proposed merger with Savara. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in completing the merger with Savara or in maintaining or raising sufficient additional capital to fund continued operations.\nWe cannot predict the extent of our future operating losses and accumulated deficit, and we may never generate sufficient revenues to achieve or sustain profitability. To become and remain profitable, we must succeed in developing and obtaining required regulatory approvals and commercializing our product candidates. This will require us to succeed in a range of challenging activities, and many aspects of drug development are inherently unpredictable. We may never succeed in obtaining the FDA\u2019s or another regulatory authority\u2019s approval to market our product candidates or otherwise generate revenues sufficient to achieve profitability. If we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain it.\nThere is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nAt December 31, 2016, our cash, cash equivalents and investment securities were $11.3 million and our working capital was $7.3 million. We continue to incur significant operating losses we do not believe our capital resources as of December 31, 2016 will be sufficient to fund our planned operations for the next 12 months, and we may not be able to raise additional capital as and when needed. These uncertainties raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.\nAs more fully discussed in Note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report and Part I, Item 2 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of this report, if we are unable to complete the proposed merger with Savara, we may elect to, among other things, attempt to complete another strategic transaction like the proposed merger, attempt to sell or otherwise dispose of our various assets, or continue to operate our business, focusing on advancing the development of AIR001. If our board of directors decides to dissolve our company and liquidate our assets, we would be required to pay all of our debts and contractual obligations, and to set aside certain reserves for potential future claims, and there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of available cash left to distribute to our stockholders after paying our debts and other obligations and setting aside funds for potential future claims. If we attempt to continue to operate our business, focusing on development of AIR001, we would need to raise significant additional funds to fund our operations and execute on our business strategy and we may not be successful in those efforts.\nWe have historically been able to raise capital through equity offerings; however, there is no assurance that we will be successful in that regard in the future or that we will be able to obtain sufficient, or any, additional capital on acceptable terms, or at all. Further, we have based our estimated capital needs on assumptions that may prove to be wrong and we cannot assure you that estimates and assumptions will not change. For example, we are currently assuming that the investigator-sponsored clinical studies of\nAIR001 we are supporting will be completed without our commitment of resources beyond what our current agreements require. If our estimated funding needs change and/or sufficient capital is not available, we may be required to further reduce the scope of, delay, or eliminate our ongoing and planned product development activities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and may impair our intangible assets. In addition, we have incurred and expect to incur significant costs related to the proposed merger, such as financial advisor, legal and accounting fees, some of which must be paid even if the merger is not completed, and the extent of these costs may exceed our current estimates.\nThe consolidated financial statements included in this report have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of the uncertainty related to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur product candidates are at intermediary to early stages of development, the success of our business currently is dependent largely on our ability to advance development of AIR001 for the treatment of HFpEF, and if clinical studies of AIR001 are not successful, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected and the price of our common stock may decline.\nNone of our product candidates has been approved for sale by any regulatory agency or is available for commercial sale. We are focusing our resources primarily on the development of AIR001. Accordingly, the success of our business currently is highly dependent on our ability, or that of a future partner, to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for and then successfully commercialize AIR001 and our efforts, or those of a future partner, in this regard may prove unsuccessful. Ongoing clinical studies of AIR001 may not demonstrate the safety and efficacy necessary to support continued clinical development. In addition, continued development of AIR001 will require significant additional research, formulation and manufacture development, and extensive clinical testing prior seeking regulatory approval for commercial sale and will take several years. The drug development and regulatory approval process is subject to many risks, including the risks discussed in other risk factors below, and AIR001 may never receive marketing approval from the FDA or any regulatory agency. If the results or timing of our clinical or nonclinical studies, regulatory filings, the regulatory process, regulatory developments, and other activities, actions or decisions related to AIR001 do not meet our expectations or those of securities market participants, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly. If any of our product candidates is approved by the FDA or any foreign regulatory agency, our ability to generate revenue will depend in substantial part on the extent to which that drug product is accepted by the medical community and reimbursed by third-party payors, as well as our ability to market and sell the product and ensure that our third-party manufacturers produce it in quantities sufficient to meet commercial demand, if any.\nThe terms of our debt facility place restrictions on our operating and financial flexibility, and failure to comply with covenants or to satisfy certain conditions of the agreement governing the debt facility may result in acceleration of our repayment obligations and foreclosure on our pledged assets, which could significantly harm our liquidity, financial condition, operating results, business and prospects and cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nAs of March 2, 2017, we had an outstanding principal balance of $3.0 million under our debt facility with Hercules Capital, Inc. and Hercules Technology III, L.P. (collectively referred to as Hercules) that is secured by a lien covering substantially all of our assets, excluding intellectual property, but including proceeds from the sale, licensing or disposition of our intellectual property. The loan and security agreement governing the debt facility requires us to comply with a number of covenants (affirmative and negative), including restrictive covenants that limit our ability to: incur additional indebtedness; encumber the collateral securing the loan; acquire, own or make investments; repurchase or redeem any class of stock or other equity interest; declare or pay any cash dividend or make a cash distribution on any class of stock or other equity interest; transfer a material portion of our assets; acquire other businesses; and merge or consolidate with or into any other organization or otherwise suffer a change in control, in each case subject to exceptions. Our intellectual property also is subject to customary negative covenants. In addition, subject to limited exceptions, Hercules could declare an event of default upon the occurrence of any event that it interprets as having a material adverse effect upon our business, operations, properties, assets, or financial condition or upon our ability to perform or pay the secured obligations under the loan and security agreement or upon the collateral or Hercules\u2019 liens on the collateral under the agreement, thereby requiring us to repay the loan immediately, together with a prepayment charge of up to 2% of the then outstanding principal balance and end-of-term charge of $712,500, or renegotiate the terms of the agreement. Although, in and of itself, the occurrence of adverse results or delays in any clinical study or the denial, delay or limitation of approval of or taking of any other regulatory action by the FDA or another governmental entity will not constitute a material adverse effect under our loan and security agreement with Hercules, Hercules may determine that such an event together with contemporaneous events or circumstances constitutes a material adverse effect upon our business, operations, properties, assets, or financial condition or upon our ability to perform or pay the secured obligations under the loan and security agreement. If we default under the facility, Hercules may accelerate all of our repayment obligations and, if we are unable to access funds to meet those obligations or to renegotiate our agreement, Hercules could take control of our pledged assets and we could immediately cease operations. If we were to renegotiate our agreement under such circumstances, the terms may be\nsignificantly less favorable to us. If we were liquidated, Hercules\u2019 right to repayment would be senior to the rights of our stockholders to receive any proceeds from the liquidation.\nIn connection with the proposed merger with Savara, because the merger would result in a change in control of our company and would otherwise trigger immediate repayment of the outstanding amount of all principal, accrued interest, accrued, unpaid fees and expenses, together with a prepayment charge of 2% of the principal balance and an end of term charge of $712,500 (referred to as the Change in Control Prepayment Provisions), in March 2017, we entered into an amendment to our loan and security agreement with Hercules. As a result of this amendment, the proposed merger with Savara would not trigger the Change in Control Repayment Provisions and the loan would remain in place upon its existing terms, including the January 1, 2019 scheduled maturity date, following consummation of the proposed merger provided the transaction is completed on or before April 30, 2017. However, beginning on the effective date of the amendment, the terms of the agreement, as amended, will include the minimum cash requirements described below. The amendment will become effective only if and as of the date of consummation of the merger with Savara. If the amendment becomes effective, the combined company would be required to maintain (a) at least $4 million of cash unless and until our company, Savara or the combined company raised at least $6 million in net cash proceeds from equity and/or subordinated debt financings on or before April 30, 2017 and (b) at least $2 million of cash unless and until our company, Savara or the combined company raised at least $20 million in net cash proceeds from equity and/or subordinated debt financings and/or other financing sources approved by Hercules (including grant amounts) on or before August 31, 2017. The combined company\u2019s failure to comply with these requirements would be an event of default, providing Hercules with the right to require immediate repayment in full of the loan and to exercise other remedies against combined company, including those described above.\nAny declaration by Hercules of an event of default could significantly harm our liquidity, financial condition, operating results, business, and prospects and cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nWe will need to obtain additional funding to pursue our current business strategy and continue as a going concern and we may not be able to obtain such funding on a timely basis, or on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Any capital-raising transaction we are able to complete may result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders, require us to relinquish significant rights, or restrict our operations.\nAs discussed above, based on our projected operating expenses and capital needs, our cash, cash equivalents and investment securities as of December 31, 2016, we believe that our capital resources will be sufficient to fund our operations into the second quarter of 2017, but, if the proposed merger with Savara is not completed within the timeframe we currently expect, or at all, we would need additional capital to continue operations. We may utilize our current financial resources sooner than we currently expect if we incur unanticipated expenses or the estimates and assumptions on which we have based our estimated capital needs prove to be wrong, in which case our capital resources may not be sufficient to fund operations into the second quarter of 2017.\nAlthough we were able to raise significant funds in the past through equity financings and a debt financing, the conditions of and our access to capital markets are highly variable and adequate additional equity or debt financing may not be available to us in the future on acceptable terms, or on a timely basis, or at all. Further, each of these financing alternatives carries risks. Raising capital through the issuance of our common stock, or securities convertible into or exercisable for our common stock, may depress the market price of our stock and may substantially dilute our existing stockholders. In addition, even if we were able to raise capital through the sale and issuance of our common stock, we may not have enough authorized common stock available to raise additional capital that would be sufficient to fund planned operations for the next 12 months. As of March 2, 2017, approximately 115 million of our authorized shares of common stock were not outstanding or reserved for issuance under outstanding warrants and equity awards, equity incentive plans or other rights. Assuming a sale price of $0.12 per share, which was the closing price of our common stock on March 2, 2017, gross proceeds from the sale of all 115 million available shares would be approximately $13.8 million, but any financing transaction available to us in the near-term likely would involve a sale price at a discount to market and/or significant warrant coverage. Assuming 100% warrant coverage and a sale price of $0.12 per unit, gross proceeds from the sale of all 115 million available shares would be approximately $6.9 million. If instead we seek to raise capital through strategic transactions, such as licensing arrangements or sales of one or more of our technologies or product candidates, we may be required to relinquish valuable rights and dilute the current and future value of our assets. For example, any licensing arrangement likely would require us to share with our licensee a significant portion of any revenues generated by our licensed technologies. Additionally, our control over the development and/or marketing of any products or product candidates licensed or sold to third parties likely would be reduced and thus we may not realize the full value of any such products or product candidates. Debt financings would likely involve covenants and/or repayment provisions that would restrict our operations. These restrictive covenants may include limitations on additional borrowing and specific restrictions on the use of our assets, including requirements to maintain specified amounts of cash or restrictions on our ability to license or sell our intellectual property assets, as well as prohibitions on our ability to create liens or make investments and may, among other things, preclude us from making distributions to stockholders (either by paying dividends or redeeming stock) and taking other actions beneficial to our stockholders. In addition, investors could impose more one-sided investment terms and conditions on companies that have or are perceived to have limited remaining funds or limited ability to raise additional funds. The lower our cash balance, the more difficult it is likely to be for us to raise additional capital on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nNotwithstanding efforts on our part to raise additional capital, adequate additional funding may not be available on acceptable terms, or on a timely basis, or at all. We may incur significant costs in pursuing, evaluating and negotiating particular capital-raising and/or strategic or partnering transactions, even if our efforts prove unsuccessful.\nWe believe global economic conditions, such as volatility in the U.S. and international equity markets, may adversely impact our ability to raise additional capital. Our failure to raise capital as needed would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and ability to pursue our business strategy and we potentially may be unable to continue as a going concern and required to liquidate our assets and dissolve our company.\nIf we are unable to consummate the proposed merger with Savara or raise sufficient additional capital as needed, we may be forced to delay, reduce or discontinue development of our product candidates, partner them or dispose of our assets at inopportune times or pursue less expensive but higher-risk and/or lower-return development paths.\nIf we are not able to consummate the proposed merger with Savara or raise sufficient additional capital as needed, we may be required to delay, reduce or discontinue one or more of our development programs, to seek collaborators or buyers at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or on terms less favorable than might otherwise be available, or to liquidate our assets and dissolve our company. For example, if we do not have sufficient capital, we may determine to delay or suspend planned or ongoing clinical or nonclinical studies or other development activities and/or not to conduct other studies or activities intended to enhance our intellectual property position, improve the probability of regulatory approval, or expand the scope of a product candidate\u2019s clinical benefit and market potential. Delays in and/or reduction of development activities could impair our ability to realize the full clinical and market potential of a product candidate and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. In addition, suspension or discontinuation of a development program may be viewed negatively, which could adversely affect our stock price.\nTo the extent we discontinue independent development of a product candidate, we may not realize any value from our investment in the discontinued program. Even if we pursue a strategic option, such as partnering, selling or exclusively licensing the program to a third party, such an option may not be available on acceptable terms or at all, and we may not realize any return on our investment in the program.\nIn addition, if we determine our financial resources are insufficient to fund our operations even after implementing additional cost saving measures and reducing the scope of our operations, we may be required to dispose of or liquidate our assets at values significantly less than what we believe their values to be and at which they are carried on our financial statements.\nThe process of developing and seeking regulatory approval of, and ultimately commercializing, investigational new drug products requires expenditure of substantial resources, and we cannot estimate with reasonable certainty the duration of or costs to complete our development programs.\nOur capital requirements for the foreseeable future will depend in large part on, and could increase significantly as a result of, our expenditures on our development programs. Future expenditures on our development programs are subject to many uncertainties, and will depend on, and could increase significantly as a result of, many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe number, size, complexity, results and timing of our drug development programs;\n\u2022\nthe timing and terms of any collaborative or other strategic arrangement that we may establish;\n\u2022\nthe number of clinical and nonclinical studies necessary to demonstrate acceptable evidence of the safety and efficacy of a product candidate in a particular indication;\n\u2022\nthe number of patients who participate, the rate of enrollment, and the ratio of randomized to evaluable patients in each clinical study;\n\u2022\nthe number and location of sites and the rate of site initiation in each study;\n\u2022\nthe duration of patient treatment and follow-up;\n\u2022\nthe potential for additional safety monitoring or other post-marketing studies that may be requested by regulatory agencies;\n\u2022\nthe time and cost to manufacture clinical trial material and commercial product, including process development and scale-up activities, and to conduct stability studies, which can last several years;\n\u2022\nthe degree of difficulty and cost involved in securing alternate manufacturers or suppliers of drug product, components or delivery devices, as necessary to meet FDA requirements and/or commercial demand;\n\u2022\nthe costs, requirements, timing of, and the ability to, secure regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which we increase our workforce and the costs involved in recruiting, training and incentivizing new employees;\n\u2022\nthe costs related to developing, acquiring and/or contracting for sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, supply chain management capabilities, and regulatory compliance capabilities, if we obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate and commercialize it without a partner;\n\u2022\ncompeting technologies and market developments; and\n\u2022\nthe costs involved in establishing, enforcing or defending patent claims and other proprietary rights.\nWe may not be able to raise capital when needed or reduce other expenditures to offset expenditures on our development programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and ability to pursue our business strategy.\nOur ability to raise capital may be limited by applicable laws and regulations.\nHistorically, we have raised capital primarily through the sale of our equity securities. In recent years, we have raised substantial funding through equity offerings conducted under \u201cshelf\u201d registration statements on Form S-3. Using a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 to raise additional capital generally takes less time and is less expensive than other means, such as conducting an offering under a Form S-1 registration statement. However, our ability to raise capital using a shelf registration statement may be limited by, among other things, current SEC rules and regulations. Under current SEC rules and regulations, we must meet certain requirements to use a Form S-3 registration statement to raise capital without restriction as to the amount of the market value of securities sold thereunder. One such requirement is that the market value of our outstanding common stock held by non-affiliates, or public float, be at least $75.0 million as of a date within 60 days prior to the date of filing the Form S-3. If we do not meet that requirement, then the aggregate market value of securities sold by us or on our behalf under the Form S-3 in any 12-month period is limited to an aggregate of one-third of our public float. Moreover, even if we meet the public float requirement at the time we file a Form S-3, SEC rules and regulations require that we periodically re-evaluate the value of our public float, and if, at a re-evaluation date, our public float is less than $75.0 million, we would become subject to the one-third of public float limitation described above. If our ability to utilize a Form S-3 registration statement for a primary offering of our securities is limited to one-third of our public float, we may conduct such an offering pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act or under a Form S-1 registration statement, which we have done in the past, including in June 2013, and we would expect either of those alternatives to increase the cost of raising additional capital relative to utilizing a Form S-3 registration statement.\nIn addition, under current SEC rules and regulations, our common stock must be listed and registered on a national securities exchange in order to utilize a Form S-3 registration statement (i) for a primary offering, if our public float is not at least $75.0 million as of a date within 60 days prior to the date of filing the Form S-3, or a re-evaluation date, whichever is later, and (ii) to register the resale of our securities by persons other than us (i.e., a resale offering). While currently our common stock is listed on the NYSE MKT equities market, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain such listing. The NYSE MKT reviews the appropriateness of continued listing of any issuer that falls below the exchange\u2019s continued listing standards. For additional information regarding this risk, see the risk factor below titled \u201cIf we are unable to maintain compliance with NYSE MKT continued listing standards and policies, the NYSE MKT may commence proceedings to delist our common stock, and in some cases, determine to suspend trading in our common stock immediately without an opportunity to propose a plan that could enable us to regain compliance, which would likely cause the liquidity and market price of our common stock to decline and you could lose your investment.\u201d\nOur ability to timely raise sufficient additional capital also may be limited by the NYSE MKT\u2019s stockholder approval requirements for transactions involving the issuance of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock. For instance, the NYSE MKT requires that we obtain stockholder approval of any transaction involving the sale, issuance or potential issuance by us of our common stock (or securities convertible into our common stock) at a price less than the greater of book or market value, which (together with sales by our officers, directors and principal stockholders) equals 20% or more of our then outstanding common stock, unless the transaction is considered a \u201cpublic offering\u201d by the NYSE MKT staff. Based on 254,746,933 shares of our common stock outstanding as of March 2, 2017 and the closing price per share of our common stock on such date, which was $0.12, we could not raise more than approximately $6.1 million without obtaining stockholder approval, unless the transaction is deemed a public offering or does not involve the sale, issuance or potential issuance by us of our common stock (or securities convertible into our common stock) at a price less than the greater of book or market value. In addition, certain prior sales by us may\nbe aggregated with any offering we may propose in the future, further limiting the amount we could raise in any future offering that is not considered a public offering by the NYSE MKT staff and involves the sale, issuance or potential issuance by us of our common stock (or securities convertible into our common stock) at a price less than the greater of book or market value. The NYSE MKT also requires that we obtain stockholder approval if the issuance or potential issuance of additional shares will be considered by the NYSE MKT staff to result in a change of control of our company.\nObtaining stockholder approval is a costly and time-consuming process. If we are required to obtain stockholder approval for a potential transaction, we would expect to spend substantial additional money and resources. In addition, seeking stockholder approval would delay our receipt of otherwise available capital, which may materially and adversely affect our ability to execute our current business strategy, and there is no guarantee our stockholders ultimately would approve a proposed transaction. A public offering under the NYSE MKT rules typically involves broadly announcing the proposed transaction, which often times has the effect of depressing the issuer\u2019s stock price, as occurred following our issuance of a press release on February 9, 2016 announcing a proposed underwritten public offering. Accordingly, the price at which we could sell our securities in a public offering may be less, and the dilution existing stockholders experience may in turn be greater, than if we were able to raise capital through other means.\nWe have significant goodwill and IPR&D and impairment of goodwill and IPR&D may have a significant adverse impact on our future financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had goodwill and IPR&D of approximately $5.5 million, representing approximately 31% of our total assets. Our intangible assets are subject to an impairment analysis whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates the carrying amount of such an asset may not be recoverable. We test our goodwill and IPR&D for impairment annually, or more frequently if an event or change in circumstances indicates that the asset may be impaired. If an impairment is identified, we would be required to record an impairment charge with respect to the impaired asset to our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. A significant impairment charge could have a material negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFor example, our IPR&D resulted from our acquisitions of SynthRx and Aires Pharmaceuticals in 2011 and 2014, respectively, through which we acquired our vepoloxamer and AIR001 programs, respectively. Based on our assessment of fair value of our vepoloxamer-related IPR&D as of December 31, 2016, we reduced the carrying value of our IPR&D by $6.0 million to $0.5 million and recorded an impairment charge of $6.0 million as a separate operating expense in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nWe will continue to evaluate our intangible assets for potential impairment in accordance with our accounting policies. If additional impairments are identified, we would be required to record an impairment charge with respect to the impaired asset to our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. A significant impairment charge could have a material negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nEvents giving rise to impairment are difficult to predict and are an inherent risk in the pharmaceutical industry. Some of the potential risks that could result in impairment of our goodwill and IPR&D include negative clinical study results, adverse regulatory developments, delay or failure to obtain regulatory approval, additional development costs, changes in the manner of our use or development of vepoloxamer or AIR001, competition, earlier than expected loss of exclusivity, pricing pressures, higher operating costs, changes in tax laws, prices that third parties are willing to pay for our IPR&D or similar assets in an arm\u2019s-length transaction being less than the carrying value of our IPR&D, and other market and economic environment changes or trends. Events or changes in circumstances may lead to significant impairment charges on our goodwill and/or IPR&D in the future, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nLoss of personnel, through reductions in force or otherwise, could adversely impact our ability to successfully manage our business.\nWe implemented significant cost-saving measures in 2016, including by restructuring our organization and reducing our workforce by more than 70%. As a result, remaining employees may have to take on substantially more responsibility, resulting in greater workload demands and potential diversion of attention away from key areas of our business. Discontinuation of the vepoloxamer clinical development programs and implementation of other cost-saving measures, including reductions in force, create uncertainty and can negatively affect staff morale, which may lead remaining employees to seek different employment. All of our employment relationships are at-will and we may lose employees not affected by reductions in force at any time if they choose to terminate their employment with us. Loss of a significant proportion of our employees and/or loss of key employees could not only serve as a distraction to remaining employees but could also cause some loss of institutional knowledge and divert significant management time and attention, which could negatively affect business strategy and execution, and our results of operations and financial condition could suffer as a result.\nReplacing key employees may be a difficult, costly and protracted process, and we may not have other personnel with the capacity to assume all of the responsibilities of a key employee upon his/her departure. Transition periods can be difficult to manage and may cause disruption to our business. In addition, there may be intense competition from other companies and organizations for qualified personnel. Other companies and organizations with which we compete for personnel may have greater financial and other resources and different risk profiles than we do, and a history of successful development and commercialization of their product candidates, which may make them more attractive employers. Our ability to compete for qualified personnel also may be adversely affected by our highly volatile stock price. The value of equity awards we may offer to candidates to induce their employment and to our employees to retain and incentivize them is significantly affected by movements in our stock price that we cannot control and may at any time be insufficient to counteract more lucrative offers from other companies. If we cannot attract and retain skilled personnel, as needed, we may not achieve our development and other goals.\nIn the meantime, the success of our business likely will depend in part on our ability to develop and maintain relationships with respected service providers and industry-leading consultants and advisers. If we cannot develop and maintain such relationships, as needed, the rate and success at which we can develop and commercialize product candidates may be limited. In addition, our outsourcing strategy, which has included engaging consultants that spend considerable time in our office to manage key functional areas, may subject us to scrutiny under labor laws and regulations, which may divert management time and attention and have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe expend substantial resources to comply with laws and regulations relating to public companies, and any failure to maintain compliance could subject us to regulatory scrutiny and cause investors to lose confidence in our company, which could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our stock price.\nLaws and regulations affecting public companies, including provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or SOX, and the related rules and regulations adopted by the SEC and by the NYSE MKT have resulted in, and will continue to result in, significant costs to us as we evaluate the implications of these rules and respond to their requirements. For example, compliance with Section 404 of SOX, including performing the system and process documentation and evaluation necessary to issue our annual report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and, if applicable, obtain the required attestation report from our independent registered public accounting firm, requires us to incur substantial expense and expend significant management time. Further, we have in the past discovered, and may in the future discover, areas of internal controls that need improvement. If we identify deficiencies in our internal controls that are deemed to be material weaknesses, we could become subject to scrutiny by regulatory authorities and lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price. Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and circumvention by collusion or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even an effective internal control system may not prevent or detect material misstatements on a timely basis, or at all. Also, previously effective controls may become inadequate over time as a result of changes in our business or operating structure, and we may fail to take measures to evaluate the adequacy of and update these controls, as necessary, which could lead to a material misstatement. For example, loss of staff and other resources in our accounting department as a result of cost-saving measures or otherwise, could negatively impact our ability to maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting and/or disclosure controls and procedures and the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting. Consequently, investor confidence in our financial reports may be adversely affected, which could negatively impact our stock price.\nIn addition, new laws and regulations could make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the coverage that is the same or similar to our current coverage. The impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or board committees, and as our executive officers. We cannot predict or estimate with any reasonable accuracy the total amount or timing of the costs we may incur to comply with these laws and regulations.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carry forwards and research and development tax credits to offset future taxable income or future tax will be limited, and may be limited further in the future, due to changes in ownership (within the meaning of IRC Section 382) that have occurred and may occur in the future, including as a result of the proposed merger with Savara.\nIn general, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or IRC, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses, or NOLs, and certain other tax assets to offset future taxable income, and an ownership change is generally defined as a cumulative change of 50% or more in the ownership positions of certain stockholders during a rolling three-year period. In 2012, we had identified an ownership change within the meaning of IRC Section 382 that occurred on November 11, 2011 as a result of an equity financing we completed on that date and, consequently, we do not expect to be eligible to utilize the NOL carry forwards and research and development tax credits we had accumulated as of November 11, 2011. We completed a formal study to determine if any ownership changes within\nthe meaning of IRC Section 382 had occurred during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014. None were identified. However, other ownership changes within the meaning of IRC Section 382 may occur in the future or may already have occurred in connection with the public offering of our common stock and warrants completed in February 2016, which could eliminate or restrict our ability to use NOL carry forwards and research and development tax credits generated after November 11, 2011.\nIn addition, the proposed merger with Savara likely will result in an ownership change for our company under Sections 382 and 383 of the IRC. Accordingly, our pre-merger NOL carryforwards and certain other tax attributes would be subject to limitations on their use after the merger. The NOL carryforwards and certain other tax attributes of Savara and of the combined company may also be subject to limitations on their use after the merger if the merger also results in an ownership change for Savara.\nLimitations on our ability to use NOL carry forwards and research and development tax credits to offset future taxable income could require us to pay U.S. federal income taxes earlier than would be required if such limitations were not in effect. Similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of computer system failures, cyber-attacks on our systems or deficiency in our cyber security.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems, and those of third parties on which we rely, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, malware, natural disasters, fire, terrorism, war and telecommunication, electrical failures, cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions over the Internet, attachments to emails, persons inside our organization, or persons with access to systems inside our organization. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments, and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. In addition, our systems or those of third parties on which we rely safeguard important confidential personal data regarding our employees and patients enrolled in our clinical trials. If a disruption event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a disruption of our drug development programs. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed, ongoing or planned clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and development of our product candidates could be delayed.\nOur employees, independent contractors and consultants, principal investigators, CROs, CMOs and other vendors, and any future commercial partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could cause significant liability for us and harm our reputation.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees, independent contractors and consultants, principal investigators, CROs, CMOs and other vendors, and any future commercial partners may engage in fraudulent conduct or other misconduct, including intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations or similar regulations of comparable foreign regulatory authorities, to provide accurate information to the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, to comply with manufacturing standards required by cGMP or that we establish, to comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations and similar laws and regulations established and enforced by comparable foreign regulatory authorities, and to report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. The misconduct of our employees and others we engage to provide services to us could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. We maintain a code of business conduct and ethics for our directors, officers and employees, but it is not always possible to identify and deter such misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and results of operations, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nOur operations might be interrupted by the occurrence of a natural disaster or other catastrophic event.\nOur corporate headquarters are located in a single commercial facility in San Diego, California. Important documents and records, including copies of our regulatory documents and other records for our product candidates, are located at our facilities and we depend on our facilities for the continued operation of our business. Natural disasters and other catastrophic events, such as wildfires and other fires, earthquakes and extended power interruptions, which have impacted San Diego businesses in the past, and terrorist attacks or severe weather conditions, could significantly disrupt our operations and result in additional, unplanned expense. As a small company with limited resources, we have not prepared or implemented a formal business continuity or disaster recovery plan and any natural disaster or catastrophic event could disrupt our business operations and result in setbacks to our development programs. Even\nthough we believe we carry commercially reasonable insurance, we might suffer losses that are not covered by or exceed the coverage available under these insurance policies.\nRisks Related to Drug Development and Commercialization\nWe depend on the successful completion of clinical studies of our product candidates and positive results in prior clinical studies do not ensure that ongoing or future clinical studies will be successful.\nHuman pharmaceutical products generally are subject to rigorous nonclinical testing and clinical studies and other approval procedures mandated by the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities. Before obtaining regulatory approval for the commercial sale of a product candidate, we must demonstrate through additional clinical studies that the drug product is safe and effective for use in the target indication.\nClinical studies are expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete, and outcomes are inherently uncertain. A drug product may fail to demonstrate positive results at any stage of testing despite having progressed satisfactorily through nonclinical testing and initial clinical studies. In addition, interim results of a clinical study do not necessarily predict final results. Further, clinical study data frequently are susceptible to varying interpretations. Medical professionals and/or regulatory authorities may analyze or weigh study data differently than we do, resulting in delay or failure to obtain marketing approval for a product candidate.\nIf we license rights to develop our product candidates to independent third parties or otherwise permit such third parties to evaluate our product candidates in clinical studies, we may have limited control over those clinical studies. For example, AIR001 is being evaluated in investigator-sponsored clinical studies over which we have limited or no control over the study design or implementation and we cannot provide assurance that any of those studies will be completed on anticipated timelines or at all. Any safety or efficacy concern identified in a third-party sponsored study could adversely affect our or another licensee\u2019s development of our product candidate and prospects for its regulatory approval, even if the data from that study are susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses.\nThere is significant risk that ongoing and future clinical studies of our product candidates are unsuccessful. Negative or inconclusive results could cause the FDA and other regulatory authorities to require that we repeat or conduct additional clinical studies, which could significantly increase the time and expense associated with development of that product candidate or cause us to elect to discontinue one or more clinical programs. For example, in September 2016, we announced that our Phase 3 clinical study of vepoloxamer in sickle cell disease did not achieve its primary or secondary efficacy endpoints. Shortly thereafter and as a result, we decided to discontinue our clinical development programs for vepoloxamer in sickle cell disease and heart failure. Failure to complete a clinical study of a product candidate or an unsuccessful completion of a clinical study of a product candidate could have a material adverse effect on our business and/or stock price.\nAll ongoing and currently planned clinical studies of our lead product candidate, AIR001, are investigator-sponsored studies over which we have limited or no control.\nAIR001 is our lead product candidate and is being evaluated in multiple, investigator-sponsored Phase 2 clinical studies for the treatment of patients with HFpEF. As a result, we believe our capital requirements for advancing development of AIR001 in HFpEF are significantly less than if we were to conduct this Phase 2 clinical testing ourselves. However, because we are not the sponsor of these studies, we have limited or no control over the study design or execution, including whether the study will enroll a sufficient number of subjects or be completed on schedule, if at all. As a result, successful completion of these studies is largely outside of our control.\nDelays in commencement and completion of clinical studies are common and have many causes. Delays in clinical studies of our product candidates could increase overall development costs and jeopardize our ability to obtain regulatory approval and successfully commercialize any approved products.\nClinical testing typically is expensive, can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Clinical studies may not commence on time or be completed on schedule, if at all. The commencement and completion of clinical studies can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including:\n\u2022\ninability to raise sufficient funding, if necessary, to initiate or continue a clinical study;\n\u2022\ndelays in obtaining regulatory approval to commence a clinical study;\n\u2022\ndelays in identifying and reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical study sites and investigators, which agreements can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among study sites;\n\u2022\ndelays in obtaining institutional review board, or IRB, approval to conduct a clinical study at a prospective site;\n\u2022\ndelays in reaching agreements on acceptable terms with prospective contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, or other vendors for the production and supply of clinical trial material and, if necessary, drug administration devices, which agreements can be subject to extensive negotiation;\n\u2022\ndelays in the production and/or delivery of sufficient quantities of clinical trial material or drug administration devices from our CMOs and other vendors to initiate or continue a clinical study;\n\u2022\ndelays on the part of our CROs, CMOs, and other third-party contractors in developing procedures and protocols or otherwise conducting activities in accordance with applicable policies and procedures and in accordance with agreed upon timelines;\n\u2022\ndelays in identifying and hiring or engaging, as applicable, additional employees or consultants to assist in managing clinical study-related activities;\n\u2022\ndelays in recruiting and enrolling individuals to participate in a clinical study;\n\u2022\ndelays caused by subjects dropping out of a clinical study due to side effects, difficulties in adhering to the study protocol, or otherwise;\n\u2022\ndelays in having subjects complete participation in a clinical study, including returning for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u2022\ndelays resulting from study sites dropping out of a trial or providing inadequate staff support for the study;\n\u2022\nour suspension of enrollment at a study site or the imposition of a clinical hold by the FDA or other regulatory authority following an inspection of clinical study operations at study sites or finding of a drug-related serious adverse event; and\n\u2022\ndelays in quality control/quality assurance procedures necessary for study database lock and analysis of unblinded data.\nPatient enrollment, a critical component to successful completion of a clinical study, is affected by many factors, including the size and nature of the study subject population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the study, the design of the clinical study, competing clinical studies and clinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages of the drug being studied in relation to available alternatives, including therapies being investigated by other companies. Further, completion of a clinical study and/or its results may be adversely affected by failure to retain subjects who enroll in a study but withdraw due to adverse side effects, perceived lack of efficacy, improvement in condition before treatment has been completed, or for personal issues or by subjects who fail to return for or complete post-treatment follow-up.\nClinical studies may not begin on time or be completed in the timeframes we anticipate and may be more costly than we anticipate for a variety of reasons, including one or more of those described above. The length of time necessary to complete clinical studies varies significantly and is difficult to predict accurately. We may make statements regarding anticipated timing for completion of enrollment in and/or availability of results from our clinical studies, but such predictions are subject to a number of significant assumptions and actual timing may differ materially for a variety of reasons, including patient enrollment rates, length of time needed to prepare raw study data for analysis and then to review and analyze it, and other factors described above. In addition, in the case of AIR001, we are supporting but are not sponsoring the ongoing Phase 2 clinical studies and, as a result, the continuation and completion of and receipt of data from those studies may be largely outside of our control. If we experience delays in the completion of a clinical study, if a clinical study is terminated, or if failure to conduct a study in accordance with regulatory requirements or the study\u2019s protocol leads to deficient safety and/or efficacy data, the regulatory approval and/or commercial prospects for our product candidate may be harmed and our ability to generate product revenue will be delayed. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical studies likely will increase our development costs. Further, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical studies may ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate. Even if we are able to ultimately commercialize our product candidates, other therapies for the same indications may be introduced to the market in the interim and establish a competitive advantage or diminish the need for our products.\nClinical studies are very expensive, difficult to design and implement, often take many years to complete, and the outcome is inherently uncertain.\nClinical development of pharmaceutical products for humans generally is very expensive, takes many years to complete and failure can occur at any stage of clinical testing. We estimate that clinical development of our product candidates will take several additional years to complete, but because of the variety of factors that can affect the design, timing and outcome of clinical studies, we are unable to estimate the actual funds required to complete research and development and commercialize our product candidates. We will need significant additional capital to continue to advance AIR001 for the treatment of HFpEF.\nFailure at every stage of clinical testing is not uncommon and we may encounter problems that would require additional, unplanned studies or cause us to abandon a clinical development program. For example, we determined to discontinue clinical development of vepoloxamer in sickle cell disease based upon the top-line results of the Phase 3 study of vepoloxamer in sickle cell disease. If results of ongoing investigator-sponsored clinical studies of AIR001 in HFpEF are negative or inconclusive, we may determine not to pursue additional clinical studies in HFpEF or any other indication.\nIn addition, a clinical study may be suspended or terminated by us, an IRB, a data safety monitoring board, the FDA or other regulatory authorities due to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nlack of adequate funding to continue the study;\n\u2022\nfailure to conduct the study in accordance with regulatory requirements or the study\u2019s protocol;\n\u2022\ninspection of clinical study operations or sites by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold;\n\u2022\nunforeseen safety issues, including adverse side effects; or\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulations or administrative actions.\nChanges in governmental regulations and guidance relating to clinical studies may occur and we may need to amend study protocols to reflect these changes, or we may amend study protocols for other reasons. Amendments may require us to resubmit protocols to IRBs for reexamination or renegotiate terms with CROs, study sites and investigators, all of which may adversely impact the costs or timing of or our ability to successfully complete a trial.\nThere is significant uncertainty regarding the regulatory approval process for any investigational new drug, substantial further testing and validation of our product candidates and related manufacturing processes are required, and regulatory approval may be conditioned, delayed or denied, which could delay or prevent us from successfully marketing our product candidates and substantially harm our business.\nHuman pharmaceutical products generally are subject to rigorous nonclinical testing and clinical studies and other approval procedures mandated by the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities. Various federal and foreign statutes and regulations also govern or influence the manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, record keeping and marketing of pharmaceutical products. The process of obtaining these approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate U.S. and foreign statutes and regulations is time-consuming and requires the expenditure of substantial resources.\nWe expect our MAST platform to accelerate development of vepoloxamer as compared to other new molecular entities for therapeutic use in humans. For example, we consider vepoloxamer \u201cPhase 2 ready\u201d for clinical development in ischemic stroke. However, this expectation is predicated on the belief that regulatory authorities, such as the FDA, will consider clinical and nonclinical studies of vepoloxamer and poloxamer 188 conducted by prior sponsors and/or conducted in other diseases or conditions supportive of clinical development of vepoloxamer in stroke, which may not be the case for a variety of reasons. If regulatory agencies take the position that prior-sponsor studies of vepoloxamer and poloxamer 188 do not support the safety and efficacy of our vepoloxamer-based product candidates, they may require additional testing of our product candidates prior to allowing us to proceed with proposed clinical studies or ultimately prior to granting marketing approval, which could require us to expend substantial additional resources and significantly extend the timeline for clinical development of vepoloxamer in stroke.\nSignificant uncertainty exists with respect to the regulatory approval process for any investigational new drug, including our lead product candidate, AIR001. Regardless of guidance the FDA may give a drug\u2019s sponsor during its development, the FDA retains complete discretion in deciding whether to accept a NDA for filing or, if accepted, approve an NDA. There are many components to a new drug application (NDA) submission in addition to clinical study data. For example, the FDA will review our internal systems and processes, as well as those of our CROs, CMOs and other vendors, related to development of our product candidate, including those\npertaining to our clinical studies and manufacturing processes. Before accepting an NDA for review or before approving the NDA, the FDA may request that we provide additional information that may require significant resources and time to generate and there is no guarantee that our product candidate will be approved for any indication for which we may apply. The FDA may choose not to approve an NDA for any of a variety of reasons, including a decision related to the safety or efficacy data, manufacturing controls or systems, or for any other issues that the agency may identify related to the development of our product candidate. Even if one or more Phase 3 clinical studies are successful in providing statistically significant evidence of the efficacy and safety of the investigational drug, the FDA may not consider efficacy and safety data from the submitted studies adequate scientific support for a conclusion of effectiveness and/or safety and may require an additional Phase 3 or other studies prior to granting marketing approval. If this were to occur, the overall development cost for the product candidate would be substantially greater and our competitors may bring products to market before us, which could impair our ability to generate revenues from the product and have a material adverse effect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, development of our product candidates and/or regulatory approval may be delayed for reasons beyond our control. For example, U.S. federal government shut-down or budget sequestration, such as occurred during 2013, may result in significant reductions to the FDA\u2019s budget and operations, which may lead to slower response times and longer review periods, potentially affecting our ability to progress development of or obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates.\nEven if the FDA grants approval, the conditions or scope of the approval may limit successful commercialization of the product and impair our ability to generate substantial sales revenue. For example, the FDA may not approve the labeling claims for our products that we request and believe are necessary or desirable for successful commercialization, or may grant marketing approval contingent on the performance of costly post-approval clinical trials or subject to warnings or contraindications. Additionally, even after granting approval, the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for our products will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration, and continued compliance with current good manufacturing processes, or cGMP, good clinical practices, international conference on harmonization regulations and good laboratory practices, which are regulations and guidelines that are enforced by the FDA for all of our clinical development and for any clinical studies that we conduct post-approval. The FDA may decide to withdraw approval, add warnings or narrow the approved indications in the product label, or establish risk management programs that could restrict distribution of our products. These actions could result from, among other things, safety concerns, including unexpected side effects or drug-drug interaction problems, or concerns over misuse of a product. If any of these actions were to occur following approval, we may have to discontinue commercialization of the product, limit our sales and marketing efforts, and/or conduct post-approval studies, which in turn could result in significant expense and delay or limit our ability to generate sales revenues.\nWe do not have, and do not have plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities and are dependent on third parties for the manufacture and supply of our clinical trial materials, and the loss of any of these vendors or their failure to provide us with an adequate supply of clinical trial material in a timely manner and on commercially acceptable terms, or at all, could harm our business.\nWe do not have, and do not have plans to establish, our own manufacturing facilities. For clinical trial material, we entered into supply agreements with third parties for both API and finished drug product, but our agreements may not cover all of our clinical trial material needs and we may need to negotiate new or amended agreements with these CMOs and other vendors or rely on individual proposals or statements of work, which inherently involves uncertainty as to ongoing supply and may result in delays in the completion of ongoing clinical studies or initiation of new studies. In addition, as development of our product candidates progress, we will need to negotiate agreements for commercial supply; however, we may not be able to reach agreement on acceptable terms. If we fail to maintain relationships with our current CMOs and other vendors, we may not be able to complete development of our product candidates, or market them, if approved, on a timely basis, or at all, which would have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, in connection with terminating our clinical development of vepoloxamer, we also terminated our agreements with our vepoloxamer-related CMOs and other vendors. Consequently, if we were to restart clinical development of vepoloxamer, we would have to establish new CMO relationships and may not be able to do so on a timely basis, or at all.\nThird-party manufacturers and suppliers may not perform as agreed or may terminate their agreements with us. For example, because these third parties provide manufacturing services to a number of other pharmaceutical companies, they may experience capacity constraints or choose to prioritize one or more of their other customers over us. Any significant problem that our manufacturers or suppliers experience could delay or interrupt our supply of clinical trial material or commercial product until the manufacturer or supplier cures the problem or until we locate, negotiate for and validate an alternative source of supply, if one is available.\nIn addition to our reliance on third parties to manufacture clinical trial material, we rely on them to conduct or assist us in conducting key manufacturing development activities, including qualification of equipment, developing and validating methods,\ndefining critical process parameters, releasing component materials and conducting stability testing, among other things. If these third parties are unable to perform successfully in a timely manner, whether for technical, financial or other reasons, we may be unable to secure clinical trial material, which likely would delay the initiation, conduct or completion of our clinical studies, which, in turn, likely would have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nAll manufacturers of our clinical trial material and, as applicable, commercial product, including API manufacturers, must comply with cGMP requirements enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program and applicable requirements of foreign regulatory authorities. These requirements include quality control, quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturers of our clinical trial material may be unable to comply with these cGMP requirements and with other FDA, state and foreign regulatory requirements. While we or our representatives generally monitor and audit our manufacturers\u2019 systems, we have little control over their ongoing compliance with these regulations. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in fines and civil penalties, suspension of production, suspension or delay in product approval, product seizure or recall, or withdrawal of product approval.\nCurrently, we do not have alternative sources to backup our primary sources of clinical trial material. Identification of and discussions with other vendors may be protracted and/or unsuccessful. Therefore, if our primary sources become unable or unwilling to perform, we could experience protracted delays or interruptions in the supply of clinical trial material and, ultimately, product for commercial sale, which could materially and adversely affect our development programs, commercial activities, operating results and financial condition. In addition, the FDA may require that we have an alternate manufacturer of a drug product before approving it for marketing and sale in the U.S. and securing such alternate manufacturer before approval of an NDA could result in considerable additional time and cost prior to NDA approval.\nAny new manufacturer or supplier of finished drug product or its component materials, including API, would be required to qualify under applicable regulatory requirements and would need to have sufficient rights under applicable intellectual property laws to the method of manufacturing such product or ingredients. The FDA may require us to conduct additional clinical studies, collect stability data and provide additional information concerning any new supplier, or change in a validated manufacturing process, including scaling-up production, before we could distribute products from that manufacturer or supplier or revised process. For example, if we were to engage a third party other than our current CMOs to supply drug product for future clinical trial material or commercial product, the FDA may require us to conduct additional clinical and nonclinical studies to ensure comparability of the drug substance manufactured by our current CMOs to drug substance manufactured by the new supplier. In addition to the potential for such requirements to result in significant interruption to development and commercialization of our product candidates, we likely would incur substantial additional costs to comply with the additional requirements.\nThe manufacture of pharmaceutical products requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. Manufacturers of pharmaceutical products often encounter difficulties in production, particularly in scaling-up initial production. These problems include difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control, including stability of the product candidate and quality assurance testing, and shortages of qualified personnel. None of our product candidates has been manufactured at the scale we believe will be necessary to maximize its commercial value and, accordingly, we may encounter difficulties in attempting to scale-up production and may not succeed in that effort on a timely basis or at all, including as a result of delaying activities necessary to establish commercial-scale production due to capital constraints. In addition, the FDA or other regulatory authorities may impose additional requirements as we scale-up initial production capabilities, which may delay our scale-up activities or add expense.\nIf our manufacturers encounter any of these difficulties or otherwise fail to comply with their contractual obligations or we delay in entering into commercial supply agreements due to capital constraints, we may have insufficient quantities of material to support ongoing and/or planned clinical studies or to meet commercial demand, if approved. In addition, any delay or interruption in the supply of materials necessary or useful to manufacture our product candidates could delay the completion of our clinical studies, increase the costs associated with our development programs and, depending upon the period of delay, require us to commence new clinical studies at significant additional expense or terminate the studies completely. Delays or interruptions in the supply of commercial product could result in increased cost of goods sold and lost sales. We cannot provide assurance that manufacturing or quality control problems will not arise in connection with the manufacture of our clinical trial material or commercial product, if approved, or that third-party manufacturers will be able to maintain the necessary governmental licenses and approvals to continue manufacturing such clinical trial material or commercial product, as applicable. In addition, vepoloxamer currently is manufactured outside the U.S. and, as a result, we may experience interruptions in supply due to shipping or customs difficulties or regional instability. Any of the above factors could cause us to delay or suspend anticipated or ongoing trials, regulatory submissions or commercialization of our product candidates, entail higher costs or result in our being unable to effectively commercialize our products. Our dependence upon third parties for the manufacture of our clinical trial material may adversely affect our future costs and our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates on a timely and competitive basis.\nWe rely significantly on third parties to conduct our nonclinical testing and clinical studies and other aspects of our development programs and if those third parties do not satisfactorily perform their contractual obligations or meet anticipated deadlines, the development of our product candidates could be adversely affected.\nWe do not employ personnel or possess the facilities necessary to conduct many of the activities associated with our programs. We engage consultants, advisors, CROs, CMOs and others to assist in the design and conduct of nonclinical and clinical studies of our product candidates, with interpretation of the results of those studies and with regulatory activities, and we expect to continue to outsource a significant amount of such activities. As a result, many important aspects of our development programs are and will continue to be outside our direct control, and our third-party service providers may not perform as required or expected. Further, such third parties may not be as committed to the success of our programs as employees and, therefore, may not devote the same time, thoughtfulness or creativity to completing projects or problem-solving as would an employee. To the extent we are unable to successfully manage the performance of third-party service providers, our business may be adversely affected.\nThe CROs that we engage to execute our clinical studies play a significant role in the conduct of the studies, including the collection and analysis of study data, and we likely will depend on CROs and clinical investigators to conduct future clinical studies and to assist in analyzing data from completed studies and developing regulatory strategies for our product candidates. Individuals working at the CROs with which we contract, as well as investigators at the sites at which our studies are conducted, are not our employees, and we have limited control over the amount or timing of resources that they devote to our programs. As discussed above, with respect to our AIR001 program, because we are not the sponsor of the ongoing clinical studies of AIR001, our control over these studies is further limited. If our CROs, study investigators, and/or third-party sponsors fail to devote sufficient time and resources to studies of our product candidates, if they do not comply with all regulatory and contractual requirements, or if their performance is substandard, it may delay commencement and/or completion of these studies, submission of applications for regulatory approval, regulatory approval, and commercialization of our product candidates. Failure of CROs to meet their obligations to us could adversely affect development of our product candidates. For example, in 2006, we engaged a CRO to assist with the primary conduct of our bioequivalence study of Exelbine, including monitoring participating clinical sites to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. FDA guidance recommends that clinical sites randomly select and retain reserve samples of study drugs used in bioequivalence studies. However, the clinical sites that participated in our bioequivalence study of Exelbine failed to do so. In August 2011, we received a complete response letter from the FDA stating that the authenticity of the study drugs used in that bioequivalence study could not be verified and, consequently, the study would need to be repeated to address that deficiency.\nIn addition, CROs we engage may have relationships with other commercial entities, some of which may compete with us. If they assist our competitors at our expense, it could harm our competitive position. Moreover, if a CRO fails to perform during a clinical study, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs on acceptable terms or in a timely manner, or at all. Switching CROs may increase costs and divert management time and attention. In addition, there likely would be a transition period when a new CRO commences work. These challenges could result in delays in the commencement or completion of our clinical studies, which could materially impact our ability to meet our desired development timelines and have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nOur product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their clinical development, regulatory approval or commercialization.\nUndesirable side effects caused by our product candidates could interrupt, delay or halt clinical studies and could result in the denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for any or all indications, and in turn prevent us from commercializing our product candidates.\nIf any of our product candidates receive marketing approval and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by the product or, if applicable, the reference product:\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as a \u201cblack box\u201d warning or a contraindication;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to change the way the product is administered, conduct additional clinical studies or change the labeling of the product; and\n\u2022\nour reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product or could substantially increase the costs and expenses of commercializing the product, which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating significant revenue from its sale.\nWe may not achieve our projected development goals in the time frames we announce.\nWe set goals for and make public statements regarding our estimates of the timing for accomplishing certain objectives material to successful development of our product candidates. The actual timing of these events can vary, sometimes dramatically, due to many factors, including delays or failures in our nonclinical testing, clinical studies and manufacturing and regulatory activities and the uncertainties inherent in the regulatory approval process. From time to time we provide estimates for the completion of enrollment of or announcement of data from clinical studies of our product candidates. However, predicting the rate of enrollment or the time from completion of enrollment to announcement of data for any clinical study requires us to make a number of significant assumptions that may prove to be incorrect. In addition, for studies sponsored by independent third parties, we have even less control over whether the study meets anticipated timelines. If, as a clinical study progresses, we gain reliable information that materially impacts our assumptions, we will adjust our estimates. Even so, as discussed in other risk factors above, our estimated enrollment rates and the actual rates may differ materially and the time required to complete enrollment of any clinical study may be considerably longer than we estimate. In addition, even if we complete enrollment as expected, it may take longer than anticipated to prepare the data for review and then to review, analyze and announce the data, as was the case with our Phase 3 study of vepoloxamer in sickle cell disease. Such delays may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nEven if we complete a clinical study with successful results, we may not achieve our projected development goals in the time frames we initially anticipate or announce. If a development plan for a product candidate becomes more extensive and costly than anticipated, we may determine that the associated time and cost are not financially justifiable and, as a result, discontinue development in a particular indication or of the product candidate as a whole. Any such action may be viewed negatively, which could adversely affect our stock price.\nIn addition, changes may occur in regulatory requirements or policy during the period of product development and/or regulatory review of an NDA that relate to the data required to be included in NDAs. A change in regulatory policy that is not formalized or publicly announced may result in our submission of an NDA that the FDA or a foreign regulatory agency deems insufficient to support product approval, which could substantially increase the time and cost associated with seeking regulatory approval of a product candidate.\nThroughout development, we must provide adequate assurance to the FDA and other regulatory authorities that we can consistently produce our product candidates in conformance with cGMP and other regulatory standards. As discussed above, we rely on CMOs for the manufacture of clinical, and future commercial, quantities of our product candidates. If future FDA or other regulatory authority inspections identify cGMP compliance issues at these third-party facilities, production of our clinical trial material or, in the future, commercial product, could be disrupted, causing potentially substantial delay in development or commercialization of our product candidates.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval for a product candidate, we may face development and regulatory difficulties that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and cause our stock price to decline.\nEven if initial regulatory approval is obtained, or as a condition to the initial approval, the FDA or a foreign regulatory agency may impose significant restrictions on a product\u2019s indicated uses or marketing or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies or marketing surveillance programs, any of which would limit the commercial potential of the product. Our product candidates also will be subject to ongoing FDA requirements related to the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, promotion, record-keeping and submission of safety and other post-market information regarding the product. For instance, the FDA may require changes to approved drug labels, require post-approval clinical studies and impose distribution and use restrictions on certain drug products. In addition, approved products, manufacturers and manufacturers\u2019 facilities are subject to continuing regulatory review and periodic inspections. If previously unknown problems with a product are discovered, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, the FDA may impose restrictions on that product or us, including requiring withdrawal of the product from the market. If we or a CMO of ours fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may:\n\u2022\nissue warning letters or untitled letters;\n\u2022\nimpose civil or criminal penalties;\n\u2022\nsuspend or withdraw regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nsuspend or terminate any ongoing clinical studies;\n\u2022\nrefuse to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications;\n\u2022\nexclude our product from reimbursement under government healthcare programs, including Medicaid or Medicare;\n\u2022\nimpose restrictions or affirmative obligations on our or our CMO\u2019s operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements;\n\u2022\nclose the facilities of a CMO; or\n\u2022\nseize or detain products or require a product recall.\nIf any of our product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval fails to achieve significant market acceptance among the medical community, patients or third-party payors, the revenue we generate from its sales will be limited and our business may not be profitable.\nOur success will depend in substantial part on the extent to which our product candidates, if approved, are accepted by the medical community and patients and reimbursed by third-party payors, including government payors. The degree of market acceptance with respect to each of our approved products, if any, will depend upon a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe safety and efficacy of our product demonstrated in clinical studies;\n\u2022\nacceptance in the medical and patient communities of our product as a safe and effective treatment;\n\u2022\nthe perceived advantages of our product over alternative treatments, including with respect to the incidence and severity of any adverse side effects and the cost of treatment;\n\u2022\nthe indications for which our product is approved;\n\u2022\nclaims or other information (including limitations or warnings) in our product\u2019s approved labeling;\n\u2022\nreimbursement and coverage policies of government and other third-party payors;\n\u2022\npricing and cost-effectiveness of our product relative to alternative treatments;\n\u2022\navailability of alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nthe prevalence of off-label substitution of chemically equivalent products or alternative treatments; and\n\u2022\nthe resources we devote to marketing our product and restrictions on promotional claims we can make with respect to the product.\nWe cannot predict with reasonable accuracy whether physicians, patients, healthcare insurers or health maintenance organizations, or the medical community in general, will accept or utilize any of our products. If our product candidates are approved but do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by these parties, we may not generate sufficient revenue to become or remain profitable. In addition, our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors regarding benefits of our products may require significant resources and may never be successful.\nIf we determine that a product candidate may not achieve adequate market acceptance or that the potential market size does not justify additional expenditure on the program, we may reduce our expenditures on the development and/or the process of seeking regulatory approval of the product candidate while we evaluate whether and on what timeline to move the program forward.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval to market one or more of our product candidates in the U.S., we may never receive approval or commercialize our products outside of the U.S., which would limit our ability to realize the full commercial potential of our product candidates.\nIn order to market any products outside of the U.S., we must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy. Approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and validation and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process in other countries may include all of the risks\ndetailed above regarding FDA approval in the U.S., as well as other risks. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory process in others. Failure to obtain regulatory approval in other countries or any delay or setback in obtaining such approval could have the same adverse effects detailed above regarding FDA approval in the U.S. As described above, such effects include the risks that our product candidates may not be approved for all indications requested, which could limit the uses of our product candidates and have an adverse effect on product sales, and that such approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or require costly, post-marketing follow-up studies.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nOur success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining effective patent and other intellectual property protection for our product candidates and proprietary technology.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to:\n\u2022\nobtain and maintain patent and other exclusivity with respect to our products and their use;\n\u2022\nprevent third parties from infringing upon our proprietary rights;\n\u2022\nmaintain proprietary know-how and trade secrets;\n\u2022\noperate without infringing upon the patents and proprietary rights of others; and\n\u2022\nobtain appropriate licenses to patents or proprietary rights held by third parties if infringement would otherwise occur or if necessary to secure exclusive rights to them, both in the U.S. and in foreign countries.\nThe patent and intellectual property positions of biopharmaceutical companies generally are highly uncertain, involve complex legal and factual questions, and have been and continue to be the subject of much litigation. There is no guarantee that we have or will develop or obtain the rights to products or processes that are patentable, that patents will issue from any pending applications or that claims allowed will be sufficient to protect the technology we develop or have developed or that is used by us, our CMOs or our other service providers. In addition, any patents that are issued to us may be limited in scope or challenged, invalidated, infringed or circumvented, including by our competitors, and rights we have under issued patents may not provide competitive advantages to us. If competitors can develop and commercialize technology and products similar to ours, our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be impaired.\nPatent applications in the U.S. are confidential for a period of time until they are published, and publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature typically lags actual discoveries by several months. As a result, we cannot be certain that the inventors listed in any patent or patent application owned by us were the first to conceive of the inventions covered by such patents and patent applications (for U.S. patent applications filed before March 16, 2013), or that such inventors were the first to file patent applications for such inventions outside the United States and, after March 15, 2013, in the United States. In addition, changes in or different interpretations of patent laws in the United States and foreign countries may affect our patent rights and limit the number of patents we can obtain, which could permit others to use our discoveries or to develop and commercialize our technology and products without any compensation to us.\nWe also rely on unpatented know-how and trade secrets and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position, which we seek to protect, in part, through confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, collaborators and others. We also have invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and certain consultants. The steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights, however, may not be adequate to preclude misappropriation of or otherwise protect our proprietary information or prevent infringement of our intellectual property rights, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such misappropriation or infringement. In addition, it is possible that inventions relevant to our business could be developed by a person not bound by an invention assignment agreement with us or independently discovered by a competitor.\nWe also intend to rely on regulatory exclusivity for protection of our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale. Implementation and enforcement of regulatory exclusivity, which may consist of regulatory data protection and market protection, varies widely from country to country. Failure to qualify for regulatory exclusivity, or failure to obtain or maintain the extent or duration of such protections that we expect for our product candidates, if approved, could affect our decision on whether to market the products in a particular country or countries or could otherwise have an adverse impact on our revenue or our results of operations. For AIR001, which is administered via nebulization, we may rely on regulatory exclusivity for the combination of AIR001 and its delivery system. Other medications that alter pulmonary pressures include the delivery device in their U.S. and European market\nlabels, and are approved for use only with the specified proprietary delivery device. However, there is no assurance that our AIR001 product and its delivery system, if approved, will benefit from this type of market protection.\nWe may rely on trademarks, trade names and brand names to distinguish our products, if approved for commercial sale, from the products of our competitors. However, our trademark applications may not be approved. Third parties may also oppose our trademark applications or otherwise challenge our use of the trademarks in which case we may expend substantial resources to defend our trademarks and may enter into agreements with third parties that may limit our use of our trademarks. In the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our product, which could result in loss of brand recognition and could require us to devote significant resources to advertising and marketing these new brands. Further, our competitors may infringe our trademarks or we may not have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to prevent competitors from duplicating or developing and commercializing equivalent versions of our product candidates, but patent protection may be difficult to obtain and any issued claims may be limited.\nThe potential use and therapeutic benefits of inorganic nitrite, such as sodium nitrite (the API in AIR001) have been known for decades. There is substantial prior art describing the uses of inorganic nitrite in a wide range of diseases and conditions. As a result, our ability to find novel and non-obvious uses of AIR001 is uncertain. Further, a patent examiner may combine numerous, disparate references in order to reject a claimed composition, formulation and/or use for obviousness. If the prior art suggests, even implicitly, the desirability of combining previously known elements, such as the use of AIR001 in a particular indication, the subsequent use of AIR001 in that indication may be unpatentable.\nWe have filed for patent protection in the U.S. and other countries to cover various methods of therapeutic use of our product candidates, including the use of inhaled inorganic nitrite for treating HFpEF. However, our pending patent applications may not issue as patents, and any issued patents may not provide us with significant competitive advantages, because the validity or enforceability of any of those patents may be challenged and, if instituted, one or more of the challenges may be successful. Patents may be challenged in the U.S. under post-grant review proceedings, inter partes reexamination, ex parte re-examination, or challenges in district court. Any patents issued in foreign jurisdictions may be subjected to comparable proceedings lodged in various foreign patent offices. These proceedings could result in either loss of the patent or loss or reduction in the scope of one or more of the claims of the patent. Even if a patent issues, and is held valid and enforceable, competitors may be able to design around our patents, such as by using pre-existing or newly developed technology, in which case competitors may not infringe our issued claims and may be able to market and sell products that compete directly with ours before our patents expire. In addition, our pending patent applications to cover use of AIR001 for treating HFpEF are jointly owned with an independent research and educational institution and until and unless we obtain an exclusive license to that co-owner\u2019s rights, it may license its rights to another third-party, which could negatively affect the value of our product candidate.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming. We and any future licensors and licensees may not apply for or prosecute patents on certain aspects of our product candidates at a reasonable cost, in a timely fashion, or at all. We may not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of some patent applications related to our product candidates or technologies. As a result, these patents and patent applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our company. It is also possible that we or any future licensors or licensees will fail to identify patentable aspects of inventions made in the course of development and commercialization activities before it is too late to obtain patent protection on them. Further, it is possible that defects of form in the preparation or filing of our patent applications may exist, or may arise in the future, such as with respect to proper priority claims, inventorship, assignment, or claim scope. If there are material defects in the form or preparation of our patents or patent applications, such patents or applications may be invalid or unenforceable. In addition, one or more parties may independently develop similar technologies or methods, duplicate our technologies or methods, or design around the patented aspects of our products, technologies or methods. Any of these circumstances could impair our ability to protect our products, if approved, in ways which may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nFurthermore, the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in and outside of the United States. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or freedom to operate or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical products or technology, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and drugs. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new drug candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing drugs similar or identical to ours.\nEnforcement of intellectual property rights in countries outside the U.S., including China in particular, has been limited or non-existent. Future enforcement of patents and proprietary rights in many other countries will likely be problematic or unpredictable.\nMoreover, the issuance of a patent in one country does not assure the issuance of a similar patent in another country. Claim interpretation and infringement laws vary by nation, so the extent of any patent protection is uncertain and may vary in different jurisdictions.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and applications are required to be paid to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, and various governmental patent agencies outside of the U.S. in several stages over the lifetime of the patents and applications. The USPTO and various non-U.S. governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process and after a patent has issued. There are situations in which non-compliance can result in decreased patent term adjustment or in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, leading to partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction.\nThird parties may claim that our products, if approved, infringe on their proprietary rights and may challenge the approved use or uses of a product or our patents rights through litigation or administrative proceedings, and defending such actions may be costly and time consuming, divert management attention away from our business, and result in an unfavorable outcome that could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur commercial success depends on our ability and the ability of our CMOs and component suppliers to develop, manufacture, market and sell our products and product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are or may be developing products. As the industries in which we operate (biopharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical, biotechnology and pharmaceutical) expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that we will be subject to claims that our products or product candidates, or their use or manufacture, infringe the rights of others. Because patent applications can take many years to publish and issue, there currently may be pending applications, unknown to us, that may later result in issued patents that our products, product candidates or technologies infringe, or that the process of manufacturing our products or any of their respective component materials, or the component materials themselves, infringe, or that the use of our products, product candidates or technologies infringe.\nWe or our CMOs or component material suppliers may be exposed to, or threatened with, litigation by third parties alleging that our products, product candidates and/or technologies infringe their patents and/or other intellectual property rights, or that one or more of the processes for manufacturing our products or any of their respective component materials, or the component materials themselves, or the use of our products, product candidates or technologies, infringe their patents and/or other intellectual property rights. If a third-party patent or other intellectual property right is found to cover our products, product candidates, technologies or their uses, or any of the underlying manufacturing processes or components, we could be required to pay damages and could be unable to commercialize our products or use our technologies or methods unless we are able to obtain a license to the patent or intellectual property right. A license may not be available to us in a timely manner or on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, during litigation, the third-party alleging infringement could obtain a preliminary injunction or other equitable remedy that could prohibit us from making, using, selling or importing our products, technologies or methods.\nThere generally is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the industries in which we operate and the cost of such litigation may be considerable. We can provide no assurance that our product candidates or technologies will not infringe patents or rights owned by others, licenses to which might not be available to us in a timely manner or on acceptable terms, or at all. If a third party claims that we or our CMOs or component material suppliers infringe its intellectual property rights, we may face a number of issues, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\ninfringement and other intellectual property claims which, with or without merit, may be expensive and time consuming to litigate and may divert our management\u2019s time and attention from our core business;\n\u2022\nsubstantial damages for infringement, including the potential for treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees, which we may have to pay if it is determined that the product and/or its use at issue infringes or violates the third party\u2019s rights;\n\u2022\na court prohibiting us from selling or licensing the product unless the third-party licenses its intellectual property rights to us, which it may not be required to do;\n\u2022\nif a license is available from the third party, we may have to pay substantial royalties, fees and/or grant cross-licenses to the third party; and\n\u2022\nredesigning our products or processes so they do not infringe, which may not be possible or may require substantial expense and time.\nNo assurance can be given that patents do not exist, have not been filed, or could not be filed or issued, which contain claims covering our products, product candidates or technology or those of our CMOs or component material suppliers or the use of our products, product candidates or technologies. Because of the large number of patents issued and patent applications filed in the industries in which we operate, there is a risk that third parties may allege they have patent rights encompassing our products, product candidates or technologies, or those of our CMOs or component material suppliers, or uses of our products, product candidates or technologies. With regard to AIR001, we are aware of issued patents and pending patent applications with claims related to compositions of sodium nitrite and therapeutic uses of sodium nitrite and/or inorganic nitrite. We do not believe that use of inhaled AIR001 to treat HFpEF, if approved, would infringe on issued patents. However, if AIR001 is approved for commercial sale, the third-party owners of patents issued currently or in the future may allege that our product infringes on their patents, in which case we may become involved in costly and time consuming litigation and/or administrative proceedings to defend the manufacture and/or use of our product, or we may agree to pay substantial amounts to obtain licenses from such parties, which could negatively affect our business prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nIn the future, it may be necessary for us to enforce our proprietary rights, or to determine the scope, validity and unenforceability of other parties\u2019 proprietary rights, through litigation or other dispute proceedings, which may be costly, and to the extent we are unsuccessful, adversely affect our rights. In these proceedings, a court or administrative body could determine that our claims, including those related to enforcing patent rights, are not valid or that an alleged infringer has not infringed our rights. The uncertainty resulting from the mere institution and continuation of any patent- or other proprietary rights-related litigation or interference proceeding could have a material and adverse effect on our business prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY\nWe expect intense competition in the marketplace for our product candidates, should any of them receive regulatory approval.\nThe industries in which we operate (biopharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical, biotechnology and pharmaceutical) are highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant change. We are aware of many other organizations developing drug products and other therapies intended to treat or cure the diseases or conditions in which we are developing or plan to develop our product candidates. Developments by others may render potential application of any of our product candidates in a particular indication obsolete or noncompetitive, even prior to completion of its development and approval for that indication. If successfully developed and approved, we expect our product candidates will face intense competition. We may not be able to compete successfully against organizations with competitive products, particularly large pharmaceutical companies. Many of our potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources than we do, and may be better equipped to develop, manufacture, market and distribute products. Many of these companies operate large, well-funded research, development and commercialization programs, have extensive experience in nonclinical and clinical studies, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals and manufacturing and marketing products, and have multiple products that have been approved or are in late-stage development. Smaller companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Furthermore, heightened awareness on the part of academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations of the potential commercial value of their inventions have led them to actively seek to commercialize the technologies they develop, which increases competition for investment in our programs. Competitive products may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than ours, which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue.\nWe are subject to uncertainty relating to healthcare reform measures and reimbursement policies that, if not favorable to our products, could hinder or prevent our products\u2019 commercial success, if any of our product candidates are approved.\nThe unavailability or inadequacy of third-party payor coverage and reimbursement could negatively affect the market acceptance of our product candidates and the future revenues we may expect to receive from those products. The commercial success of our product candidates, if approved, will depend in part on the extent to which the costs of such products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and other organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, even if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis. In the case of products administered in an inpatient hospital setting, a level of payment that is inadequate to cover the cost to hospitals of providing and administering our products to patients, could delay market acceptance of or limit our ability to penetrate the markets for our products.\nSignificant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status for newly approved drug products, including coding, coverage and payment. There is no uniform policy requirement for coverage and reimbursement for drug products among third-party payors in the United States, therefore coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. The coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate payment will be applied consistently or obtained. The process for determining whether a payor will cover and how much it will reimburse a product may be separate from the process of seeking approval of the product or for setting the price of the product. Even if reimbursement is provided, market acceptance of our products may be adversely affected if the amount of payment for our products proves to be unprofitable for healthcare providers or less profitable than alternative treatments or if administrative burdens make our products less desirable to use. Third-party payor reimbursement to providers of our products, if approved, may be subject to a bundled payment that also includes the procedure of administering our products. To the extent there is no separate payment for our product(s), there may be further uncertainty as to the adequacy of reimbursement amounts.\nThe continuing efforts of the government, private insurance companies, and other organizations to contain or reduce costs of healthcare may adversely affect:\n\u2022\nour ability to set an appropriate price for our products;\n\u2022\nthe rate and scope of adoption of our products by healthcare providers;\n\u2022\nour ability to generate revenue or achieve or maintain profitability;\n\u2022\nthe future revenue and profitability of our potential customers, suppliers and collaborators; and\n\u2022\nour access to additional capital.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize our products will depend in part on the extent to which governmental authorities, private health insurers and other organizations establish what we believe are appropriate coverage and reimbursement for our products. The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments and the prices of drug products have been a focus in this effort. For example, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. We expect that federal, state and local governments in the U.S. will continue to consider legislation directed at lowering the total cost of healthcare. In addition, in certain foreign markets, the pricing of drug products is subject to government control and reimbursement may in some cases be unavailable or insufficient. It is uncertain whether and how future legislation, whether domestic or abroad, could affect prospects for our product candidates or what actions federal, state, or private payors for healthcare treatment and services may take in response to any such healthcare reform proposals or legislation. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures reforms may prevent or limit our ability to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our product candidates.\nWe face potential product liability exposure and, if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability for a product or product candidate and may have to limit its commercialization. In the future, we anticipate that we will need to obtain additional or increased product liability insurance coverage and it is uncertain whether such increased or additional insurance coverage can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nOur business (in particular, the use of our product candidates in clinical studies and the sale of any products for which we obtain marketing approval) will expose us to product liability risks. Product liability claims might be brought against us by patients, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling our products. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against any such claims, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for our products and loss of revenue;\n\u2022\nimpairment of our business reputation;\n\u2022\ndelays in enrolling patients to participate in our clinical studies;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical study participants;\n\u2022\na \u201cclinical hold,\u201d suspension or termination of a clinical study or amendments to a study design;\n\u2022\nsignificant costs of related litigation;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants; and\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize our products and product candidates.\nWe maintain limited product liability insurance for our clinical studies, but our insurance coverage may not reimburse us or may not be sufficient to reimburse us for all expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses.\nWe expect that we will expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products if we obtain marketing approval of any of our product candidates, but we may be unable to obtain product liability insurance on commercially acceptable terms or may not be able to maintain such insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against potential losses. Large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drug products that had unanticipated side effects. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to fall and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and adversely affect our business.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nIf we are unable to maintain compliance with NYSE MKT continued listing standards and policies, the NYSE MKT may commence proceedings to delist our common stock, and in some cases, determine to suspend trading in our common stock immediately without an opportunity to propose a plan that could enable us to regain compliance, which would likely cause the liquidity and market price of our common stock to decline and you could lose your investment.\nOur common stock is listed on the NYSE MKT (\u201cNYSE MKT\u201d or the \u201cExchange\u201d). The NYSE MKT retains substantial discretion to, at any time and without notice, suspend dealings in or remove from any security from listing. The NYSE MKT has adopted continued listing standards related to an issuer\u2019s financial condition, operating results, disposal of assets, reduction in operations, compliance with listing agreements and SEC requirements, and the extent of public distribution and market value of the issuer\u2019s listed security, and the Exchange will consider suspending dealings in, or delisting, securities of an issuer that does not meet those standards. For example, the NYSE MKT will consider suspending dealings in, or delisting, securities of an issuer that has stockholders\u2019 equity of less than $6 million if that issuer has sustained losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in its five most recent fiscal years. We have had a loss from operations and net loss in each of our five most recent fiscal years. As of December 31, 2016, our stockholders\u2019 equity was $9.8 million. If our stockholders\u2019 equity falls below $6 million, the Exchange may determine that we are no longer suitable for listing and may commence delisting proceedings pursuant Section 1003(a)(iii) of the NYSE MKT Company Guide.\nThe NYSE MKT will also normally consider suspending dealings in, or removing from the list, a common stock selling for a substantial period of time at a low price per share if the issuer fails to effect a reverse split of the stock within a reasonable time after being notified that the Exchange deems such action to be appropriate under the circumstances. We understand NYSE MKT policy to be that, if the 30-day average closing price of an issuer\u2019s common stock is less than $0.20 per share, the Exchange will alert the issuer to the fact that it may have a low selling price deficiency if, in six months, the 30-day average closing price of the issuer\u2019s common stock is still, or again, less than $0.20 per share. If, in six months, the 30-day average closing price of the issuer\u2019s common stock is in fact less than $0.20 per share, the issuer should expect to receive a deficiency letter from the Exchange notifying the issuer that it is below the continued listing criteria set forth in Section 1003(f)(v) of the NYSE MKT Company Guide and the issuer would have to submit a plan to the Exchange to regain compliance with its listing standards, have that plan accepted by the Exchange, and subsequently perform against that plan, otherwise the Exchange would commence delisting proceedings. The market price for our common stock historically has been highly volatile, and we expect it will continue to be highly volatile in the foreseeable future. If the 30-day average closing price of our common stock falls below $0.20 per share, we may, in six months from that time, be considered by the Exchange to be out of compliance with Section 1003(f)(v) of the NYSE MKT Company Guide and the Exchange may require us to effect a reverse split of our common stock within a reasonable time to regain compliance or otherwise commence delisting proceedings.\nIn addition, we are aware of a NYSE MKT policy that, if an issuer\u2019s common stock trades below $0.06 per share, the staff of the Exchange will determine that issuer\u2019s stock is no longer suitable for listing on the NYSE MKT and will halt trading in and commence proceedings to delist that stock from the Exchange immediately. The issuer may appeal the delisting, but the issuer\u2019s stock will continue to be suspended from trading on the Exchange during the appeal process and the appeal may be unsuccessful.\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to maintain compliance with NYSE MKT continued listing standards and/or policies. The delisting of our common stock from the NYSE MKT likely would reduce the trading volume and liquidity in our\ncommon stock, may lead to decreases in the trading price of our common stock, and may also materially impair our stockholders\u2019 ability to buy and sell shares. In addition, the delisting of our common stock could significantly impair our ability to raise additional capital, which may be necessary for to execute on our business strategy.\nIf our common stock were delisted and determined to be a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d a broker-dealer may find it more difficult to trade our common stock and an investor may find it more difficult to acquire or dispose of our common stock in the secondary market.\nIf our common stock was removed from listing with the NYSE MKT, it may be subject to the so-called \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules. The SEC has adopted regulations that define a \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price per share of less than $5.00, subject to certain exceptions, such as any securities listed on a national securities exchange. For any transaction involving a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d unless exempt, the rules impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers, subject to certain exceptions. If our common stock were delisted and determined to be a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d a broker-dealer may find it more difficult to trade our common stock and an investor may find it more difficult to acquire or dispose of our common stock on the secondary market.\nThe market price of our common stock historically has been and likely will continue to be highly volatile.\nThe market price for our common stock historically has been highly volatile, and the market for our common stock has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations, based both on our operating performance and for reasons that appear to us unrelated to our operating performance. For instance, based on closing prices, the market price for our common stock dropped approximately 45% following our announcement of an underwritten public offering of equity securities on February 9, 2016, and it dropped approximately 80% following our announcement of top-line results of our Phase 3 clinical study of vepoloxamer in sickle cell disease on September 20, 2016. Conversely, the market price for our common stock increased by more than 55% during one trading day in January 2014, in the absence of any news release by us or rumors of which we were aware. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe level of our financial resources;\n\u2022\nannouncements of entry into or consummation of a financing or strategic transaction;\n\u2022\nresults from a clinical study of a product candidate;\n\u2022\ndelays in the completion of our clinical studies or termination of a clinical study, including due to difficulties with patient enrollment or safety issues or inability to produce sufficient quantities of clinical trial material;\n\u2022\nFDA or international regulatory actions and regulatory developments in the U.S. and foreign countries;\n\u2022\nannouncements of new products or technologies, commercial relationships or other events (including clinical study results and regulatory events and actions) by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements of difficulties or delays in commercial manufacture or supply of our drug products;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions in the pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors;\n\u2022\ndevelopments concerning intellectual property rights generally or those of us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial performance or deviations in our business and the trading price of our common stock from the estimates of securities analysts;\n\u2022\nevents affecting any future collaborations, commercial agreements and grants;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in stock market prices and trading volumes of similar companies;\n\u2022\nsales of large blocks of our common stock, including sales by significant stockholders, our executive officers or our directors or pursuant to shelf or resale registration statements that register shares of our common stock that may be sold by us or certain of our current or future stockholders;\n\u2022\ndiscussion of us or our stock price by the financial and scientific press and in online investor communities;\n\u2022\ncommencement of delisting proceedings by the NYSE MKT;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel; and\n\u2022\nchanges in third-party payor coverage or reimbursement policies.\nAs evidenced by the September 2016 decline, the realization of any of the foregoing could have a dramatic and adverse impact on the market price of our common stock. In addition, class action litigation has often been instituted against companies whose securities have experienced a substantial decline in market price. Moreover, regulatory entities often undertake investigations of investor transactions in securities that experience volatility following an announcement of a significant event or condition. Any such litigation brought against us or any such investigation involving our investors could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur stock price could decline significantly based on progress with and results of our clinical studies and regulatory agency decisions affecting development of our product candidates.\nWe expect announcements of progress with and results of clinical studies of our product candidates and regulatory decisions (by us, the FDA, or another regulatory agency) to affect our stock price. Stock prices of companies in our industry have declined significantly when such results and decisions were unfavorable or perceived to be negative or discouraging or when a product candidate did not otherwise meet expectations, and, as discussed above, the price of our common stock dropped significantly following our September 20, 2016 announcement that our Phase 3 clinical study of vepoloxamer in sickle cell disease did not meet the primary efficacy endpoint. If progress in clinical studies or study results are not viewed favorably by us or third parties, including investors, analysts, potential collaborators, the academic and medical communities and regulators, our stock price could decline significantly and you could lose your investment in our common stock.\nWe may report top-line or interim clinical and nonclinical study data from time to time, which is based on preliminary analysis of then-available data. Such preliminary findings and conclusions are subject to change following a more comprehensive review of the study data and, in the case of interim data, completion of the study. In addition, results of clinical and nonclinical studies often are subject to different interpretations. We may interpret or weigh the importance of study data differently than third parties, including those noted above. Others may not accept or agree with our analysis of study data, which could impact the approvability of our product candidates and/or the value of our development programs and our company in general.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock or the perception that such sales may occur could cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly, even if our business is performing well.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales by, or the perceived possibility of sales by, us or our existing stockholders of shares of our common stock. Sales by our existing stockholders might also make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities at a time and price that we deem appropriate. Under our existing ATM program, as of December 31, 2016, we may sell up to approximately $18.0 million of additional shares of our common stock. The shelf registration statement on Form S-3 under which the ATM program is registered may be used to register the sale and issuance of more than $99 million of additional securities, subject to limitations if our public float is less than $75 million. In addition, as of March 2, 2017, we have outstanding warrants to purchase approximately 81 million additional shares of our common stock. All of those warrants have an exercise price of less than $1.00 per share; however, based on the closing price of our common stock on March 2, 2017, no outstanding warrants are in-the-money. Collectively, the ATM program, the shelf registration statement and any in-the-money warrants, may increase the likelihood of sales of substantial amounts of our shares, or the perception that substantial sales may occur, by us or our existing securityholders from time to time, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law may make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult, which could depress our stock price.\nWe are incorporated in Delaware. Certain anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law and our charter documents as currently in effect may make a change in control of our company more difficult, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders. Our bylaws limit who may call a special meeting of stockholders and establish advance notice requirements for nomination of individuals for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholders\u2019 meetings. Delaware law also prohibits corporations from engaging in a business combination with any holders of 15% or more of their capital stock until the holder has held the stock for three years unless, among other possibilities, the board of directors approves the transaction. Our board of directors may use these provisions to prevent changes in the management and control of our company. Also, under applicable Delaware law, our board of directors may adopt additional anti-takeover measures in the future. In addition, provisions of certain compensatory contracts with our management, such as equity award agreements, may have an anti-takeover effect by resulting in accelerated vesting of outstanding equity securities held by our executive officers.\nBecause we do not expect to pay dividends with respect to our common stock in the foreseeable future, you must rely on stock appreciation for any return on your investment.\nWe have paid no cash dividends on any of our common stock to date, and we currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, with respect to our common stock, we do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future, and payment of cash dividends, if any, will also depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and other factors and will be at the discretion of our board of directors. Furthermore, we are subject to various laws and regulations that may restrict our ability to pay dividends and we may in the future become subject to contractual restrictions on, or prohibitions against, the payment of dividends. Currently, our debt facility with Hercules prohibits us from declaring and paying any cash dividend on any class of stock or other equity interest. Due to our intent to retain any future earnings rather than pay cash dividends on our common stock and applicable laws, regulations and contractual obligations that may restrict our ability to pay dividends on our common stock, the success of your investment in our common stock will likely depend entirely upon any future appreciation and our common stock may not appreciate.\nIf we were to issue shares of our common stock or preferred stock that are available for issuance, our stock price could decline.\nWe have 500,000,000 shares of authorized common stock and, as of March 2, 2017, approximately 115 million of such authorized shares were not outstanding or reserved for issuance under outstanding warrants, options, equity incentive plans or other rights. Subject to applicable securities laws and stock exchange listing requirements, our board of directors is authorized under our charter documents to sell and issue our authorized, but unissued, common stock without stockholder approval and may do so to satisfy our capital requirements or finance the expansion of our product pipeline. Our board of directors also is authorized to issue and sell up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval, at a purchase price approved by the board. The preferred stock may have rights that are superior to the rights of the holders of our common stock. The sale or the proposed sale of substantial amounts of our common stock, preferred stock and/or securities convertible into shares of our common or preferred stock in the public markets may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Our stockholders may also experience substantial dilution.", "PERMNO": 90101, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "SVRA"}
