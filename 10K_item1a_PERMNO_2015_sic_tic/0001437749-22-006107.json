{"cik": "741516", "company": "AMERICAN NATIONAL BANKSHARES INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-14", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nCREDIT RISK\nThe Company's credit standards and its on-going credit assessment processes might not protect it from significant credit losses.\nThe Company takes credit risk by virtue of making loans and extending loan commitments and letters of credit. The Company manages credit risk through a program of underwriting standards, the review of certain credit decisions and an on-going process of assessment of the quality of the credit already extended. The Company's exposure to credit risk is managed through the use of consistent underwriting standards that emphasize local lending while avoiding highly leveraged transactions as well as excessive industry and other concentrations. The Company's credit administration function employs risk management techniques to help ensure that problem loans are promptly identified. While these procedures are designed to provide the Company with the information needed to implement policy adjustments where necessary and to take appropriate corrective actions, and have proven to be reasonably effective to date, there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective in avoiding future undue credit risk.\nThe Company's focus on lending to small to mid-sized community-based businesses may increase its credit risk.\nMost of the Company's commercial business and commercial real estate loans are made to small business or middle market customers. These businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities and have a heightened vulnerability to economic conditions. Additionally, these loans may increase concentration risk as to industry or collateral securing the loans. If general economic conditions in the market areas in which the Company operates negatively impact this important customer sector, the Company's results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. Moreover, a portion of these loans have been made by the Company in recent years, and the borrowers may not have experienced a complete business or economic cycle. The deterioration of the borrowers' businesses may hinder their ability to repay their loans with the Company, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company depends on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties, and its financial condition could be adversely affected if it relies on misleading information.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or to enter into other transactions with clients and counterparties, the Company may rely on information furnished to it by or on behalf of clients and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information, which the Company does not independently verify. The Company also may rely on representations of clients and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. For example, in deciding whether to extend credit to clients, the Company may assume that a customer's audited financial statements conform with GAAP and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the customer. The Company's financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted to the extent it relies on financial statements that do not comply with GAAP or are materially misleading.\nThe allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses.\nIn accordance with GAAP, an allowance for loan losses is maintained by the Company to provide for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual credit losses, and future provisions for credit losses could materially and adversely affect operating results. The allowance for loan losses is based on prior experience, as well as an evaluation of the risks in the current portfolio. The amount of future losses is susceptible to changes in economic, operating, and other outside forces and conditions, including changes in interest rates, all of which are beyond the Company's control; and these losses may exceed current estimates. Federal bank regulatory agencies, as a part of their examination process, review the Company's loans and allowance for loan losses. While management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover current losses, it cannot make assurances that it will not further increase the allowance for loan losses or that regulators will not require it to increase this allowance. Either of these occurrences could adversely affect earnings.\nIn addition, the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2016-13, as amended, could result in a change in the amount of the allowance for loan losses as a result of changing from an \"incurred loss\" model, which encompasses allowances for current known and inherent losses within the portfolio, to an \"expected loss\" model, which encompasses allowances for losses expected to be incurred over the life of the portfolio. As a smaller reporting company at the one-time evaluation date, the Company has elected to defer adoption of ASU 2016-13 until January 2023. Refer to Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.\nNonperforming assets take significant time to resolve and adversely affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company's nonperforming assets adversely affect its net income in various ways. The Company does not record interest income on nonaccrual loans, which adversely affects its income and increases credit administration costs. When the Company receives collateral through foreclosures and similar proceedings, it is required to mark the related asset to the then fair market value of the collateral less estimated selling costs, which may, and often does, result in a loss. An increase in the level of nonperforming assets also increases the Company's risk profile and may impact the capital levels regulators believe are appropriate in light of such risks. The Company utilizes various techniques such as workouts, restructurings, and loan sales to manage problem assets. Increases in or negative adjustments in the value of these problem assets, the underlying collateral, or in the borrowers' performance or financial condition, could adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the resolution of nonperforming assets requires significant commitments of time from management and staff, which can be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities, including generation of new loans. There can be no assurance that the Company will avoid increases in nonperforming loans in the future.\nA downturn in the local real estate market could materially and negatively affect the Company's business.\nThe Company offers a variety of secured loans, including commercial lines of credit, commercial term loans, real estate, construction, home equity lines of credit, consumer and other loans. Many of these loans are secured by real estate (both residential and commercial) located in the Company's market area. A downturn in the real estate market in the areas in which the Company conducts its operations could negatively affect the Company's business because significant portions of its loans are secured by real estate. At December 31, 2021, the Company had approximately $1.9 billion in loans, of which approximately $1.6 billion (84.2%) were secured by real estate. The ability to recover on defaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral could then be diminished and the Company would be more likely to suffer losses.\nSubstantially all of the Company's real property collateral is located in its market area. If there is a decline in real estate values, especially in the Company's market area, the collateral for loans would deteriorate and provide significantly less security.\nThe Company relies upon independent appraisals to determine the value of the real estate which secures a significant portion of its loans, and the values indicated by such appraisals may not be realizable if the Company is forced to foreclose upon such loans.\nA significant portion of the Company's loan portfolio consists of loans secured by real estate. The Company relies upon independent appraisers to estimate the value of such real estate. Appraisals are only estimates of value and the independent appraisers may make mistakes of fact or judgment which adversely affect the reliability of their appraisals. In addition, events occurring after the initial appraisal may cause the value of the real estate to increase or decrease. As a result of any of these factors, the real estate securing some of the Company's loans may be more or less valuable than anticipated at the time the loans were made. If a default occurs on a loan secured by real estate that is less valuable than originally estimated, the Company may not be able to recover the outstanding balance of the loan and will suffer a loss.\nMARKET RISK\nThe Company's business is subject to interest rate risk, and variations in interest rates and inadequate management of interest rate risk may negatively affect financial performance.\nChanges in the interest rate environment may reduce the Company's profits. It is expected that the Company will continue to realize income from the spread between the interest earned on loans, securities, and other interest earning assets, and interest paid on deposits, borrowings and other interest bearing liabilities. Net interest spreads are affected by the difference between the maturities and repricing characteristics of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. In addition, loan volume and yields are affected by market interest rates on loans, and the current interest rate environment encourages extreme competition for new loan originations from qualified borrowers. Management cannot ensure that it can minimize the Company's interest rate risk.\nIf the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, the Company's net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. Any substantial, unexpected, or prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nThe expected replacement or discontinuation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") as a benchmark interest rate and a transition to an alternative reference interest rate could present operational problems and result in market disruption.\nThe administrator of LIBOR has announced its intention to extend the publication of most tenors of LIBOR for U.S. dollars through June 30, 2023 and ceased publishing other LIBOR tenors on December 31, 2021. Management cannot predict whether or when LIBOR will actually cease to be available, whether the Secured Overnight Funding Rate (\"SOFR\"), will become the market benchmark in its place or what impact such a transition may have on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe FRB, based on the recommendations of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\u2019s Alternative Reference Rate Committee, has begun publishing SOFR, which is intended to replace LIBOR, and has encouraged banks to transition away from LIBOR as soon as practicable. Although SOFR appears to be the preferred replacement rate for LIBOR, it is unclear if other benchmarks may emerge or if other rates will be adopted outside of the United States. The replacement of LIBOR also may result in economic mismatches between different categories of instruments that now consistently rely on the LIBOR benchmark. Markets are slowly developing in response to these new rates, and questions around liquidity in these rates and how to appropriately adjust these rates to eliminate any economic value transfer at the time of transition remain a significant concern.\nThe Company has an insignificant number of loans, borrowings and other financial instruments with attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR. Since proposed alternative rates are calculated differently, payments under contracts referencing new rates will differ from those referencing LIBOR. The transition should not change the Company's market risk profiles but will require changes to risk and pricing models, valuation tools, product design and hedging strategies. Furthermore, failure to adequately manage this transition process with customers could adversely impact the Company's reputation. Although the Company is currently unable to assess what the ultimate impact of the transition from LIBOR will be, failure to adequately manage the transition could have an adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLIQUIDITY RISK\nThe Company may need to raise additional capital in the future to continue to grow, but may be unable to obtain additional capital on favorable terms or at all.\nFederal and state banking regulators and safe and sound banking practices require the Company to maintain adequate levels of capital to support its operations. The Company's business strategy calls for it to continue to grow in its existing banking markets (internally and through additional offices) and to expand into new markets as appropriate opportunities arise. Continued growth in the Company's earning assets, which may result from internal expansion and new branch offices, at rates in excess of the rate at which its capital is increased through retained earnings, will reduce the Company's capital ratios. If the Company's capital ratios fell below \"well capitalized\" levels, the FDIC deposit insurance assessment rate would increase until capital was restored and maintained at a \"well capitalized\" level. A higher assessment rate would cause an increase in the assessments the Company pays for federal deposit insurance, which would have an adverse effect on the Company's operating results.\nManagement of the Company believes that its current and projected capital position is sufficient to maintain capital ratios significantly in excess of regulatory requirements for the next several years and allow the Company flexibility in the timing of any possible future efforts to raise additional capital. However, if, in the future, the Company needs to increase its capital to fund additional growth or satisfy regulatory requirements, its ability to raise that additional capital will depend on conditions at that time in the capital markets, economic conditions, the Company's financial performance and condition, and other factors, many of which are outside its control. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to raise additional capital on terms favorable to it or at all. Any future inability to raise additional capital on terms acceptable to the Company may have a material adverse effect on its ability to expand operations, and on its financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nTECHNOLOGY RISK\nThe Company's operations may be adversely affected by cybersecurity risks.\nThe Company relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct business. Any failure, interruption, or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in the Company's internet banking, deposit, loan, and other systems. While the Company has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of such failure, interruption, or security breach of the Company's information systems, there can be no assurance that they will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. Further, to access the Company's products and services, its customers may use computers and mobile devices that are beyond the Company's security control systems. The occurrence of any failure, interruption or security breach of the Company's communications and information systems could damage the Company's reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject the Company to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose the Company to civil litigation and possible financial liability. Additionally, the Company outsources its data processing to a third party. If the Company's third party provider encounters difficulties or if the Company has difficulty in communicating with such third party, it will significantly affect the Company's ability to adequately process and account for customer transactions, which would significantly affect its business operations.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company collects and stores sensitive data, including proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of its customers and employees in systems and on networks. The secure processing, maintenance and use of this information is critical to operations and the Company's business strategy. The Company has invested in accepted technologies, and annually reviews processes and practices that are designed to protect its networks, computers and data from damage or unauthorized access. Despite these security measures, the Company's computer systems and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. A breach of any kind could compromise systems, and the information stored there could be accessed, damaged or disclosed. A breach in security could result in legal claims, regulatory penalties, disruption in operations, and damage to the Company's reputation, which could adversely affect the Company's business. Furthermore, as cyberattacks continue to evolve and increase, the Company may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify or enhance its protective measures, or to investigate and remediate any identified information security vulnerabilities.\nMultiple major U.S. retailers, financial institutions, government agencies and departments have experienced data systems incursions reportedly resulting in the thefts of credit and debit card information, online account information, and other financial data of tens of millions of individuals and customers. Retailer incursions affect cards issued and deposit accounts maintained by many financial institutions, including the Bank. Although neither the Company's nor the Bank's systems are breached in government or retailer incursions, these events can cause the Bank to reissue a significant number of cards and take other costly steps to avoid significant theft loss to the Bank and its customers. In some cases, the Bank may be required to reimburse customers for the losses they incur. Other possible points of intrusion or disruption not within the Company's nor the Bank's control include internet service providers, electronic mail portal providers, social media portals, distant-server (so called \"cloud\") service providers, electronic data security providers, personal computers and mobile phones, telecommunications companies, and mobile phone manufacturers.\nConsumers may increasingly decide not to use the Bank to complete their financial transactions because of technological and other changes, which would have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial condition and operations.\nTechnology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions through alternative methods that historically have involved banks. In particular, the activity of fintech companies has grown significantly over recent years and is expected to continue to grow. Fintech companies have and may continue to offer bank or bank-like products and some fintech companies have applied for bank charters. In addition, other fintech companies have partnered with existing banks to allow them to offer deposit products to their customers. For example, consumers can now maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts, mutual funds or general-purpose reloadable prepaid cards. Consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and/or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as \"disintermediation,\" could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. The loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost of deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nOPERATIONAL RISK\nThe Company is dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel may materially and adversely affect the Company's operations and prospects.\nThe Company is a relationship-driven organization. A key aspect of the Company's business strategy is for its senior officers to have primary contact with current and potential customers. The Company's growth and development are in large part a result of these personalized relationships with the customer base. The success of the Company also often depends on its ability to hire and retain qualified banking officers.\nThe Company's senior officers have considerable experience in the banking industry and related financial services and are extremely valuable and would be difficult to replace. The loss of the services of these officers could have a material adverse effect upon future prospects. Although the Company has entered into employment contracts with certain of its senior executive officers, and purchased key man life insurance policies to mitigate the risk of an unforeseen departure or death of certain of the senior executive officers, it cannot offer any assurance that they and other key employees will remain employed by the Company. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of these key employees could have a material adverse effect on operations and possibly result in reduced revenues.\nFailure to maintain effective systems of internal and disclosure control could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operation and financial condition.\nEffective internal and disclosure controls are necessary for the Company to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud and to operate successfully as a public company. If the Company cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, its reputation and operating results would be harmed. As part of the Company's ongoing monitoring of internal control, it may discover material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in its internal control that require remediation. A \"material weakness\" is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nThe Company has in the past discovered, and may in the future discover, areas of its internal controls that need improvement. Even so, the Company is continuing to work to improve its internal controls. The Company cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that it implements and maintains adequate controls over its financial processes and reporting in the future. Any failure to maintain effective controls or to timely effect any necessary improvement of the Company's internal and disclosure controls could, among other things, result in losses from fraud or error, harm the Company's reputation or cause investors to lose confidence in the Company's reported financial information, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operation and financial condition.\nThe carrying value of goodwill may be adversely impacted.\nWhen the Company completes an acquisition, generally goodwill is recorded on the date of acquisition as an asset. Current accounting guidance requires for goodwill to be tested for impairment, which the Company performs an impairment analysis at least annually, rather than amortizing it over a period of time. A significant adverse change in expected future cash flows or sustained adverse change in the Company's common stock could require the asset to become impaired. If impaired, the Company would incur a non-cash charge to earnings that would have a significant impact on the results of operations. The carrying value of goodwill was approximately $85.0 million at December 31, 2021.\nThe Company relies on other companies to provide key components of the Company's business infrastructure.\nThird parties provide key components of the Company's business operations such as data processing, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, Internet connections and network access. While the Company has selected these third party vendors carefully, it does not control their actions. Any problem caused by these third parties, including those resulting from disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, cybersecurity breaches, failure of a vendor to provide services for any reason or poor performance of services, could adversely affect the Company's ability to deliver products and services to its customers and otherwise conduct its business. Financial or operational difficulties of a third party vendor could also hurt the Company's operations if those difficulties interface with the vendor's ability to serve the Company. Replacing these third party vendors could also create significant delay and expense. Accordingly, use of such third parties creates an unavoidable inherent risk to the Company's business operations.\nLEGAL, REGULATORY AND COMPLIANCE RISK\nThe Company is subject to extensive regulation which could adversely affect its business.\nThe Company's operations as a publicly traded corporation, a bank holding company, and a parent company to an insured depository institution are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state, and local governmental authorities and are subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing requirements and restrictions on part or all of the Company's operations. Because the Company's business is highly regulated, the laws, rules, and regulations applicable to it are subject to frequent and sometimes extensive change. Such changes could include higher capital requirements, increased insurance premiums, increased compliance costs, reductions of non-interest income and limitations on services that can be provided. Actions by regulatory agencies or significant litigation against the Company could cause it to devote significant time and resources to defend itself and may lead to liability or penalties that materially affect the Company and its shareholders. Any future changes in the laws, rules or regulations applicable to the Company may negatively affect the Company's business and results of operations.\nRegulatory capital standards may have an adverse effect on the Company's profitability, lending, and ability to pay dividends on the Company's securities.\nThe Company is subject to capital adequacy guidelines and other regulatory requirements specifying minimum amounts and types of capital that the Company and the Bank must maintain. From time to time, regulators implement changes to these regulatory capital adequacy guidelines. If the Company fails to meet these minimum capital guidelines and/or other regulatory requirements, its financial condition would be materially and adversely affected. The Basel III Capital Rules require bank holding companies and their subsidiaries to maintain significantly more capital as a result of higher required capital levels and more demanding regulatory capital risk weightings and calculations. The Bank must also comply with the capital requirements set forth in the \"prompt corrective action\" regulations pursuant to Section 38 of the FDIA. Satisfying capital requirements may require the Company to limit its banking operations, retain net income or reduce dividends to improve regulatory capital levels, which could negatively affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulations issued by the CFPB could adversely impact earnings due to, among other things, increased compliance costs or costs due to noncompliance.\nThe CFPB has broad rulemaking authority to administer and carry out the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act with respect to financial institutions that offer covered financial products and services to consumers. The CFPB has also been directed to write rules identifying practices or acts that are unfair, deceptive or abusive in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service. For example, the CFPB has issued a final rule requiring mortgage lenders to make a reasonable and good faith determination based on verified and documented information that a consumer applying for a mortgage loan has a reasonable ability to repay the loan according to its terms, or to originate \"qualified mortgages\" that meet specific requirements with respect to terms, pricing and fees. The rule also contains additional disclosure requirements at mortgage loan origination and in monthly statements. The requirements under the CFPB's regulations and policies could limit the Company's ability to make certain types of loans or loans to certain borrowers, or could make it more expensive and/or time consuming to make these loans, which could adversely impact the Company's profitability.\nChanges in accounting standards could impact reported earnings.\nFrom time to time, with increasing frequency, there are changes in the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Company's financial statements. These changes can materially impact how the Company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. In some instances, the Company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in the restatement of prior period financial statements. Refer to Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.\nCurrent and proposed regulation addressing consumer privacy and data use and security could increase the Company's costs and impact its reputation.\nThe Company is subject to a number of laws concerning consumer privacy and data use and security, including information safeguard rules under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. These rules require that financial institutions develop, implement and maintain a written, comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to the financial institution's size and complexity, the nature and scope of the financial institution's activities, and the sensitivity of any customer information at issue. The United States has experienced a heightened legislative and regulatory focus on privacy and data security, including requiring consumer notification in the event of a data breach. In addition, most states have enacted security breach legislation requiring varying levels of consumer notification in the event of certain types of security breaches. New regulations in these areas may increase the Company's compliance costs, which could negatively impact earnings. In addition, failure to comply with the privacy and data use and security laws and regulations to which the Company is subject, including by reason of inadvertent disclosure of confidential information, could result in fines, sanctions, penalties or other adverse consequences and loss of consumer confidence, which could materially adversely affect the Company's results of operations, overall business, and reputation.\nThe Company is subject to claims and litigation pertaining to fiduciary responsibility.\nFrom time to time, customers make claims and take legal action pertaining to the performance of the Company's fiduciary responsibilities. Whether customer claims and legal action related to the performance of the Company's fiduciary responsibilities are founded or unfounded, if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to the Company, they may result in significant financial liability and/or adversely affect the market perception of the Company and its products and services, as well as impact customer demand for those products and services. Any financial liability or reputation damage could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from customers, regulators, investors, and other stakeholders with respect to environmental, social and governance (\"ESG\") practices may impose additional costs on the Company or expose it to new or additional risks.\nCompanies are facing increasing scrutiny from customers, regulators, investors, and other stakeholders related to ESG practices and disclosure. Investor advocacy groups, investment funds and influential investors are also increasingly focused on these practices, especially as they relate to climate risk, hiring practices, the diversity of the work force, and racial and social justice issues. Increased ESG related compliance costs could result in increases to the Company\u2019s overall operational costs. Failure to adapt to or comply with regulatory requirements or investor or stakeholder expectations and standards could negatively impact the Company\u2019s reputation, ability to do business with certain partners, and the Company\u2019s stock price. New government regulations could also result in new or more stringent forms of ESG oversight and expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence, and disclosure.\nSTRATEGIC RISK\nThe Company faces strong competition from financial services companies and other companies that offer banking and other financial services, which could negatively affect the Company's business.\nThe Company encounters substantial competition from other financial institutions in its market area. Ultimately, the Company may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. Many competitors offer the same banking services that the Company offers. These competitors include national, regional, and community banks. The Company also faces competition from many other types of financial institutions, including finance companies, mutual and money market fund providers, financial technology (\"fintech\") companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, credit unions, financial subsidiaries of certain industrial corporations, and mortgage companies. In particular, competitors include several major financial companies whose greater resources may afford them a marketplace advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous banking locations and ATMs and conduct extensive promotional and advertising campaigns. Increased competition may result in reduced business for the Company.\nAdditionally, banks and other financial institutions with larger capitalization and financial intermediaries not subject to bank regulatory restrictions have larger lending limits and are thereby able to serve the credit needs of larger customers. These institutions also may have differing pricing and underwriting standards, which may adversely affect the Company through the loss of business or causing a misalignment in the Company's risk-return relationship. Areas of competition include interest rates for loans and deposits, efforts to obtain loans and deposits, and range and quality of products and services provided, including new technology-driven products and services. Technological innovation continues to contribute to greater competition in domestic financial services markets as technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services. If the Company is unable to attract and retain banking customers, it may be unable to continue to grow loan and deposit portfolios and its results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nThe inability of the Company to successfully manage its growth or implement its growth strategy may adversely affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company may not be able to successfully implement its growth strategy if it is unable to identify attractive markets, locations or opportunities to expand in the future. In addition, the ability to manage growth successfully depends on whether the Company can maintain adequate capital levels, cost controls and asset quality, and successfully integrate any businesses acquired into the Company.\nAs the Company continues to implement its growth strategy by opening new branches or acquiring branches or banks, it expects to incur increased personnel, occupancy and other operating expenses. In the case of new branches, the Company must absorb those higher expenses while it begins to generate new deposits; there is also further time lag involved in redeploying new deposits into attractively priced loans and other higher yielding earning assets. The Company's plans to expand could depress earnings in the short run, even if it efficiently executes a growth strategy leading to long-term financial benefits.\nDifficulties in combining the operations of acquired entities with the Company's own operations may prevent the Company from achieving the expected benefits from acquisitions.\nThe Company may not be able to achieve fully the strategic objectives and operating efficiencies expected in an acquisition. Inherent uncertainties exist in integrating the operations of an acquired entity. In addition, the markets and industries in which the Company and its potential acquisition targets operate are highly competitive. The Company may lose customers or the customers of acquired entities as a result of an acquisition; the Company may lose key personnel, either from the acquired entity or from itself; and the Company may not be able to control the incremental increase in noninterest expense arising from an acquisition in a manner that improves its overall operating efficiencies. These factors could contribute to the Company not achieving the expected benefits from its acquisitions within desired time frames, if at all. Future business acquisitions could be material to the Company and it may issue additional shares of common stock to pay for those acquisitions, which would dilute current shareholders' ownership interests. Acquisitions also could require the Company to use substantial cash or other liquid assets or to incur debt; the Company could therefore become more susceptible to economic downturns and competitive pressures.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR SECURITIES\nWhile the Company\u2019s common stock is currently traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, it has less liquidity than stocks for larger companies quoted on a national securities exchange.\nThe trading volume in the Company\u2019s common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market has been relatively low when compared with larger companies listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market or other stock exchanges. There is no assurance that a more active and liquid trading market for the common stock will exist in the future. Consequently, shareholders may not be able to sell a substantial number of shares for the same price at which shareholders could sell a smaller number of shares. In addition, the Company cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of the Company\u2019s common stock in the market, or the availability of shares of common stock for sale in the market, will have on the market price of the common stock.\nEconomic and other conditions may cause volatility in the price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nIn the current economic environment, the prices of publicly traded stocks in the financial services sector have been volatile. However, even in a more stable economic environment the price of the Company\u2019s common stock can be affected by a variety of factors such as expected or actual results of operations, changes in analysts\u2019 recommendations or projections, announcements of developments related to its businesses, operating and stock performance of other companies deemed to be peers, news or expectations based on the performance of others in the financial services industry, and expected impacts of a changing regulatory environment. These factors not only impact the price of the Company\u2019s common stock but could also affect the liquidity of the stock given the Company\u2019s size, geographical footprint, and industry. The price for shares of the Company\u2019s common stock may fluctuate significantly in the future, and these fluctuations may be unrelated to the Company\u2019s performance. General market price declines or market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price for shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, and the current market price of such shares may not be indicative of future market prices.\nFuture issuances of the Company\u2019s common stock could adversely affect the market price of the common stock and could be dilutive.\nThe Company is not restricted from issuing additional shares of common stock, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, shares of common stock. Issuances of a substantial number of shares of common stock, or the expectation that such issuances might occur, including in connection with acquisitions by the Company, could materially adversely affect the market price of the shares of the common stock and could be dilutive to shareholders. Because the Company\u2019s decision to issue common stock in the future will depend on market conditions and other factors, it cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of possible future issuances of its common stock. Accordingly, the Company\u2019s shareholders bear the risk that future issuances will reduce the market price of the common stock and dilute their stock holdings in the Company.\nThe primary source of the Company\u2019s income from which it pays cash dividends is the receipt of dividends from its subsidiary bank.\nThe availability of dividends from the Company is limited by various statutes and regulations. It is possible, depending upon the financial condition of the Bank and other factors, that the OCC could assert that payment of dividends or other payments is an unsafe or unsound practice. In the event the Bank was unable to pay dividends to the Company, or be limited in the payment of such dividends, the Company would likely have to reduce or stop paying common stock dividends. The Company\u2019s reduction, limitation. or failure to pay such dividends on its common stock could have a material adverse effect on the market price of the common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s governing documents and Virginia law contain anti-takeover provisions that could negatively impact its shareholders.\nThe Company\u2019s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and the Virginia Stock Corporation Act contain certain provisions designed to enhance the ability of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors to deal with attempts to acquire control of the Company. These provisions and the ability to set the voting rights, preferences and other terms of any series of preferred stock that may be issued, may be deemed to have an anti-takeover effect and may discourage takeovers (which certain shareholders may deem to be in their best interest). To the extent that such takeover attempts are discouraged, temporary fluctuations in the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock resulting from actual or rumored takeover attempts may be inhibited. These provisions also could discourage or make more difficult a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest, even though such transactions may be favorable to the interests of shareholders, and could potentially adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nGENERAL RISK\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect the Company and the adverse impacts on its business, financial position, and operations could be significant. The ultimate impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created global economic disruptions and disruptions to the lives of people around the world. Governments, businesses, and the public have taken and continue to take actions to contain the spread of COVID-19 and to mitigate its effects, including quarantines, travel bans, shelter-in-place orders, closures of businesses and schools, fiscal stimulus, and legislation designed to deliver monetary aid and other relief. While the scope, duration, and full effects continue to evolve, change and are not fully known, the pandemic and related efforts to contain it have disrupted global economic activity, adversely affected the functioning of financial markets, impacted interest rates, increased economic and market uncertainty, and disrupted trade and supply chains. If these effects continue for a prolonged time period or result in sustained economic stress or recession, such effects could have a material adverse impact on the Company in terms of credit quality, collateral values, ability of customers to repay loans, product demand, funding, operations, interest rate risk and human capital.\nIn March 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 was recognized as a global pandemic. The spread of the virus has created a global health crisis that has resulted in unprecedented uncertainty, volatility and disruption in financial markets and in governmental, commercial and consumer activity in the United States and globally. Governmental efforts in response to the outbreak in 2020 and 2021 have affected business operations and consumer activity. The Company responded during the periods with measures to ensure employee and customer safety, maintain customer service levels, and continue operations while complying with applicable laws and regulations. Mid-2020, the Company implemented a business continuity plan and protocols to continue to maintain a high level of care for its employees, customers and communities. The Company also transitioned a majority of its non-branch employees to working remotely and assisting customers by appointment only in branches or directing them to drive-thrus or ATMs. It cancelled all business travel, and has held all Company meetings through virtual platforms. In the fall of 2021, branches were re-opened with safety protocols in place but were from time to time reverted back to appointment only or drive-thru only as Covid-19 circulated. The Company continues to maintain remote work options for a portion of its employees, continues to limit non-essential business travel and continuesto hold meetings virtually. There is no guarantee these actions will be sufficient to successfully mitigate the risks presented by the COVID-19 pandemic and additional actions may be required. Future actions deemed necessary by local, state or national leaders could hinder its ability to operate going forward. Its business operations may be disrupted if key personnel or significant portions of the Company's employees are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, government actions, or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic. The Company's ability to serve its customers could be impacted if actions taken by vendors or business partners are unable to continue providing services the Company depends on.\nCOVID-19 continues to be a threat to the world. The extent, severity and duration of the current and future actions are unprecedented and, until normal economic conditions resume, the Company is unable to accurately predict or measure the effects. For this reason, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic affects its business, operations and financial conditions, as well as its regulatory capital and liquidity ratios is highly uncertain and unpredictable and depends on, among other things, new information that may emerge from the actions discussed above to combat the threats posed by the virus. If the pandemic is prolonged, the adverse impact on the markets served and on the Company's business, operations and financial condition could deepen.\nChanges in economic conditions could materially and negatively affect the Company's business.\nThe Company's business is directly impacted by economic, political, and market conditions, broad trends in industry and finance, legislative and regulatory changes, changes in government monetary and fiscal policies, and inflation, all of which are beyond the Company's control. A deterioration in economic conditions, whether caused by global, national or local events (including the COVID-19 pandemic, rising wages in a tight labor market, geopolitical instability and supply chain complications), especially within the Company's market area, could result in potentially negative material consequences such as the following, among others: loan delinquencies increasing; problem assets and foreclosures increasing; demand for products and services decreasing; low cost or noninterest bearing deposits decreasing; and collateral for loans, especially real estate, declining in value, in turn reducing customers' borrowing power, and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with existing loans. Each of these consequences may have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nWealth management income is a major source of non-interest income for the Company. Trust and brokerage fee revenue is largely dependent on the fair market value of assets under management and on trading volumes in the brokerage business. General economic conditions and their subsequent effect on the securities markets tend to act in correlation. When general economic conditions deteriorate, securities markets generally decline in value, and the Company's trust and brokerage fee revenue is negatively impacted as asset values and trading volumes decrease.\nThe Company's exposure to operational, technological and organizational risk may adversely affect the Company.\nThe Company is exposed to many types of operational risks, including reputation, legal, and compliance risk, the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors, clerical or record-keeping errors, and errors resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems.\nNegative public opinion can result from the actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, corporate governance, and acquisitions, and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect the Company's ability to attract and retain customers and can expose it to litigation and regulatory action.\nCertain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and successfully rectified. The Company's necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process its transactions may further increase the risk that technical system flaws or employee tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect. The Company may also be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond its control (for example, computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages), which may give rise to disruption of service to customers and to financial loss or liability. The Company is further exposed to the risk that its external vendors may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations (or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors by their respective employees as is the Company) and to the risk that the Company's (or its vendors') business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate.\nThe Company's risk-management framework may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss.\nThe Company maintains an enterprise risk management program that is designed to identify, quantify, monitor, report, and control the risks that it faces. These risks include, but are not limited to: strategic, interest-rate, credit, liquidity, operations, pricing, reputation, compliance, litigation and cybersecurity. While the Company assesses and improves this program on an ongoing basis, there can be no assurance that its approach and framework for risk management and related controls will effectively mitigate all risk and limit losses in its business. If conditions or circumstances arise that expose flaws or gaps in the Company's risk-management program, or if its controls break down, the Company's results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nNegative perception of the Company through media may adversely affect the Company's reputation and business.\nThe Company's reputation is critical to the success of its business. The Company believes that its brand image has been well received by customers, reflecting the fact that the brand image, like the Company\u2019s business, is based in part on trust and confidence. The Company\u2019s reputation and brand image could be negatively affected by rapid and widespread distribution of publicity through social and traditional media channels. The Company\u2019s reputation could also be affected by the Company\u2019s association with clients affected negatively through social and traditional media distribution, or other third parties, or by circumstances outside of the Company\u2019s control. Negative publicity, whether deserved or undeserved, could affect the Company\u2019s ability to attract or retain customers, or cause the Company to incur additional liabilities or costs, or result in additional regulatory scrutiny.\nClimate change and related legislative and regulatory initiatives may result in operational changes and expenditures that could significantly impact the Company\u2019s business.\nThe current and anticipated effects of climate change are creating an increasing level of concern for the state of the global environment. As a result, political and social attention to the issue of climate change has increased. Federal and state legislatures and regulatory agencies have continued to propose and advance numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives seeking to mitigate the effects of climate change. The federal banking agencies, including the OCC, have emphasized that climate-related risks are faced by banking organizations of all types and sizes and are in the process of enhancing supervisory expectations regarding banks\u2019 risk management practices. In December 2021, the OCC published proposed principles for climate risk management by banking organizations with more than $100 billion in assets. The OCC also has appointed its first ever Climate Change Risk Officer and established an internal climate risk implementation committee in order to assist with these initiatives and to support the agency\u2019s efforts to enhance its supervision of climate change risk management. Similar and even more expansive initiatives are expected, including potentially increasing supervisory expectations with respect to banks\u2019 risk management practices, accounting for the effects of climate change in stress testing scenarios and systemic risk assessments, revising expectations for credit portfolio concentrations based on climate-related factors and encouraging investment by banks in climate-related initiatives and lending to communities disproportionately impacted by the effects of climate change. To the extent that these initiatives lead to the promulgation of new regulations or supervisory guidance applicable to the Company, the Company would likely experience increased compliance costs and other compliance-related risks.\nThe lack of empirical data surrounding the credit and other financial risks posed by climate change render it impossible to predict how specifically climate change may impact the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations; however, the physical effects of climate change may also directly impact the Company. Specifically, unpredictable and more frequent weather disasters may adversely impact the value of real property securing the loans in the Bank\u2019s loan portfolio. Additionally, if insurance obtained by borrowers is insufficient to cover any losses sustained to the collateral, or if insurance coverage is otherwise unavailable to borrowers, the collateral securing loans may be negatively impacted by climate change, which could impact the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. Further, the effects of climate change may negatively impact regional and local economic activity, which could lead to an adverse effect on customers and impact the communities in which the Company operates. Overall, climate change, its effects and the resulting, unknown impact could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, geopolitical instability, public health issues, and other external events could significantly impact the Company's business.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, geopolitical instability, public health issues, and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on the Company's ability to conduct business. In addition, such events could affect the stability of the Company's deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue, and/or cause the Company to incur additional expenses. The occurrence of any such event in the future could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 86814, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "AMNB"}
