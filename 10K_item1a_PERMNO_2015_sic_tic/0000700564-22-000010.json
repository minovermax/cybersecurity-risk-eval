Risk Factors\nAn investment in our securities involves certain risks, including, among others, the risks described below. In addition to the other information contained in this Report, you should carefully consider the following risk factors.\nECONOMIC AND CREDIT RISKS.\nDifficult conditions in the economy and the financial markets may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur results of operations and financial condition are affected by conditions in the economy and the financial markets generally. Our financial performance is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where we operate and in the United States as a whole. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by: declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability, or increases in the cost, of credit and capital; changes in the rate of inflation or in interest rates; high unemployment; labor shortages; governmental fiscal and monetary policies; the level of, or changes in, prices of raw materials, goods or commodities; supply chain issues; global economic conditions; trade policies and tariffs affecting other countries as well as retaliatory policies and tariffs by such countries; geopolitical events, including escalating military tension between Russia and Ukraine; natural disasters; public health crises, such as epidemics and pandemics; acts of war or terrorism; or a combination of these or other factors.\nSpecifically, the business environment impacts the ability of borrowers to pay interest on, and repay principal of, outstanding loans and the value of collateral, if any, securing those loans, as well as demand for loans and other products and services we offer. There continues to be significant ongoing financial risk facing the U.S. economy that could negatively impact the quality of our loan portfolio. As a result, we may have to increase our provision for credit losses, which would negatively impact our results of operations, and could result in charge-offs of a higher percentage of our loans. Unlike large, national institutions, we are not able to spread the risks of unfavorable local economic conditions across a large number of diversified economies and geographic locations. If the communities in which we operate do not grow, or if prevailing economic conditions locally or nationally are unfavorable, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, increased market competition in a lower demand environment could adversely affect our profit potential.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and will likely continue to adversely affect, our business, results of operations and financial condition for an indefinite period.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused substantial disruptions in economic and social activity, both globally and in the United States. The spread of COVID-19, and related governmental actions to respond to the pandemic have caused severe disruptions in the U.S. economy, which have, in turn, disrupted, and will likely continue to disrupt, the business, activities, and operations of our customers as well as our own business and operations. In many locations throughout the U.S., the spread of COVID-19 decreased through much of 2021. However, due in large part to the increased spread of a new, more transmissible coronavirus variant, the number of individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 in the U.S. increased substantially late in 2021 causing continued governmental responses. The resulting impacts of the pandemic have continued to cause changes in consumer and business spending, borrowing needs and saving habits that have and will likely continue to affect the demand for loans and other products and services we offer as well as the creditworthiness of our borrowers and guarantors. The significant impact on commercial activity and disruptions in supply chains associated with the pandemic, both nationally and in our markets, may cause customers, vendors and counterparties to be unable to meet existing payment or other obligations to us. While employment and the national economy are showing signs of recovery, there is still significant uncertainty concerning the breadth and duration of the economic and social disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and their impact on the U.S. economy. The extent to which the pandemic continues to impact our operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the continuing progression of the COVID-19 pandemic, whether there are additional outbreaks of COVID-19 and its variants, including vaccine-resistant variants, and the actions taken to contain it or treat its impact.\nMoreover, although multiple COVID-19 vaccines and booster vaccines have received regulatory approval and are currently being distributed throughout the U.S. and the world, a significant portion of the population remains unvaccinated. If the pandemic continues to cause significant negative impacts to economic conditions, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted.\nOur business is dependent upon the willingness and ability of our customers to conduct banking and other financial transactions. In an effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, we have has adjusted service models at certain of our financial center locations, including limiting some locations to drive-up and ATM services only, offering lobby access by appointment only, and encouraging our customers to use electronic banking platforms. We expect some of these measures to remain in place permanently. The increased use of electronic banking platforms by our customers may expose us to increased operational risks, including fraud and cybersecurity risks. A significant portion of our employees have transitioned to remote or hybrid onsite-\nremote working arrangements as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which, in addition to requiring added support from our information technology infrastructure, increases cybersecurity risks. The continued spread of COVID-19 (or an outbreak of a similar highly contagious disease) could also negatively impact the business and operations of third-party service providers who perform critical services for our business. It is not yet known what impact these operational changes may have on our financial performance.\nThere continues to be broad concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic impact. The aftereffects of the pandemic may continue to have an adverse effect on, among other things, (i) our ability to attract customer deposits, (ii) the ability of our borrowers to satisfy their obligations, (iii) the demand for our loans or other products and services, and/or (iv) unemployment rates, financial markets, real estate markets or economic growth. Further, the timing and ability of our customers' businesses to ramp up to prior levels of activity will vary, depending upon geography, industry and other factors.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the economy heightens the risk associated with many of the risk factors described in this Report, including those related to economic conditions in our market areas, interest rates, loan losses, operational risks, our reliance on our executives and third-party service providers and goodwill and intangible assets impairment.\nGovernmental and regulatory actions to mitigate the COVID-19 impact could increase regulatory compliance risks and result in a material decline in our earnings.\nThere have been several regulatory and legislative actions intended to help mitigate the adverse COVID-19 economic impact on individuals, including mandates requiring financial institutions to work constructively with borrowers affected by COVID-19, temporary bans on evictions and foreclosures and mandatory loan forbearances. Due to the unforeseen nature of the pandemic, future regulatory action is uncertain and cannot be predicted. In addition, our administration of COVID-19 relief programs is likely to be subject to greater regulatory scrutiny.\nWe have offered, and may continue to offer, payment deferrals, forbearances, fee waivers, and other forms of assistance to commercial, small business and consumer customers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. If these customers are unable to repay their loans in a timely manner when payment deferrals, forbearances or other forms of assistance end, delinquency levels may increase, we may be required to reverse the accrual of interest during the deferral or forbearance period, and we may need to increase our ACL through provisions for credit losses. In addition, the existence of deferrals, forbearances and other forms of assistance provided to borrowers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic may not be considered TDRs or be required to be reflected as delinquent during the applicable deferral or forbearance period, thus potentially making it more challenging to identify deterioration in individual borrower performance and in the loan portfolio generally. See Item 1. \"Business-Supervision and Regulation-Governmental and Regulatory Actions to Mitigate the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic.\"\nWe originated a significant number of loans under the PPP, which may expose us to potential risks and may result in a large number of such loans remaining on our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe were a participating lender under the PPP, a loan program administered through the SBA, that was created to help eligible businesses, organizations and self-employed persons fund their operating costs during the COVID-19 pandemic. There are areas of ambiguity in the laws, regulations and guidance relating to the operation of the PPP that exposes us to potential risks relating to non-compliance with the PPP requirements. For example, other lenders have been named in litigation related to their processes and procedures for accepting and processing PPP loan applications as well as other matters related to PPP loans. In addition, we may be exposed to credit risk in connection with PPP loans if a determination is made by the SBA that a deficiency exists in the manner in which the PPP loan was originated, funded or serviced. If a deficiency is identified, the SBA may deny or limit its liability under its guaranty or seek to recover from us amounts paid pursuant to its guaranty. Further, in light of the speed at which the PPP was implemented, particularly due to the \"first come, first served\" nature of the program, the loans originated under the PPP may present potential fraud risk, increasing the risk that loan forgiveness may not be obtained by the borrowers and that the SBA guarantee may not be honored. In addition, there is risk that the borrowers may not qualify for the loan forgiveness feature due to the conduct of the borrower after origination of the loan. These factors may result in a significant amount of these low-yield loans remaining outstanding for a significant period of time.\nAlthough the PPP, by its terms, ended as of May 31, 2021, we continue to face increased operational demands and pressures in connection with monitoring and servicing PPP loans, processing applications for loan forgiveness and pursuing recourse under the SBA guarantees and against borrowers for PPP loan defaults. See Item 1. \"Business-Supervision and Regulation-Governmental and Regulatory Actions to Mitigate the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic.\"\nWe are subject to certain risks in connection with the establishment and level of our ACL.\nThe ACL consists of the ACL - Loans that is recorded as a reduction to loans on the consolidated balance sheets, and the ACL for OBS credit exposures that is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. While we believe that our ACL as of December 31, 2021 was sufficient to cover expected future credit losses in our financial instruments, principally the loan portfolio and OBS credit exposures, as of that date, we may need to increase our provision for credit losses in future periods due\nto changes in the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio or OBS credit exposures, forecasted economic conditions and growth in the loan portfolio or OBS credit exposures, among other factors, thereby negatively impacting our results of operations. The determination of the ACL depends significantly upon our assumptions and judgments with respect to a variety of factors, including the performance of the loan portfolio, the weighted-average remaining lives of different classifications of loans within the loan portfolio and current and forecasted economic conditions, as well as changes in lending policy, the nature and volume of the portfolio, credit concentrations, specific industry risks, competition, model imprecision and legal and regulatory requirements. If our assumptions and judgments prove to be inaccurate, our ACL might not be sufficient and additional provisions for credit losses might need to be made. Depending on the amount of such provisions for credit losses, the adverse impact on our earnings could be material.\nFurthermore, banking regulators may require us to make additional provisions for credit losses or otherwise recognize further loan charge-offs or impairments following their periodic reviews of our loan portfolio, underwriting procedures and the ACL. Any increase in the ACL or loan charge-offs required by such regulatory agencies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See \"Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Allowance for Credit Losses\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" and Item 7. \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Financial Condition-Allowance for Credit Losses and Asset Quality.\"\nOur loan portfolio composition and competition for loans subject us to credit risk.\nAt December 31, 2021, approximately 69% of our loan portfolio was in commercial loans, including PPP loans, commercial mortgage loans, and residential and commercial construction loans. Commercial loans, commercial mortgage loans and construction loans generally involve a greater degree of credit risk than residential mortgage loans and consumer loans because these loans are likely to be more sensitive to broader economic factors and conditions. Because payments on these loans often depend on the successful operation and management of borrowers' businesses and properties, repayment of such loans may be affected by factors outside the borrower's control, including adverse conditions in the real estate markets, adverse economic conditions or changes in governmental regulation. In addition, these loans typically have relatively large balances and the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in the percentage of non-performing loans. An increase in non-performing loans could result in a loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the provision for loan losses and an increase in charge-offs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, intense competition among both bank and non-bank lenders could increase pressure on us to relax our credit standards and/or underwriting criteria in order to achieve our loan growth targets potentially resulting in greater challenges in the repayment or collection of loans if economic conditions, or individual borrower performance, deteriorate. Additionally, competitive pressures could drive us to consider loans and customer relationships that are outside of our established risk appetite or target customer base, posing similar repayment and collection risk. See Item 7. \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Financial Condition-Loans.\"\nMARKET RISKS.\nWe are subject to interest rate risk.\nWe cannot predict or control changes in interest rates. We are affected by fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government, including those of the Federal Reserve Board that regulates the national money supply and engages in other lending and investment activities in order to manage recessionary and inflationary pressures, many of which affect interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits.\nIn response to the economic conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve Board's target federal funds rate has been reduced to nearly 0%. However, in the midst of rising inflation and pressure to raise interest rates, in its FOMC policy statement issued on January 26, 2022, the Federal Reserve Board strongly signaled that it will soon be time to raise the target range for the Fed Funds Rate. We cannot predict the nature or timing of any future changes in monetary, fiscal, tax and other policies; however, as discussed below, such changes are likely to affect our activities and financial results.\nNet interest income is the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is the most significant component of our net income, accounting for approximately 73% of total revenues in 2021. Changes in market interest rates, in the shape of the yield curve or in spreads between different market interest rates can have a material effect on our net interest margin. The rates on some interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings, adjust concurrently with, or within a brief period after, changes in market interest rates, while others adjust only periodically or not at all during their terms. Thus, changes in market interest rates might, for example, result in an increase in the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities that is not accompanied by a corresponding increase in the interest earned on interest-earning assets, or the increase in interest earned\nmight be at a slower pace, or in a smaller amount, than the increase in interest paid, reducing our net interest income and/or net interest margin. See Item 7. \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Net Interest Income.\"\nChanges in interest rates may also affect the average life of loans and certain investment securities, including mortgage-backed securities. Increases in interest rates may extend the average life of fixed rate assets potentially restricting our ability to reinvest in higher yielding alternatives, reduce demand for loans and may result in customers withdrawing certificates of deposit early. Conversely, decreases in interest rates can result in increased prepayments of loans and certain investment securities, as borrowers or issuers refinance to reduce their borrowing costs. Under those circumstances, we would be subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that we are not able to reinvest the money received from such prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates on the loans and investment securities that are prepaid.\nChanges in interest rates also affect the fair value of interest-earning investment securities. Generally, the value of interest-earning investment securities moves inversely with changes in interest rates. In the event that the fair value of an investment security declines below its amortized cost, we are required to determine whether the decline constitutes an OTTI. The determination of whether a decline in fair value is other-than-temporary depends on a number of factors, including whether we have the intent and ability to retain the investment security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. If a determination is made that a decline is other-than-temporary, an OTTI charge is recorded.\nThe replacement of LIBOR as a financial benchmark presents risks to the financial instruments we originated or hold.\nLIBOR is the reference rate used for many our transactions, including variable and adjustable rate loans, derivative contracts, borrowings and other financial instruments. A reduced volume of interbank unsecured term borrowing, coupled with legal and regulatory proceedings related to rate manipulation by certain financial institutions, led to international reconsideration of LIBOR as a financial benchmark. The FCA announced in July 2017 that the sustainability of LIBOR cannot be guaranteed. Accordingly, although the FCA confirmed the extension of overnight and 1-, 3-, 6- and 12-month LIBOR through June 30, 2023 in order to provide financial institutions greater time to manage the transition from LIBOR, the FCA is no longer persuading, or compelling, banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR. The federal banking regulatory agencies, including the OCC, previously determined that banks must cease entering into any new contract that uses LIBOR as a reference rate by no later than December 31, 2021. In addition, banks have been encouraged to identify contracts that extend beyond June 30, 2023 and implement plans to identify and address insufficient contingency provisions in those contracts.\nWhile there is no consensus on what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, the OCC has opined that national banks may use any reference rate for loans that a bank determines to be appropriate for its funding model and customer needs. Industry groups and certain committees (e.g., the ARRC) have, among other things, published recommended fallback language for LIBOR-linked financial instruments, identified recommended alternatives for certain LIBOR rates (e.g., the SOFR as the recommended alternative to U.S. Dollar LIBOR), and proposed implementation of the recommended alternatives in floating rate instruments. At this time, it is not possible to predict whether these recommendations and proposals will be broadly accepted, whether they will continue to evolve, and what the effect of their implementation may be on the markets for floating-rate financial instruments. The uncertainty surrounding potential reforms, including the use of alternative reference rates and changes to the methods and processes used to calculate rates, may have an adverse effect on the trading market for LIBOR-based securities, loan yields, and the amounts received and paid on derivative contracts and other financial instruments. In addition, the implementation of LIBOR reform proposals has and will continue to result in increased compliance and operational costs.\nChanges in interest rates can affect demand for our products and services.\nMovements in interest rates can cause demand for some of our products and services to be cyclical. For example, demand for residential mortgage loans has historically tended to increase during periods when interest rates were declining and to decrease during periods when interest rates were rising. As a result, we may need to periodically increase or decrease the size of certain of our businesses, including our personnel, to match increases and decreases in demand and volume. The need to change the scale of these businesses is challenging, and there is often a lag between changes in the businesses and our reaction to these changes.\nPrice fluctuations in securities markets, as well as other market events, such as a disruption in credit and other markets and the abnormal functioning of markets for securities, could have an impact on our results of operations.\nThe market value of our securities investments, which include mortgage-backed securities, state and municipal securities, auction rate securities, and corporate debt securities are particularly sensitive to price fluctuations and market events. Declines in the values of our securities holdings, combined with adverse changes in the expected cash flows from these investments, could result in OTTI charges.\nOur investment management and trust services revenue, which is partially based on the value of the underlying investment portfolios, can also be impacted by fluctuations in the securities markets. If the values of those investment portfolios decrease, whether due to factors influencing U.S. or international securities markets, in general, or otherwise, our revenue could be negatively impacted. In addition, our ability to sell our securities brokerage services is dependent, in part, upon consumers' level of confidence in securities markets. See Item 7A. \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\"\nLIQUIDITY RISK.\nChanges in interest rates or disruption in liquidity markets may adversely affect our sources of funding.\nWe must maintain sufficient sources of liquidity to meet the demands of our depositors and borrowers, support our operations and meet regulatory expectations. Our liquidity management policies and practices emphasize core deposits and repayments and maturities of loans and investments as our primary sources of liquidity. These primary sources of liquidity can be supplemented by FHLB advances, borrowings from the FRB, proceeds from the sales of loans and use of our liquidity resources, including capital markets funding. Lower-cost, core deposits may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates, and secondary sources of liquidity can be more costly to us than funding provided by deposit account balances having similar maturities. In addition, adverse changes in our results of operations or financial condition, downgrades in our credit ratings, regulatory actions involving us, or changes in regulatory, industry or market conditions could lead to increases in the cost of these secondary sources of liquidity, the inability to refinance or replace these secondary funding sources as they mature, or the withdrawal of unused borrowing capacity under these secondary funding sources.\nWe rely on customer deposits as our primary source of funding. A substantial majority of our deposits are in non-maturing accounts that customers can withdraw on demand or upon several days' notice. Factors, many of which are outside our control, can cause fluctuations in both the level and cost of customer deposits. These factors include competition for customer deposits from other financial institutions and non-bank competitors, changes in interest rates, the rates of return available from alternative investments or asset classes, changes in customer confidence in us or in financial institutions generally, and the liquidity needs of our deposit customers. Further, deposits from state and municipal entities, primarily in non-maturing, interest-bearing accounts, are a significant source of deposit funding for us, representing approximately 11% of total deposits at December 31, 2021. State and municipal customers frequently maintain large deposit account balances substantially in excess of the FDIC insurance limit, and these depositors may be more sensitive than other depositors to changes in interest rates. Advances in technology, such as online banking, mobile banking, digital payment platforms and the acceleration of financial technology innovation, have also made it easier to move money, potentially causing customers to switch financial institutions or switch to non-bank competitors. Movement of customer deposits into higher-yielding deposit accounts we offer, the need to offer higher interest rates on deposit accounts to retain customer deposits, or the movement of customer deposits into alternative investments or deposits of other banks or non-bank providers could increase our funding costs, reduce our net interest margin and/or create liquidity challenges.\nMarket conditions have been negatively impacted by disruptions in the liquidity markets in the past, and such disruptions or an adverse change in our results of operations or financial condition could, in the future, have a negative impact on secondary sources of liquidity. If we are not able to continue to rely primarily on customer deposits to meet our liquidity and funding needs, access secondary, non-deposit funding sources on favorable terms or otherwise fail to manage our liquidity effectively, our ability to continue to grow may be constrained, and our liquidity, operating margins, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. See Item 7A. \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk-Interest Rate Risk, Asset/Liability Management and Liquidity.\"\nLEGAL, COMPLIANCE AND REPUTATIONAL RISKS.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation and supervision and may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations or any failure to comply with laws and regulations.\nVirtually every aspect of our operations is subject to extensive regulation and supervision by federal and state regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board, OCC, FDIC, CFPB, DOJ, UST, SEC, HUD, DOL, state attorneys general and state banking, financial services, securities and insurance regulators. Under this regulatory framework, regulatory agencies have broad authority in carrying out their supervisory, examination and enforcement responsibilities to address compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to capital adequacy, asset quality, earnings, liquidity, risk management and financial accounting and reporting as well as laws and regulations governing consumer protection, fair lending, privacy, information security and cybersecurity risk management, third-party vendor risk management, AML and sanctions and anti-terrorism laws. Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements, including inadvertent or unintentional violations, may result in the assessment of fines and penalties, or the commencement of informal or formal regulatory enforcement actions against us. Other negative consequences can also result from such failures, including regulatory restrictions on our activities, restrictions on our ability to grow through acquisition, reputational damage, restrictions on the ability of institutional investment managers to invest in our securities and increases in our costs of doing business.\nThe U.S. Congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies continually review banking and other laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. Changes in applicable federal or state laws, regulations or governmental policies may affect us and our business. The effects of such changes are difficult to predict and may produce unintended consequences. New laws, regulations or changes in the regulatory environment could limit the types of financial services and products we may offer, alter demand for existing products and services, increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, increase compliance burdens, or otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. For example, in December 2021, the CFPB published a report providing data on banks' overdraft and non-sufficient funds fee revenues as well as observations regarding customer protection issues relating to participation in such programs. The CFPB has indicated that it intends to pursue enforcement actions against banking organizations, and their executives, that oversee overdraft practices that are deemed unlawful. In addition, the Comptroller of the Currency has identified potential options for reform of national bank overdraft protection practices, including providing a grace period before the imposition of a fee, refraining from charging multiple fees in a single day and eliminating fees altogether. In 2021, we recognized $12.8 million in consumer overdraft fees. The adoption of new rules or supervisory guidance or more aggressive examination and enforcement policies with respect to overdraft protection practices could cause us to modify overdraft programs and practices in ways that may have a negative impact on our revenues that, in turn, could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nCompliance with banking and financial services statutes and regulations is also important to our ability to engage in new activities or to expand existing activities. Regulators continue to scrutinize banks through longer and more intensive examinations. Federal and state banking agencies possess broad powers to take supervisory actions, as they deem appropriate. These supervisory actions may result in higher capital requirements, higher deposit insurance premiums and limitations on our operations and expansion activities that could have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability. We have dedicated significant time, effort, and expense over time to comply with regulatory and supervisory standards and requirements imposed by our regulators, and we expect that we will continue to do so. If we fail to develop at a reasonable cost the systems and processes necessary to comply with the standards and requirements imposed by these rules, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act continues to have a significant impact on our business and results of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act continues to have a substantial impact on many aspects of the financial services industry. We will likely continue to be impacted by the Dodd-Frank Act in the future, including the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act that reduced debit card interchange revenue of banks and revised FDIC deposit insurance assessments. We have also been impacted by the Dodd-Frank Act in the areas of corporate governance, capital requirements, risk management and regulation under federal consumer protection laws.\nThe CFPB, established pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, has imposed enforcement actions against a variety of bank and non-bank market participants with respect to a number of consumer financial products and services. These enforcement actions have resulted in those participants expending significant time, money and resources to adjust to the initiatives being pursued by the CFPB. These enforcement actions may also serve as precedent for how the CFPB interprets and enforces consumer protection laws, including practices or acts that are deemed to be unfair, deceptive or abusive, with respect to supervised institutions and may result in the imposition of higher standards of compliance with such laws. Other federal financial regulatory agencies, including the OCC, as well as state attorneys general and state banking agencies and other state financial regulators have also been active in this area with respect to institutions over which they have jurisdiction. See Item 1. \"Business-Supervision and Regulation.\"\nChanges in U.S. federal, state or local tax laws may negatively impact our financial performance.\nWe are subject to changes in tax laws that could increase our effective tax rate. These law changes may be retroactive to previous periods and, as a result, could negatively affect our current and future financial performance. In December 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law resulting in significant changes to the Tax Code. The Tax Act reduced our federal corporate income tax rate to 21% beginning in 2018. However, the Tax Act also imposed limitations on our ability to take certain deductions, such as the deduction for FDIC deposit insurance premiums, which partially offset the increase in net income from the lower tax rate. During 2021, Congress debated various proposals for increases in the corporate tax rate and possible surcharges on corporate share repurchases as part of the funding for various spending initiatives. Any such increase in the corporate tax rate or surcharges would adversely affect our results of operations in future periods.\nIn addition, a number of the changes to the Tax Code are set to expire in future years. There is substantial uncertainty concerning whether those expiring provisions will be extended, or whether future legislation will further revise the Tax Code.\nCapital requirements have been adopted by U.S. banking regulators that may limit our ability to return earnings to shareholders or operate or invest in our business.\nWe are subject to capital requirements under the BASEL III Rules. Failure to meet the established capital requirements could result in the federal banking regulators placing limitations or conditions on our activities or restricting the commencement of new activities, and such failure could subject us to a variety of enforcement remedies, including limiting our ability to pay dividends, the issuance of a directive to increase capital, and/or the termination of FDIC deposit insurance. In addition, the failure to comply with the capital conservation buffer would result in restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary cash bonus payments to executive officers. As of December 31, 2021, our current capital levels exceeded the minimum capital requirements, including the capital conservation buffer, as set forth in the BASEL III Rules. See Item 1. \"Business-Supervision and Regulation-Capital Requirements.\"\nThe implementation of certain regulations with regard to regulatory capital could disproportionately affect our regulatory capital position relative to that of our competitors, including those who may not be subject to the same regulatory requirements.\nFrom time to time we may be the subject of litigation and governmental or administrative proceedings. Adverse outcomes of any such litigation or proceedings may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations as well as our reputation.\nMany aspects of our business involve substantial risk of legal liability. From time to time, we have been named or threatened to be named as defendant in various lawsuits arising from our business activities (and in some cases from the activities of companies that we or our subsidiaries acquired). In addition, we are periodically the subject of governmental investigations and other forms of regulatory or governmental inquiry. For example, in 2020, we consented to the entry of an administrative civil cease-and-desist order and paid a civil monetary penalty of $1.5 million to resolve an investigation by the staff of the SEC Division of Enforcement regarding certain accounting determinations that could have impacted our reported earnings per share. Like other large financial institutions, we are also subject to risk from potential employee misconduct, including non-compliance with policies and improper use or disclosure of confidential information. These lawsuits, investigations, inquiries and other matters could lead to administrative, civil or criminal proceedings, result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, restitution, injunctions or other types of sanctions, the need for us to undertake remedial actions, or otherwise alter our business, financial or accounting practices. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory actions against us could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and/or cause significant reputational harm. We establish reserves for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and we can reasonably estimate the amount of loss. For matters where a loss is not probable, or we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of loss, no loss reserve is established. However, we may still incur potentially significant legal costs for a matter even if a reserve has not been established.\nWe can provide no assurance as to the outcome or resolution of legal or administrative actions or investigations, and such actions and investigations may result in judgments against us for significant damages or the imposition of regulatory restrictions on our operations. Resolution of these types of matters can be prolonged and costly, and the ultimate results or judgments are uncertain due to the inherent uncertainty in the outcomes of litigation and other proceedings.\nSTRATEGIC AND EXTERNAL RISKS.\nWe may not be able to achieve our growth plans.\nOur business plan includes the pursuit of profitable growth. To achieve profitable growth, we may pursue new lines of business or offer new products or services, all of which can involve significant costs, uncertainties and risks. Any new activity we pursue may require a significant investment of time and resources and may not generate the anticipated return on that investment. In addition, we may not be able to effectively implement and manage any new activities. External factors, such as the need to comply with additional regulations, the availability, or introduction, of competitive alternatives in the market, and changes in customer preferences may also impact the successful implementation of any new activity. Any new activity could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Sustainable growth requires that we manage risks by balancing loan and deposit growth at acceptable levels of risk, maintaining adequate liquidity and capital, hiring and retaining qualified employees, and successfully managing the costs and implementation risks with respect to strategic projects and initiatives. If we are not able to adequately identify and manage the risks associated with new activities, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted.\nWe face a variety of risks in connection with potential acquisitions.\nWe may from time to time seek to supplement organic growth through acquisitions of banks, branches or other financial businesses or assets. Potential acquisitions are typically subject to regulatory or other approvals and there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain any such approvals in a timely manner, without restrictive conditions or at all. Even if required approvals are obtained, acquisitions involve numerous risks, including lower than expected performance or higher than\nexpected costs, difficulties related to integration, diversion of management's attention from other business activities, the potential loss of key employees, changes in relationships with customers, disruption of the operations of the acquired business and our business, exposure to potential asset quality issues and unknown or contingent liabilities of the acquired business and changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the acquired business.\nAcquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and, therefore, some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction. Failure to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we face significant competition from other financial services institutions, some of which may have greater financial resources than us, when considering acquisition opportunities. Accordingly, attractive opportunities may not be available and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying, completing or integrating future acquisitions.\nOn July 9, 2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order on Promoting Competition in the American Economy. Among other initiatives, the Executive Order encouraged the federal banking agencies to review their current merger oversight practices under the BHCA and the Bank Merger Act and adopt a plan for revitalization of such practices. There are many steps that must be taken by the agencies before any formal changes to the framework for evaluating bank mergers can be finalized and the prospects for such action are uncertain at this time; however, the adoption of more expansive or prescriptive standards may have an impact on our acquisition activities.\nThe competition we face is significant and may reduce our customer base and negatively impact our results of operations.\nThere is significant competition among commercial banks in the market areas we serve. In addition, we also compete with other providers of financial services, including savings and loan associations, credit unions, consumer finance companies, securities firms, insurance companies, commercial finance and leasing companies, the mutual funds industry, full-service brokerage firms and discount brokerage firms, some of which are subject to less extensive regulation than we are. Some of our competitors have greater resources, higher lending limits, lower cost of funds and may offer other services we do not offer. We also experience competition from a variety of institutions outside our market areas. Some of these institutions conduct business primarily over the Internet and, as a result, may be able to realize certain cost savings and offer products and services at more favorable rates and with greater convenience to the customer. The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. In addition, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as funds transfers, payment services, residential mortgage loans, consumer loans and wealth and investment management services. Competition with non-banks, including technology companies, to provide financial products and services is intensifying. In particular, the activity of Fintechs has grown significantly over recent years and is expected to continue to grow. Fintechs have and may continue to offer bank or bank-like products. In July 2018, the OCC announced that it would begin accepting applications from Fintechs to become special purpose national banks. More recently, the OCC conditionally approved the application of a nonbank Fintech for a full-service national bank charter. Similar developments are likely to result in even greater competition within all areas of our operations.\nTransactions utilizing digital assets, including cryptocurrencies, stablecoins and other similar assets, has increased substantially. Certain characteristics of digital asset transactions, such as the speed with which such transactions can be conducted, the ability to transact without the involvement of regulated intermediaries, the ability to engage in transactions across multiple jurisdictions, and the anonymous nature of the transactions, are appealing to certain consumers, notwithstanding the various risks posed by such transactions. Accordingly, digital asset service providers, which at present, are not subject to the extensive regulations imposed upon banking organizations and other financial institutions, have become active competitors for our customers' banking business.\nCompetition may adversely affect the rates we pay on deposits and charge on loans, and could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the income generated from those deposits, thereby potentially adversely affecting our profitability and our ability to continue to grow. Our profitability and continued growth depend upon our continued ability to successfully compete in the market areas we serve. See Item 1. \"Business-Competition.\"\nClimate change may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe operate in areas where our business and the activities of our customers could be impacted by the effects of climate change. The effects of climate change may include increased frequency or severity of weather-related events, such as severe storms, hurricanes, flooding and droughts, and rising sea levels. These effects can disrupt business operations, damage property, devalue assets and change consumer and business preferences, which may adversely affect borrowers, increase credit risk and reduce demand for our products and services. In addition, increasing concerns over the long-term impacts of climate change have led, and will likely continue to lead, to legislative and regulatory initiatives to combat climate change and may result in increased supervisory expectations with respect to banks\u2019 risk management practices related to climate change. For instance, the FSOC, of which the OCC is a member, published a report in October 2021 identifying climate-related financial risk as an\n\"emerging threat\" to financial stability. The leadership of the federal banking agencies, including the Comptroller of the Currency, have emphasized that climate-related risks are faced by banking organizations of all types and sizes, specifically including physical and transition risks, and are in the process of enhancing supervisory expectations regarding banks' risk management practices. The OCC also has appointed its first ever Climate Change Risk Officer and established an internal climate risk implementation committee in order to assist with these initiatives and to support the agency's efforts to enhance its supervision of climate change risk management. To the extent that these initiatives lead to the promulgation of new regulations or supervisory guidance applicable to us, compliance costs and other compliance-related risks would be expected to increase. Climate change, its effects and the resulting, unknown impacts could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to ESG risks that could adversely affect our reputation and the market price of our securities.\nWe are subject to a variety of risks arising from ESG matters. ESG matters include climate risk, hiring practices, the diversity of our work force, and racial and social justice issues involving our personnel, customers and third parties with whom we otherwise do business. Risks arising from ESG matters may adversely affect, among other things, our reputation and the market price of our securities.\nFurther, we may be exposed to negative publicity based on the identity and activities of those to whom we lend and with which we otherwise do business. Any such negative publicity could arise from adverse news coverage in traditional media and could also spread through the use of social media platforms. Our relationships and reputation with our existing and prospective customers and third parties we do business with could be damaged if we were to become the subject of any such negative publicity. Such damage could, in turn, have an adverse effect on our ability to attract and retain customers and employees and could have a negative impact on the market price of our securities.\nCertain investors have begun to consider the steps taken and resources allocated by financial institutions and other commercial organizations to address ESG matters when making investment and operational decisions. Certain investors are beginning to incorporate the business risks of climate change and the adequacy of companies' responses to the risks posed by climate change and other ESG matters into their investment considerations. These shifts in investing priorities may result in adverse effects on the market price of our securities to the extent that investors determine that we have not made sufficient progress on ESG matters.\nIf the goodwill that we have recorded or record in the future in connection with our acquisitions becomes impaired, it could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nWe have supplemented our internal growth with strategic acquisitions of banks, branches and other financial services companies. In the future, we may seek to supplement organic growth through additional acquisitions. If the purchase price of an acquired company exceeds the fair value of the company's net assets, the excess is carried on the acquirer's balance sheet as goodwill. As of December 31, 2021, we had $534.3 million of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet. We are required to evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually. Write-downs of the amount of any impairment, if necessary, are to be charged to earnings in the period in which the impairment occurs. There can be no assurance that future evaluations of goodwill will not result in impairment charges.\nChanges in accounting policies, standards, and interpretations could materially affect how we report our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, as well as revenues and expenses during the period. A summary of the accounting policies that we consider to be most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations because they require management's most difficult judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain, including those related to the ACL, goodwill, income taxes, and fair value measurements, is set forth in Item 7. \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies\" and within \"Note 1- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nA variety of factors could affect the ultimate values of assets, liabilities, income and expenses recognized and reported in our financial statements, and these ultimate values may differ materially from those determined based on management's estimates and assumptions. In addition, the FASB, regulatory agencies, and other bodies that establish accounting standards from time to time change the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of our financial statements. Further, the bodies that establish and interpret the accounting standards (such as the FASB, the SEC, and banking regulators) may change prior interpretations or positions regarding how these standards should be applied. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially affect how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations.\nOPERATIONAL RISKS.\nWe are exposed to many types of operational and other risks, and our framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk.\nWe are exposed to many types of operational risk, including the risk of human error or fraud by employees and other third parties, intentional and inadvertent misrepresentation by loan applicants, borrowers or guarantors, unsatisfactory performance by employees and vendors, clerical and record-keeping errors, computer and telecommunications systems malfunctions or failures and reliance on data that may be faulty or incomplete. In an environment characterized by continual, rapid technological change, when we introduce new products and services, or make changes to our information technology systems and processes, these operational risks are increased. Any of these operational risks could result in the diminished ability to operate one or more of our businesses, financial loss, potential liability to customers, inability to secure insurance, reputational damage and regulatory intervention, any or all of which could materially adversely affect us.\nOur risk management framework is subject to inherent limitations, and risks may exist, or develop in the future, that we have not anticipated or identified. If our risk management framework proves to be ineffective, we could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected.\nOur operational risks include risks associated with third-party vendors and other financial institutions.\nWe rely upon certain third-party vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain our day-to-day operations, including, notably, responsibility for the core processing system that services Fulton Bank. Accordingly, our operations are exposed to the risk that these vendors might not perform in accordance with applicable contractual arrangements or service level agreements. The failure of an external vendor to perform in accordance with applicable contractual arrangements or service level agreements could be disruptive to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and/or damage our reputation. Further, third-party vendor risk management continues to be a point of regulatory emphasis recently. A failure to follow applicable regulatory guidance in this area could expose us to regulatory sanctions.\nThe commercial soundness of many financial institutions may be closely interrelated as a result of credit, trading, execution of transactions or other relationships between the institutions. As a result, concerns about, or a default or threatened default by, one institution could lead to significant market-wide liquidity and credit problems, losses or defaults by other institutions. This risk is sometimes referred to as \"systemic risk\" and may adversely affect financial intermediaries, such as clearing agencies, clearing houses, banks, securities firms and exchanges with which we interact on a daily basis, and, therefore, could adversely affect us.\nAny of these operational or other risks could result in our diminished ability to operate one or more of our businesses, financial loss, potential liability to customers, inability to secure insurance, reputational damage and regulatory intervention and could materially adversely affect us.\nLoss of, or failure to adequately safeguard, confidential or proprietary information may adversely affect our operations, net income or reputation.\nOur business is highly dependent on information systems and technology and the ability to collect, process, transmit and store significant amounts of confidential information regarding customers, employees and others on a daily basis. While we perform some of the functions required to operate our business directly, we also rely on third parties for significant business functions, such as processing customer transactions, providing cloud-based infrastructure, software and data storage services, maintaining customer-facing websites, including our online and mobile banking functions, and developing software for new products and services. These relationships require us to allow third parties to access, store, process and transmit customer information. As a result, we may be subject to cybersecurity risks directly, as well as indirectly, through the vendors to whom we outsource business functions and the downstream service providers of those vendors. Cyber threats could result in unauthorized access, loss or destruction of confidential information or customer data, unavailability, degradation or denial of service, introduction of computer viruses or ransomware and other adverse events causing us to incur additional costs repairing systems, restoring data or adding new personnel or protection technologies. Cyber threats may also subject us to regulatory investigations, litigation or enforcement actions, require the payment of regulatory fines or penalties or undertaking costly remediation efforts with respect to third parties affected by a cybersecurity incident, all or any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and/or damage our reputation.\nCritical infrastructure sectors, including the financial services sector, increasingly have been the targets of cyber-attacks, including attacks emanating from foreign countries such as the attack on the information technology company SolarWinds, which affected many Fortune 500 companies as well as U.S. government agencies. Cyber-attacks involving large financial\ninstitutions, including denial of service attacks designed to disrupt external customer-facing services, nation-state cyber-attacks and ransomware attacks designed to deny organizations access to key internal resources or systems, as well as targeted social engineering and email attacks designed to allow unauthorized persons to obtain access to an institution's information systems and data or that of its customers, are becoming more common and increasingly sophisticated. Further, threat actors are increasingly seeking to target vulnerabilities in software systems used by large numbers of banking organizations in order to conduct malicious cyber activities.\nLike other financial institutions, we experience malicious cyber activity on an ongoing basis directed at our websites, computer systems, software, networks and our users. This malicious activity includes attempts at unauthorized access, implantation of computer viruses or malware, and denial-of-service attacks. We also experience large volumes of phishing and other forms of social engineering attempted for the purpose of perpetrating fraud against us, our employees or our customers. While, to date, malicious cyber activity, cyber-attacks and other information security breaches have not had a material adverse impact on us, there can be no assurance that such events will not have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition or reputation in the future.\nCybersecurity risks for financial institutions also have evolved as a result of the use of cloud computing and new technologies, devices and delivery channels to transmit and store data and conduct financial transactions. The adoption of new products, services and delivery channels contribute to a more complex operating environment, which enhances operational risk and presents the potential for additional structural vulnerabilities. In addition, the ongoing and widespread remote work environment necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic has subjected institutions to additional cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks.\nWe use monitoring and preventive controls to detect and respond to data breaches and cyber threats involving our systems before they become significant. We regularly evaluate our systems and controls and implement upgrades as necessary. We also attempt to reduce our exposure to our vendors' data privacy and cyber incidents by performing initial vendor due diligence that is updated periodically for critical vendors, negotiating service level standards with vendors, negotiating for indemnification from vendors for confidentiality and data breaches, and limiting third-party access to the least privileged level necessary to perform outsourced functions. The additional cost to us of data and cybersecurity monitoring and protection systems and controls includes the cost of hardware and software, third party technology providers, consulting and forensic testing firms, insurance premium costs and legal fees and the incremental cost of personnel who focus a substantial portion of their responsibilities on data and cybersecurity.\nThere can be no assurance that the measures we employ to detect and combat direct or indirect cyber threats will be effective. In addition, because the methods of cyber-attacks change frequently or, in some cases, are not recognized until launched, we may be unable to implement effective preventive control measures to proactively address these methods. Our or a vendor's failure to promptly identify and counter a cyber-attack may result in increased costs and other negative consequences, including the loss of, or inability to access, data, degradation or denial of service and introduction of computer viruses. Although we maintain insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions, cover certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be inapplicable or otherwise insufficient to cover any or all losses. Further, a successful cyber-attack that results in a significant loss of customer data or compromises our ability to function could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nAccount data compromise, malware and ransomware events affecting a broad spectrum of commercial businesses and governmental entities in recent years have resulted in heightened legislative and regulatory focus on privacy, data protection and information security. New or revised laws and regulations may significantly impact our current and planned privacy, data protection and information security-related practices, the collection, use, sharing, retention and safeguarding of consumer and employee information, and current or planned business activities. Compliance with current or future privacy, data protection and information security laws to which we are subject could result in higher compliance and technology costs and could restrict our ability to provide certain products and services that could materially and adversely affect our profitability. Our failure to comply with privacy, data protection and information security laws could result in potentially significant regulatory and governmental investigations and/or actions, litigation, fines, sanctions and damage to our reputation and our brand.\nWe are subject to a variety of risks in connection with the origination and sale of loans.\nWe originate residential mortgage loans and other loans, such as loans guaranteed, in part, by the SBA, all or portions of which are later sold in the secondary market to government sponsored enterprises or agencies, such as the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and other non-government sponsored investors. In connection with such sales, we make certain representations and warranties with respect to matters such as the underwriting, origination, documentation or other characteristics of the loans sold. We may be required to repurchase a loan, or to reimburse the purchaser of a loan for any related losses, if it is determined that the loan sold was in violation of representations or warranties made at the time of the sale, and, in some cases, if there is evidence of borrower fraud, in the event of early payment default by the borrower on the loan, or for other reasons. We maintain reserves for potential losses on certain loans sold, however, it is possible that losses incurred in connection with loan repurchases and reimbursement payments may be in excess of any applicable reserves, and we may be\nrequired to increase reserves and may sustain additional losses associated with such loan repurchases and reimbursement payments in the future, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, the sale of residential mortgage loans and other loans in the secondary market serves as a source of non-interest income and liquidity for us and can reduce our exposure to interest rate risk. Efforts to reform government sponsored enterprises and agencies, changes in the types of, or standards for, loans purchased by government sponsored enterprises or agencies and other investors, or our failure to maintain our status as an eligible seller of such loans may limit our ability to sell these loans. Our inability to continue to sell these loans could reduce our non-interest income, limit our ability to originate and fund these loans in the future, and make managing interest rate risk more challenging, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe continually encounter technological change.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services, including the potential utilization of blockchain technology to provide alternative high-speed payment systems. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. The costs of implementing new technology, including personnel, can be high, in both absolute and relative terms, and we may not achieve intended benefits of new technology initiatives. Moreover, the implementation of new technology can expose us to new or increased operational risks. Many of our financial institution competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. In addition, new payment, credit and investment and wealth management services developed and offered by non-bank or non-traditional competitors pose an increasing threat to the products and services traditionally provided by financial institutions like us. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services, be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers, or effectively deploy new technologies to improve the efficiency of our operations. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere can be no assurance, given the past pace of change and innovation, that our technology, either purchased or developed internally, will meet or continue to meet our needs and the needs of our customers.\nIn addition, advances in technology, as well as changing customer preferences favoring access to our products and services through digital channels, could decrease the value of our branch network and other assets. If customers increasingly choose to access our products and services through digital channels, we may find it necessary to consolidate, close or sell branch locations or restructure our branch network. These actions could lead to losses on assets, expenses to reconfigure branches and the loss of customers in affected markets. As a result, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.\nRISKS RELATED TO AN INVESTMENT IN OUR SECURITIES.\nWe are a bank holding company and rely on dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries for substantially all of our revenue and our ability to make dividend payments, distributions and other payments.\nWe are a bank holding company, a separate and distinct legal entity from our bank and non-bank subsidiaries, and we depend on the payment of dividends and other payments and distributions from our subsidiaries, principally Fulton Bank, for substantially all of our revenues. As a result, our ability to make dividend payments on our common and preferred stock depends primarily on compliance with applicable federal regulatory requirements and the receipt of dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries. There are various regulatory and prudential supervisory restrictions, which may change from time to time, that impact the ability of Fulton Bank to pay dividends or make other payments to us. There can be no assurance that Fulton Bank will be able to pay dividends at past levels, or at all, in the future. If we do not receive sufficient cash dividends or are unable to borrow from Fulton Bank, then we may not have sufficient funds to pay dividends to our shareholders, repurchase our common stock or service our debt obligations. See Item 1. \"Business-Supervision and Regulation-Loans and Dividends from Bank Subsidiary.\"\nIn addition, we have pursued a strategy of capital management under which we have sought to deploy capital through stock repurchases and increased regular dividends and special dividends on our common stock, in a manner that is beneficial to our shareholders. This capital management strategy is subject to regulatory supervision. In July 2019, the Federal Reserve Board eliminated the standalone prior approval requirement in the capital rules for repurchase or redemption of common stock. In certain circumstances, however, our repurchases of common stock may be subject to a prior approval or notice requirement under Federal Reserve Board regulations or policies. As a result, we may not be able to enter the market for stock repurchases on a timely basis when our board of directors and management believe such repurchases to be most opportune, or at all.\nAnti-takeover provisions could negatively impact our shareholders.\nProvisions of banking laws, Pennsylvania corporate law and of our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or have the effect of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire control of us. To the extent that these provisions discourage such a transaction, holders of our common stock may not have an opportunity to dispose of part or all of their stock at a higher price than that prevailing in the market. These provisions may also adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In addition, some of these provisions make it more difficult to remove, and thereby may serve to entrench, our incumbent directors and officers, even if their removal would be regarded by some shareholders as desirable.\nCertain provisions of Pennsylvania corporate law applicable to us and our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws include provisions that may be considered to be \"anti-takeover\" in nature because they may have the effect of discouraging or making more difficult the acquisition of control of us by means of a hostile tender offer, exchange offer, proxy contest or similar transaction. These provisions are intended to protect our shareholders by providing a measure of assurance that our shareholders will be treated fairly in the event of an unsolicited takeover bid and by preventing a successful takeover bidder from exercising its voting control to the detriment of other shareholders. However, these provisions, taken as a whole, may also discourage a hostile tender offer, exchange offer, proxy solicitation or similar transaction relating to the our common stock, even if the accomplishment of a given transaction may be favorable to the interests of shareholders.\nThe ability of a third party to acquire us is also limited under applicable banking regulations. The BHCA requires any \"bank holding company\" (as defined in the BHCA) to obtain Federal Reserve Board approval prior to acquiring more than 5% of our outstanding common stock. Any person other than a bank holding company is required to obtain prior Federal Reserve Board approval to acquire 10% or more of our outstanding common stock under the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978 and, under certain circumstances, such approvals are required at an even lower ownership percentage. Any holder of 25% or more of our outstanding common stock, other than an individual, is subject to regulation as a bank holding company under the BHCA. While these provisions do not prohibit an acquisition, they would likely act as deterrents to an unsolicited takeover attempt.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS.\nNegative publicity could damage our reputation and business.\nReputation risk, or the risk to our earnings and capital from negative public opinion, is inherent in our business. Negative public opinion could result from our actual, alleged or perceived conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, litigation, regulatory compliance, mergers and acquisitions, disclosure, sharing or inadequate protection of customer information, ESG practices and disclosures as well as from actions taken by government agencies and community organizations in response to that conduct. In addition, unfavorable public opinion regarding the broader financial services industry, or arising from the actions of individual financial institutions, can have an adverse effect on our reputation. Because we conduct our businesses under the \"Fulton\" brand, negative public opinion about one line of business could affect our other lines of businesses. Further, the increased use of social media platforms facilitates the rapid and widespread dissemination of information, including inaccurate, misleading, or false information that could magnify the potential harm to our reputation. Any of these or other events that impair our reputation could affect our ability to attract and retain customers and employees and access sources of funding and capital that could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur internal controls may be ineffective.\nOne critical component of our risk management framework is our system of internal controls. Management regularly reviews and updates our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the controls are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation. See Item 9A. \"Controls and Procedures.\"\nWe may not be able to attract and retain skilled people.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain skilled people. Competition for talented personnel in most activities we engage in can be intense, and we may not be able to hire sufficiently skilled people or to retain them. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills, knowledge of our markets, years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.\nA downgrade in our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on us.\nMoody's Investors Service, Inc. and DBRS, Inc. continuously evaluate us, and their ratings of our long-term and short-term debt and preferred stock are based on a number of factors, including financial strength as well as factors not entirely within our control, such as conditions affecting the financial services industry generally. In light of these reviews and the continued focus on the financial services industry generally, we may not be able to maintain our current ratings. Ratings downgrades by any of these credit rating agencies could have a significant and immediate impact our funding and liquidity through cash obligations, reduced funding capacity and collateral triggers. A reduction in our credit ratings could also increase our borrowing costs and limit their access to the capital markets.\nDowngrades in the credit or financial strength ratings assigned to the counterparties with whom we transact could create the perception that our financial condition will be adversely impacted as a result of potential future defaults by such counterparties. Additionally, we could be adversely affected by a general, negative perception of financial institutions caused by the downgrade of other financial institutions. Accordingly, ratings downgrades of other financial institutions could affect the market price of our common and preferred stock and could limit our access to capital or increase our cost of capital.\nOur future growth may require us to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed or may be available only at an excessive cost.\nWe are required by regulatory agencies to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. We anticipate that current capital levels will satisfy regulatory requirements for the foreseeable future. We, however, may at some point choose to raise additional capital to support future growth. Our ability to raise additional capital will depend, in part, on conditions in the financial markets at that time that are outside of our control. Accordingly, we may be unable to raise additional capital, if and when needed, on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nIf the we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our ability to expand operations through internal growth and acquisitions could be materially impacted.", "PERMNO": 88197, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FULT"}
