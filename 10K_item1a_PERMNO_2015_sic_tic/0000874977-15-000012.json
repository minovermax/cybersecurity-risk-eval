{"cik": "874977", "company": "State Auto Financial CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-03", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nStatements contained in this Form 10-K may be \u201cforward-looking\u201d within the meaning of Section 21E of the Exchange Act. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our operating results to differ materially from those projected. The following factors, among others, in some cases have affected, and in the future could affect, our actual financial performance. If any risks or uncertainties discussed below develop into actual events, then such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, liquidity, capital resources, financial position or results of operations. In that case, the market price of our stock could decline materially.\nIn the discussion below, we have organized risks according to categories of risk factors; however, many of the risks may have correlations and ramifications in more than one category. For example, the timely availability of sufficient, reliable data and information is included in Underwriting and Pricing, yet may also affect a number of risk factor categories. The categories, therefore, should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks we face, not as a limitation on the potential impact of risks.\nThe risk factors might affect, alter, or change actions we take in developing or executing our strategies, including, but not limited to capital management. We employ a number of risk management approaches to reduce our exposure to risk, all of which have inherent limitations. The failure of our risk management actions could have material adverse effects on our business, reputation, liquidity, capital resources, financial position or results of operations.\nThe following list of risk factors is not exhaustive and others may exist or develop. This information should be carefully considered together with the other information included in this report and in other reports and materials we file with the SEC, as well as news releases and other information we publicly disseminate from time to time.\nRESERVES\nIf our estimated liability for losses and loss expenses is incorrect, our loss reserves may be inadequate to cover our ultimate liability for losses and loss expenses and may have to be increased.\nWe establish loss reserves based on actuarial estimates of the amount to be paid in the future to settle all claims incurred as of the end of the accounting period. We maintain loss reserves to cover our estimated ultimate unpaid liability for losses and loss expenses with respect to reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each accounting period. Loss reserves do not represent an exact calculation of the liability, but instead represent estimates, generally using actuarial projection techniques at a given accounting date. Our loss reserve estimates are expectations of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost based on our assessment of facts and circumstances then known, historical settlement patterns, estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency, legal theories of liability and other factors. Variables in the loss reserve estimation process can be affected by both internal and external events, such as changes in claims handling procedures, trends in loss costs, economic inflation, legal developments and legislative changes. Many of these items are not directly quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis. Additionally, there may be a significant reporting lag, or changes in the report lag, between the occurrence of an insured event and the time a claim is actually reported to us. We refine loss reserve estimates in a regular, ongoing process as historical loss experience develops and additional claims are reported and settled. We record adjustments to loss reserves in the results of operations for the periods in which the estimates are changed. In establishing loss reserves, we take into account estimated recoveries for reinsurance, salvage and subrogation.\nBecause estimating loss reserves is an inherently uncertain process, currently established loss reserves may not be adequate. If we conclude the estimates are incorrect and our loss reserves are inadequate, we are obligated to increase them. An increase in loss reserves results in an increase in losses, reducing our net income for the period in which the deficiency is identified. Accordingly, an increase in loss reserves could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nCATASTROPHE LOSSES AND GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATIONS\nThe occurrence of catastrophic events could cause volatility in our results of operations and could materially reduce our level of profitability and adversely affect our liquidity and financial position.\nOur insurance operations expose us to claims arising out of catastrophic events. We have experienced, and will in the future experience, catastrophe losses that may cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially reduce our level of profitability or harm our financial condition, which in turn could adversely affect our ability to write new business. Catastrophes can be caused by various natural events, including hurricanes, hailstorms, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, severe winter weather, fires and man-made events, none of which are within our control. Catastrophe losses can vary widely and could significantly impact our results. The frequency and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. Additionally, catastrophe losses incurred by residual markets or pooling mechanisms (such as wind pools) in certain states could\ntrigger assessments to us. Such assessments could be material and may not be recoupable, depending on the applicable state mechanism.\nThe magnitude of loss from a catastrophe is a function of the severity of the event and the total amount of insured exposure in the affected area. Accordingly, we can sustain significant losses from less severe catastrophes, such as localized windstorms, when they affect areas where our insured exposure is concentrated. Although catastrophes can cause losses in a variety of our property and casualty lines, most of our catastrophe claims in the past have related to homeowners, allied lines, commercial property and commercial multi-peril coverages. The geographic distribution of our business subjects us to catastrophe exposure from severe thunderstorms, tornadoes and hail, as well as earthquakes and hurricanes affecting the United States. Our 2014 and 2013 results reflected decreases in weather-related catastrophe losses when compared to 2012; however, there can be no assurance that a favorable trend will continue in future years. In 2012, the largest catastrophe or series of catastrophes affecting STFC's results of operations were as follows: in 2012, losses related to wind and hail activity from a tornado in March, wind and hail activity in Louisville, Kentucky, and St. Louis, Missouri, in April, and wind activity from a storm in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic states in June resulted in approximately $50.5 million in pre-tax losses.\nIncreases in the value and geographic concentration of insured properties and the effects of inflation could increase the severity of claims from catastrophic events in the future. In addition, states have from time to time passed legislation that limits the ability of insurers to manage catastrophe risk, such as legislation prohibiting insurers from withdrawing from catastrophe-prone areas or refusing to enforce policy provisions such as hurricane deductibles. Although we attempt to reduce the impact of catastrophes on our business by controlling concentrations of exposures in catastrophe prone areas and through the purchase of reinsurance, such reinsurance may prove inadequate if a major catastrophic loss exceeds the reinsurance limit, or we incur a number of smaller catastrophes that, individually, fall below the reinsurance retention level.\nAlong with others in the industry, we utilize catastrophe models developed by third party vendors to help assess and manage our exposure to catastrophe losses. Such models assume various conditions and probability scenarios and use historical information about catastrophic events, along with detailed information about our business. While we use modeling information in connection with our pricing and risk management activities, there are limitations with respect to the models\u2019 usefulness in predicting losses in any reporting period. Such limitations are evidenced by the occurrence of significant variations in estimates between models and modelers; material increases or decreases in model results due to changes and refinements of the underlying data elements and assumptions; and differences observed between the results of actual event conditions and modeled expectations. Climate change, to the extent it affects changes in weather patterns, could impact the frequency or severity of weather events. Some industry commentators have expressed concerns that hydraulic fracturing or \u201cfracking,\u201d a process which involves drilling deep underground wells and injecting water, chemicals and sand into the rock formations in order to extract oil and gas, may cause seismic activity which, among other things, may affect the frequency of earthquakes. We view fracking as a potential emerging risk facing the industry.\nOur ongoing catastrophe management efforts could negatively impact growth to the extent constraints on property exposures are deemed necessary in certain territories. In addition, due to the potential impact on cross-selling opportunities, new business growth in auto or other lines of business could be negatively affected.\nA severe catastrophic event, pandemic or terrorist attack somewhere in the world may not result in material insurance losses to us. However, our investment portfolio, reinsurers or the general economy could be negatively affected, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, capital resources, financial position or results of operations.\nUNDERWRITING AND PRICING\nOur financial results depend primarily on our ability to underwrite risks effectively and to charge adequate rates to policyholders.\nOur financial condition, cash flows and results of operations depend on our ability to underwrite and set rates adequately for a full spectrum of risks, across a number of lines of insurance. Rate adequacy is necessary to generate sufficient premium to pay losses, loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses and to earn a profit.\nOur ability to underwrite and set rates effectively is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nthe timely availability of sufficient, reliable data;\n\u2022\nour ability to conduct a complete and accurate analysis of available data;\n\u2022\nour ability to timely recognize changes in trends and to project both the severity and frequency of losses with reasonable accuracy;\n\u2022\nuncertainties which are generally inherent in estimates and assumptions;\n\u2022\nour ability to project changes in certain operating expense levels with reasonable accuracy;\n\u2022\nthe development, selection and application of appropriate rating formulae or other pricing methodologies;\n\u2022\nour use of predictive modeling or other underwriting tools to assist with correctly and consistently achieving the intended results in underwriting and pricing;\n\u2022\nour ability to establish and consistently follow company underwriting guidelines;\n\u2022\nour ability to innovate with new product and/or pricing strategies, and the success of those innovations on implementation;\n\u2022\nour ability to secure regulatory approval of premium rates on an adequate and timely basis and effectively implement such rate changes;\n\u2022\nour ability to accurately predict consumer behavior, such as policyholder retention;\n\u2022\nunanticipated court decisions, legislation or regulatory action;\n\u2022\nunanticipated changes or execution problems in our claim settlement practices, including our ability to recognize and respond to fraudulent or inflated claims;\n\u2022\nchanging driving patterns for auto exposures; changing weather patterns (including those which may be related to climate change) for property exposures;\n\u2022\ntechnological innovations in automobiles, such as accident avoidance systems and advances leading to autonomous cars;\n\u2022\nchanges in the medical sector of the economy; including healthcare reform cost shifting and other factors;\n\u2022\nunanticipated changes in auto repair costs, auto parts prices and used car prices;\n\u2022\nimpact of inflation and other factors, such as demand surge on cost of construction materials, labor and other expenditures;\n\u2022\nour ability to monitor and manage property concentration in catastrophe prone areas, such as hurricane, earthquake and wind/hail regions; and\n\u2022\nthe general state of the economy in the states in which we operate.\nSuch risks may result in our rates being based on inadequate or inaccurate data or inappropriate assumptions or methodologies, and may cause our estimates of future changes in the frequency or severity of claims to be incorrect. As a result, we could underprice risks, which would negatively affect our margins, or we could overprice risks, which could reduce our competitiveness. In either event, our operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nCREDIT AND FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATINGS\nA downgrade in our financial strength ratings may negatively affect our business and reputation and a downgrade in our credit rating could negatively affect the cost and availability of debt financing.\nInsurance companies are subject to financial strength ratings produced by external rating agencies. Higher ratings generally indicate financial stability and a strong ability to pay claims. Ratings are assigned by rating agencies to insurers based upon factors that they believe are relevant to policyholders and creditors. Ratings are important to maintaining public confidence in our Company and in our ability to market our products. A downgrade in our financial strength ratings could, among other things, negatively affect our ability to sell certain insurance products, our relationships with agents and our ability to compete.\nAlthough other agencies cover the property and casualty industry, we believe our ability to write business is most influenced by our rating from A.M. Best. According to A.M. Best, its ratings are designed to assess an insurer\u2019s financial strength and ability to meet ongoing obligations to policyholders. The State Auto Group\u2019s current financial strength rating from A.M. Best is A (Excellent) with a negative outlook. The State Auto Group\u2019s current financial strength rating from Moody\u2019s is A3 with an under review for downgrade outlook and from Standard & Poor\u2019s is BBB+ with a negative outlook.\nGenerally, credit ratings affect the cost, type and availability of debt financing. Higher rated securities receive more favorable pricing and terms relative to lower rated securities at the time of issue. The State Auto Group\u2019s current credit rating from A.M. Best is bbb with a negative outlook. The State Auto Group\u2019s current credit rating from Standard & Poor\u2019s BB+ with a negative outlook.\nDepending on future results and developments, we may not be able to maintain our current ratings.\nDIVIDENDS\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to pay cash dividends consistent with current or past levels.\nWe have a history of consistently paying cash dividends to our shareholders. In the fourth quarter of 2012, the Board of Directors of State Auto Financial reduced the amount of dividends paid on our common shares from $0.15 per share to $0.10 per share; however, the future payment of cash dividends will depend upon a variety of factors, such as our results of operations, financial condition and cash requirements, as well as the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to make distributions to STFC. State insurance laws restrict the payment of dividends by insurance companies to their shareholders. In addition, competitive pressures generally require insurance companies to maintain insurance financial strength ratings. Such restrictions and other requirements and factors may affect the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to make dividend payments to STFC. Limits on the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends could adversely affect STFC's liquidity, including STFC's ability to pay cash dividends to shareholders.\nTECHNOLOGY AND TELECOMMUNICATION SYSTEMS\nOur business success and profitability depend, in part, on effective information technology and telecommunication systems. If we are unable to keep pace with the rapidly developing technological advancements in the insurance industry, our ability to compete effectively could be impaired.\nWe depend in large part on our technology and telecommunication systems for conducting business and processing claims. Our business success is dependent on maintaining the effectiveness of existing technology and telecommunication systems and on their continued development and enhancement to support our business processes and strategic initiatives in a cost effective manner. We implemented a new claims system for most lines of business during 2013. This initiative involved a significant commitment of resources. This new system is intended to add functionality and increase our claims efficiency with improved file quality. However, there can be no certainty that all such intended benefits will be fully realized.\nAn ongoing challenge during system development and enhancement is the effective and efficient utilization of our current technology in view of a constantly changing technological landscape. There can be no assurance that the development of current technology for future use will not result in our being competitively disadvantaged, especially with those carriers that have greater resources. If we are unable to keep pace with the advancements being made in technology, our ability to compete with other insurance companies who have advanced technological capabilities will be negatively affected. Further, if we are unable to effectively execute and update or replace our key legacy technology and telecommunication systems as they become obsolete or as emerging technology renders them competitively inefficient, our competitive position and/or cost structure could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to effectively execute our top initiatives and projects, we may not meet organizational objectives due to cost overruns, missed project milestones, defects and/or failing to deliver the desired business value.\nSystem implementations are complex processes requiring extensive planning and coordination among multiple stakeholder groups. During 2013, we began planning a multi-year business and technology transition to consolidate all of our policy administration and billing systems. The transition is not expected to be complete for several years. For this initiative, we are partnering with a third party which specializes in providing core system software to the insurance industry. The new technology platform is intended to provide us with quicker speed to market, improve ease of doing business for our policyholders, agents and brokers, lower our costs for maintenance and product introductions and provide greater operational efficiency. However, even with our best planning and efforts and the involvement of third party expertise, there can be no assurance that the expected benefits will be realized upon implementation or that the transition will be completed within the planned time frame or budget. Such risks are also present in other key initiatives and projects planned for 2015 and beyond.\nIf we experience difficulties with outsourcing, or other third party relationships, our ability to conduct business might be negatively impacted.\nDuring 2014, we transitioned the support and maintenance of information technology legacy systems to a third party vendor. This decision was designed to advance our application and support capabilities, while delivering an improved customer experience. However, there can be no assurance that these desired objectives will be achieved. If the third party provider fails to perform as expected, we may experience operational difficulties, service problems or increased costs.\nFrom time to time we may outsource certain other business, information technology or administrative functions, or otherwise rely on certain third parties for the performance of such functions, for efficiency and cost saving purposes. If we fail to develop and implement our sourcing strategies or our third party providers fail to perform as expected, we may experience operational difficulties, increased costs, and a loss of business that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nVENDOR MANAGEMENT\nLoss of key vendor relationships or failure of a vendor to perform as anticipated or to protect personal information of our customers, claimants or employees could negatively affect our operations.\nWe rely on services and products provided by various vendors. In the event that one or more of our vendors becomes unable to continue to provide products or services as anticipated, we may suffer operational impairment and financial loss. If one or more of our vendors fail to protect personal information of our customers, claimants or employees, we may incur operational impairments, or could be exposed to litigation, compliance costs or reputation damage.\nCYBER-SECURITY THREATS\nOur highly automated and networked organization is subject to cyber-terrorism and a variety of other cyber-security threats. These threats come in a variety of forms, such as viruses and malicious software. Such threats can be difficult to prevent or detect, and if experienced, could interrupt or damage our operations, harm our reputation or have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nOur technology and telecommunications systems are highly integrated and connected with other networks. Cyber-attacks involving these systems could be carried out remotely and from multiple sources and could interrupt, damage or otherwise adversely affect the operations of these critical systems. Cyber-attacks could result in the modification or theft of data, the distribution of false information or the denial of service to users. We obtain, utilize and maintain data concerning individuals and organizations with which we have a business relationship. Threats to data security can emerge from a variety of sources and change in rapid fashion, resulting in the ongoing need to expend resources to secure our data in accordance with customer expectations and statutory and regulatory requirements.\nWe could be subject to liability if confidential customer information is misappropriated from our technology systems. Despite the implementation of security measures, these systems may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses, programming errors, attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems. Any well-publicized compromise of security could deter people from entering into transactions that involve transmitting confidential information to our systems, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation.\nWe rely on services and products provided by many vendors. In the event that one or more of our vendors fails to protect personal information of our customers, claimants or employees, we may incur operational impairments, or could be exposed to litigation, compliance costs or reputational damage.\nWhile we have not experienced material cyber-incidents to date, the occurrence and effects of cyber-incidents may remain undetected for an extended period. We maintain cyber-liability insurance coverage to offset certain potential losses, subject to policy limits, such as liability to others, costs of related crisis management, data extortion, applicable forensics and certain regulatory defense costs, fines and penalties.\nBUSINESS CONTINUITY\nOur business depends on the uninterrupted operation of our facilities, systems and business functions, including our information technology, telecommunications and other business systems. Our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not sufficiently address all contingencies.\nOur business is highly dependent upon our ability to execute, in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion, necessary business functions, such as Internet support and 24-hour claims contact centers, processing new and renewal business, receiving and\nprocessing payment receipts and processing and paying claims. A shut-down of or inability to access one or more of our facilities, power outages, a major failure of the Internet, a pandemic, or a failure of one or more of our information technology, telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis. In addition, because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity, or if our system or a third party system fails or experiences an interruption. If sustained or repeated, such a business interruption, systems failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business, provide customer service, receive premium payments, pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary corporate functions. This could result in a materially adverse effect on our business results and liquidity and may cause reputational damage.\nWe have established a business continuity plan that is designed to continue our core business operations in the event that normal business operations cannot be performed due to a catastrophic event. While we continue to test and assess our business continuity plan to meet the needs of our core business operations and address multiple business interruption events, there is no assurance that we will be able to perform our core business operations upon the occurrence of such an event, which may result in a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial position and results of operations.\nREINSURANCE\nReinsurance may not be available, collectible or adequate to protect us against losses, or may cause us to constrain the amount of business we underwrite in certain lines of business and locations.\nWe use reinsurance to help manage our exposure to insurance risks and to manage our capital. There can be no assurance that our use of reinsurance effectively meets our strategic business objectives. The availability, policy conditions and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing market conditions, which can affect our business volume and profitability. Although the reinsurer is liable to us to the extent of the ceded reinsurance, we remain liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured. Ceded reinsurance arrangements do not eliminate our obligation to pay claims. As a result, we are subject to counterparty risk with respect to our ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers. Reinsurance may not be adequate to protect us against losses and may not be available to us in the future at commercially reasonable rates. In addition, the magnitude of losses in the reinsurance industry resulting from catastrophes may adversely affect the financial strength of certain reinsurers, which may result in our inability to collect or recover reinsurance. Reinsurers also may reserve their right to dispute coverage with respect to specific claims. With respect to catastrophic or other loss, if we experience difficulty collecting from reinsurers or obtaining additional reinsurance in the future, we will bear a greater portion of the total financial responsibility for such loss, which could materially reduce our profitability or harm our liquidity and financial condition.\nAs described in more detail elsewhere in this Form 10-K, the State Auto Group entered into a one-year property aggregate excess catastrophe reinsurance agreement, effective January 1, 2015, with a syndicate of reinsurers covering property business underwritten by our personal insurance and business insurance segments. This reinsurance agreement excludes property risks underwritten by our specialty insurance segment. This reinsurance agreement replaces the homeowner quota share reinsurance agreement that had been in place for the prior three years. Under that quota share reinsurance agreement, which expired in accordance with its terms on December 31, 2014, we had ceded to reinsurers 75% of our homeowner business during the term of the agreement.\nThe one-year property aggregate excess catastrophe reinsurance agreement provides reinsurance coverage to the State Auto Group of $75.0 million during 2015 for the ISO's PCS numbered catastrophes and certain other weather-related events after the State Auto Group's retention of $165.0 million. Individual occurrences are not subject to an occurrence deductible, but are subject to a maximum amount of $55.0 million consistent with the Group's retention under the existing property catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance agreement.\nAs described in more detail elsewhere in this Form 10-K, the State Auto Group entered into an ADC reinsurance agreement to protect against adverse development of loss and ALAE reserves for the terminated RED restaurant program. The ADC reinsurance agreement provides the State Auto Group with $40.0 million of adverse development cover in excess of the carried reserves for the terminated RED restaurant program at December 31, 2014.\nCYCLICAL NATURE OF THE INDUSTRY\nThe property and casualty insurance industry is cyclical, which may cause fluctuations in our operating results.\nThe property and casualty insurance industry, particularly business insurance, has been historically characterized by periods of intense price competition due to excess underwriting capacity, as well as periods of shortages of underwriting capacity that result in higher prices and more restrictive contract and/or coverage terms. The periods of intense price competition may adversely affect our operating results, and the overall cyclicality of the industry may cause fluctuations in our operating results. While we\nmay adjust prices during periods of intense competition, it remains our strategy to allow for acceptable profit levels and to decline coverage in situations where pricing or risk would not result in acceptable expected returns. Accordingly, our commercial and specialty lines of business tend to contract during periods of severe competition and price declines and expand when market pricing allows an acceptable return. This can cause volatility in our premium revenues. Our specialty insurance segment markets and underwrites commercial exposures through wholesale brokers, program administrators and other specialty sources. The reaction of these distribution channels to price competition may result in the movement of business and volatility of premium revenues.\nThe personal lines businesses are characterized by an automated underwriting cycle of loss cost trends. Driving patterns, inflation in the cost of auto repairs and medical care and increasing litigation of liability claims are some of the more important factors that affect loss cost trends. Inflation in the cost of building materials and labor costs and demand caused by weather-related catastrophic events affect personal lines homeowners loss cost trends. We may be unable to increase premiums at the same pace as coverage costs increase. Accordingly, profit margins initially decline in periods of increasing loss costs.\nECONOMIC CONDITIONS\nEconomic conditions may adversely affect our business.\nThe current challenging national and global economy, as well as negative economic conditions in the future, may adversely impact our business and results of operations. While the volatility of the economic climate makes it difficult for us to predict the overall impact of economic conditions on our business and results of operations, our business may be impacted in a variety of ways.\nEconomic conditions affect consumer behavior. For example, a decrease in gas prices may result in consumers driving more miles, leading to a possible increase in auto claim frequency. Negative economic conditions may cause consumers and businesses to decrease their spending, which may impact the demand for insurance products. For example, declining automotive sales and weaknesses in the housing market generally impact the purchase of our personal auto and homeowners insurance products by consumers and business insurance products by businesses involved in these industries. High levels of unemployment have a tendency to cause the number of workers\u2019 compensation claims to increase, as laid-off and unemployed workers may seek workers\u2019 compensation benefits to replace their lost healthcare benefits. Similarly, uninsured and underinsured motorist claims may rise. Vacated homes and business properties pose increased insurance industry risk.\nVolatility and weakness in the financial and capital markets may negatively impact the value of our investment portfolio. Economic strains on states and municipalities could result in downgrades or defaults of certain municipal obligations.\nWe may be adversely affected by business difficulties, bankruptcies and impairments of other parties with whom we do business, such as independent agents, key vendors and suppliers, reinsurers or banks, which increases our credit risk and other counterparty risks. Bankruptcies among our current business insurance customers can negatively affect our retention. Reductions in new business start-ups may negatively affect the number of future potential business insurance customers.\nIn response to economic conditions, the United States federal government and other governmental and regulatory bodies have taken action and may take additional actions to address such conditions. There can be no assurance as to what impact such actions or future actions will have on the financial markets, economic conditions or our Company.\nIn addition, government spending and monetary policies or other factors may cause the rate of inflation to increase in the future. Inflation can have a significant negative impact on property and casualty insurers because premium rates are established before the amount of losses and loss expenses are known. When establishing rates, we attempt to anticipate increases from inflation subject to the limitations of modeling economic variables. Premium rates may prove to be inadequate due to low trend assumptions arising from the use of historical data. Even when general inflation is relatively modest, price inflation on the goods and services purchased by insurance companies in settling claims can steadily increase. Reserves may develop adversely and become inadequate. Retentions and deductibles may be exhausted more quickly. Interest rate increases in an inflationary environment could cause the values of our fixed income investments to decline.\nAdverse capital and credit market conditions may negatively affect our ability to meet unexpected liquidity needs or to obtain credit on acceptable terms.\nIn the event that we need access to additional capital to pay our operating expenses, make payments on our indebtedness, pay for capital expenditures or fund acquisitions, our ability to obtain such capital may be constrained and the cost of any such capital may be significant. Our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on numerous factors, such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to our industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity, as well as lenders\u2019 perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects. Our access to funds may also be constrained if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions. If certain factors were to occur, our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient and we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on satisfactory terms.\nDISTRIBUTION SYSTEM\nOur retail agents, who are part of the independent agency distribution channel, are our sole distribution method for our personal and business insurance segments. Our exclusive use of such distribution may constrain our ability to grow at a comparable pace to our competitors that utilize multiple distribution channels. In addition, consumers may prefer to purchase insurance products through other means, such as the internet, rather than through agents.\nWe market our insurance products in our personal and business insurance segments exclusively through independent, non-exclusive insurance agents and brokers, whereas some of our competitors sell their insurance products through direct marketing techniques, the internet or \u201ccaptive\u201d insurance agents who sell products exclusively for one insurance company. Throughout its history, the State Auto Group has supported the independent agency system as our distribution channel. However, we recognize that although the number of distribution locations has expanded and the size of many agencies has grown, the number of individual independent agencies in the industry has dramatically shrunk over the past decade due to agency purchases, consolidations, bankruptcies and agent retirements. We also recognize that it will be progressively more difficult to expand the number of independent agencies representing us. If we are unsuccessful in maintaining and increasing our agency representation, our sales and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe retail agents that market and sell our products also sell products of our competitors. These agents may recommend our competitors\u2019 products over our products or may stop selling our products altogether. When price competition is intense, our premium production may be negatively impacted by the fact our independent agent distribution force has products to sell from other carriers that may be more willing to lower prices to grow top line sales. Consequently, we must remain focused on attracting and partnering with agents to market and sell our products. We compete for productive agents primarily on the basis of our financial position, support services, ease of doing business, compensation and product features. Although we make efforts to ensure we have strong relationships with our retail agents, we may not be successful and our sales and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, consumers are increasingly using the internet and other alternative channels to purchase insurance products. While our website provides a significant amount of information about our insurance products, consumers cannot purchase insurance through our website. Instead, consumers must contact one of our independent agents to purchase our insurance products or make changes to their policies. This single distribution system may place us at a disadvantage with consumers who prefer to purchase insurance products online or through other alternative distribution channels.\nBecause our specialty insurance segment business is dependent upon wholesale brokers, managing general agents and retail agents, we are exposed to certain risks arising out of these distribution channels that could cause our results to be adversely affected.\nWe market and distribute our specialty insurance segment products through wholesale agents and managing general agents to whom we have granted quoting and binding authority and who, in turn, sell our insurance products to insureds through retail insurance brokers. While we have established and provided these wholesale agents and managing general agents with pre-established underwriting guidelines, if they fail to comply with our underwriting guidelines and the terms of their appointment, we could be bound on a particular risk or number of risks that were not anticipated when we developed the insurance products. Such actions could adversely affect our results of operations.\nAdditionally, in any given period we may derive a significant portion of our business from a limited number of agents and brokers and the loss of any of these relationships could have a significant impact on our ability to market our products and services. Likewise, in certain jurisdictions, when the insured remits premium payments to our agent or broker in full, our premiums are considered to have been paid in full, notwithstanding that we may or may not have actually received the premiums from the agent or broker. Consequently, we assume a degree of credit risk associated with certain agents and brokers with whom we transact business.\nREGULATION\nOur business is heavily regulated, and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and limit our growth.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation in the states in which we conduct business. This regulation is generally designed to protect the interests of policyholders, as opposed to shareholders and other investors, and relates to authorization for lines of business, capital and surplus requirements, investment limitations, underwriting limitations, transactions with affiliates, dividend limitations (see \u201cRegulation-Dividends\u201d in Item 1), changes in control, premium rates and a variety of other financial and non-financial components of an insurance company\u2019s business. The NAIC and state insurance regulators are constantly examining laws and regulations, generally focusing on modifications to holding company regulations, interpreting existing laws and developing new laws.\nFrom time to time, some states in which we conduct business have considered or enacted laws that may alter or increase state authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding companies. In other situations, states in which we conduct business have considered or enacted laws that impact the competitive environment and marketplace for property and casualty insurance.\nNearly all states require licensed insurers to participate in guaranty funds through assessments covering a portion of insurance claims against impaired or insolvent insurers. An increase in the magnitude of impaired companies could result in an increase in our share of such assessments. Residual market or pooling arrangements exist in many states to provide certain types of insurance coverage to those that are otherwise unable to find private insurers willing to insure them. Licensed insurers voluntarily writing such coverage are required to participate in these residual markets or pooling mechanisms. Such participation exposes us to possible assessments, some of which could be material to our results of operations. The potential availability of recoupments or premium rate increases, if applicable, may not offset such assessments in the financial statements nor do so in the same fiscal periods.\nFrom time to time, many of the states in which we operate consider legislation restricting or banning the use of credit scoring in rating and/or risk selection in personal lines of business. Similarly, several states have considered restricting insurers\u2019 rights to use loss history information maintained in various databases by insurance support organizations. These tools help us price our products more fairly and enhance our ability to compete for business that we believe will be profitable. Such regulations would limit our ability, as well as the ability of all other insurance carriers operating in any affected jurisdiction, to take advantage of these tools.\nCurrently the federal government does not directly regulate the insurance business. However, in recent years the state insurance regulatory framework has come under increased federal scrutiny. Congress and some federal agencies from time to time investigate the current condition of insurance regulation in the United States to determine whether to impose federal regulation or to allow an optional federal charter, similar to banks. In addition, changes in federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas, including changes in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, financial services regulation and federal taxation, or repeal of McCarran-Ferguson Act (which largely exempts the insurance industry from the federal antitrust laws), could significantly impact the insurance industry and us. In February 2013, the Department of Housing and Urban Development finalized a federal regulation introducing disparate impact criteria to the sale of homeowners insurance. Such regulation may have a negative effect on our underwriting and pricing of homeowners insurance, as it puts in jeopardy the use of longstanding, sound actuarial factors. We are continuing to monitor the impact of this legislation.\nThe Federal Insurance Office was established in 2010 by the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Federal Insurance Office is a separate office within the United States Department of Treasury. The primary objective of the Federal Insurance Office is to monitor all aspects of the insurance industry. The Federal Insurance Office also coordinates and develops federal policy on international insurance matters, including representing the United States in the International Association of Insurance Supervisors, assists in negotiating certain international agreements, monitors access to affordable insurance by traditionally underserved communities and consumers, minorities, and low- and moderate-income persons, and assists in the administration of the terrorism risk insurance program. However, the Federal Insurance Office lacks regulatory authority, and it is not clear how this federal office will coordinate and interact with the NAIC or state insurance regulators. In December 2013, the Federal Insurance Office issued a report on regulatory modernization. The report concluded that the regulatory debate at present is not whether insurance regulation should be state-based or regulated by the federal government, but, whether there are areas in which the federal government's involvement in regulation under the state-based approach would be beneficial. The report recommended 18 areas for short-term insurance regulation improvement, centering around capital adequacy, reform of insurer resolution practices and marketplace regulation, and nine areas of direct federal government involvement in regulation. Industry response to the report has been mixed. It is uncertain what regulatory changes may ultimately result from the report and what impact such changes may have on the industry and to us.\nAlthough we do not write health insurance, rules affecting health care services can affect insurance we write, including workers\u2019 compensation, commercial and personal automobile and liability insurance. The enactment of the Patient Protection and\nAffordable Care Act of 2010 (the \u201cHealthcare Act\u201d) and additional health care reform legislation may have an impact on various aspects of our business. In addition, we may be impacted as a business enterprise by potential tax issues and changes in employee benefits. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact of health care legislation or regulations, or changing interpretations, at the federal or state levels.\nWe cannot predict with certainty the effect any enacted, proposed or future state or federal regulation or NAIC initiatives may have on the conduct of our business. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the regulatory requirements applicable to our business will not become more stringent in the future or result in materially higher costs than current requirements. For example, concerns over climate change may prompt federal, state or local laws intended to protect the environment. Changes in the regulation of our business may reduce our profitability, limit our growth or otherwise adversely affect our operations.\nWe could be adversely affected if our controls designed to assure compliance with guidelines, policies, and legal and regulatory standards, including financial and regulatory reporting, are ineffective. Our business is dependent on our ability to regularly engage in a large number of insurance underwriting, claim processing, personnel and human resources, and investment activities, many of which are complex. These activities often are subject to internal guidelines and policies, as well as legal and regulatory requirements. No matter how well designed and executed, control systems provide only reasonable assurance that the system objectives will be met. If our controls are not effective, it could lead to financial loss, unexpected risk exposures or damage to our reputation.\nTax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the United States federal, state and local governments. Tax legislative initiatives by these governmental bodies, including actions by departments of insurance, taxing authorities and other state and local agencies, to change the current tax structure or to increase taxes, assessments and other revenue-generating fees may increase the cost of doing business in those jurisdictions.\nFrom time to time, various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions. There can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these initiatives. In addition, United States federal, state and local tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. There can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge.\nCLAIM AND COVERAGE DEVELOPMENTS\nDeveloping claim and coverage issues in our industry are uncertain and may adversely affect our insurance operations.\nAs industry practices and legislative, judicial and regulatory conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may develop. These issues could have an adverse effect on our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the frequency or severity of claims. The premiums we charge for our insurance products are based upon certain risk expectations. When legislative, judicial or regulatory authorities expand the burden of risk beyond our expectations, the premiums we previously charged or collected may no longer be sufficient to cover the risk, and we do not have the ability to retroactively modify premium amounts. Furthermore, our reserve estimates do not take into consideration a major retroactive expansion of coverage through legislative or regulatory actions or judicial interpretations.\nIn particular, court decisions have had, and are expected to continue to have, significant impact on the property and casualty insurance industry. Court decisions may increase the level of risk which insurers are expected to assume in a number of ways, such as by eliminating exclusions, increasing limits of coverage, creating rights in claimants not intended by the insurer and interpreting applicable statutes expansively to create obligations on insurers not originally considered when the statute was passed. In some cases, court decisions have been applied retroactively. Court decisions have also negated legal reforms passed by state legislatures.\nWe have seen instances of political pressure exerted to force or persuade insurers to provide extra-contractual coverage, such as foregoing the use of deductibles. Such situations may, to some degree, threaten the sanctity of the insurance contract.\nThere is also a growing trend of plaintiffs targeting property and casualty insurers, including us, in putative class action litigation relating to claim-handling and other practices, particularly with respect to the handling of personal lines auto and homeowners claims.\nThere are concerns that the focus on climate change and global warming could affect court decisions or result in litigation, including potential matters arising from federal, state or local laws intended to protect the environment. Other environmental concerns could also create or affect potential liability exposures.\nMany of these issues are beyond our control. The effects of these and other unforeseen claims and coverage issues are extremely hard to predict and could materially harm our business and results of operations.\nLITIGATION\nWe may suffer losses from litigation, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results or cash flows and financial condition.\nAs is typical in our industry, we face risks associated with litigation of various types, including disputes relating to insurance claims under our policies, as well as other general commercial and corporate litigation. Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and in the event of an unfavorable outcome in one or more litigation matters, the ultimate liability may be in excess of amounts currently reserved and may be material to our operating results or cash flows for a particular quarter or annual period and to our financial condition.\nTERRORISM\nTerrorist attacks, and the threat of terrorist attacks, and ensuing events could have an adverse effect on us.\nTerrorism, both within the United States and abroad, and military and other actions and heightened security measures in response to these types of threats, may cause loss of life, property damage, reduced economic activity, and additional disruptions to commerce. Terrorist attacks could cause losses from insurance claims related to the property and casualty insurance operations of the State Auto Group, as well as a decrease in our stockholders\u2019 equity, net income and/or revenue.\nThe Terrorism Acts require the federal government and the insurance industry to share the risk of insured losses on future acts of terrorism that are certified by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury. We are required to participate in the Terrorism Acts as a result of our commercial insurance business. In addition, under the Terrorism Acts, terrorism coverage is mandatory for all primary workers' compensation policies. Insureds with non-workers' compensation commercial policies, however, have the option to accept or decline our terrorism coverage. In 2014, over 90% of our commercial lines non-workers' compensation policyholders purchased terrorism coverage. Although the Terrorism Acts mitigate our exposure to a large-scale terrorist attack, our deductible is substantial and losses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nIn addition, some of the assets in our investment portfolio may be adversely affected by declines in the equity markets and economic activity caused by the continued threat of terrorism, ongoing military and other actions and heightened security measures. We cannot predict at this time the extent to which industry sectors in which we maintain investments may suffer losses as a result of potentially decreased commercial and economic activity, or how any such decrease might impact the ability of companies within the affected industry sectors to pay interest or principal on their securities, or how the value of any underlying collateral might be affected.\nFurthermore, our reinsurers could experience significant losses as a result of terrorist attacks, potentially jeopardizing their ability to pay losses ceded to them and reducing the availability of reinsurance. Our current commercial property reinsurance excludes certified acts of foreign terrorism and loss due to nuclear, biological or chemical agents.\nINVESTMENTS\nThe performance of our investment portfolios is subject to various investment risks, such as market, credit, concentration, liquidity, and interest rate risks. Such risks could result in material adverse effects to our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nLike other property and casualty insurance companies, we depend on income from our investment portfolio for a portion of our revenues and earnings and are therefore subject to market risk, credit risk, concentration risk, liquidity risk and the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in equity, interest, commodity or foreign currency exchange rates and prices. Our primary market risk exposures are to changes in interest rates and equity prices. Continuation of the current low interest rate environment puts downward pressure on investment income. Future increases in interest rates could cause the values of our fixed income portfolios to decline, with the magnitude of the decline depending on the duration of our portfolio. Individual securities in our fixed income portfolio are subject to credit risk and default. Downgrades in the credit ratings of fixed maturities can have a significant negative effect on the market valuation of such securities. For example, budget strains on certain states and local governments could negatively affect the credit quality and ratings of their issued securities.\nOur fixed income portfolio includes certain securities with call features permitting them to be redeemed by the issuers prior to stated maturity. Reinvestment risk exists with such securities as it may not be possible to reinvest the proceeds from the called securities at equivalent yields.\nIf the fixed income or equity portfolios, or both, were to be impaired by market, sector or issuer-specific conditions to a substantial degree, our liquidity, financial position and financial results could be materially adversely affected. Under these circumstances, our income from these investments could be materially reduced, and declines in the value of certain securities could further reduce our reported earnings and capital levels. A decrease in value of our investment portfolio could also put our insurance subsidiaries at risk of failing to satisfy regulatory minimum capital requirements. If we were not at that time able to supplement our subsidiaries\u2019 capital from STFC or by issuing debt or equity securities on acceptable terms, our business could be materially adversely affected. Also, a decline in market rates of fixed income securities or a decline in the fair value of equity securities could cause the investments in our pension plans to decrease, resulting in additional expense and increasing required contributions to the pension plan.\nIn addition, our investments are subject to risks inherent in the nation\u2019s and world\u2019s capital markets. The functioning of those markets, the values of the investments held by us and our ability to liquidate investments on favorable terms or short notice may be adversely affected if those markets are disrupted or otherwise affected by local, national or international events, such as power outages, system failures, wars or terrorist attacks or by recessions or depressions, a significant change in inflation expectations, a significant devaluation of governmental or private sector credit, currencies or financial markets and other factors or events.\nChanges in tax laws impacting marginal tax rates and/or the preferred tax treatment of municipal obligations under current law, could adversely affect the market value of municipal obligations. Since a significant portion of our investment portfolio is invested in tax-exempt municipal obligations, any such changes in tax law could adversely affect the value of the investment portfolio. Additionally, any such changes in tax law could reduce the difference between tax-exempt interest rates and taxable rates.\nEMPLOYEES\nOur ability to attract, develop and retain talented employees, managers and executives, and to maintain appropriate staffing levels, is critical to our success, as is our ability to effectively plan for the succession and transition of key executives and subject matter experts.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract, train, develop and retain talented, ethical, diverse employees, including executives and other key managers in a specialized industry. The loss of certain key officers and employees or the failure to attract and develop talented new executives and managers could have a materially adverse effect on our business. Effective succession planning is important to assure the timely, competent replacement of retiring or transitioning senior executives and other departing management talent and subject matter experts.\nTalent management is a key consideration in our specialty insurance segment, which requires specialized product underwriting, claims handling and risk management services and involves distribution through channels other than our retail agents. Other business units also focus on specialized technical or analytical skills.\nOur success also depends on our ability to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our staff. Our ability to do so may be impaired as a result of a variety of internal and external factors which affect employees and the employment marketplace, as well as our ability to recognize and respond to changing trends and other circumstances that affect our employees. In addition, we must forecast the changing business environments (for multiple business units and in many geographic markets) with reasonable accuracy and adjust hiring programs and/or employment levels accordingly. Our failure to recognize the need for such adjustments, or the failure or inability to react appropriately on a timely basis, could lead either to over-staffing (which would adversely affect our cost structure) or under-staffing (impairing our ability to execute and effectively service our business) in one or more business units or locations. In either event, our financial results could be materially adversely affected.\nCONTROL BY OUR PARENT COMPANY\nState Auto Mutual owns a significant interest in us and may exercise its control in a manner detrimental to your interests.\nAs of December 31, 2014, State Auto Mutual owned approximately 62.5% of the voting power of our Company. Therefore, State Auto Mutual has the power to direct our affairs and is able to determine the outcome of substantially all matters required to be submitted to shareholders for approval, including the election of all our directors. State Auto Mutual could exercise its control over us in a manner detrimental to the interests of other STFC shareholders.\nCOMPETITION\nOur industry is highly competitive, which could adversely affect our sales and profitability.\nThe property and casualty insurance business is highly competitive, and we compete with a large number of other insurers. Many of our competitors have well-established national reputations and brands supported by extensive media advertising. Many\nof our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and operating resources and market share than us. We may not be able to effectively compete, which could adversely affect our sales and profitability. We believe that competition in our lines of business is based primarily on price, service, commission structure, product features, financial strength ratings, producer relationships, reputation and name or brand recognition. Market developments such as usage-based auto insurance or new entrants into the insurance marketplace could potentially result in reduced market share or adverse selection. The growth in mobile communications and the prominence of social media as a source of information for consumers are recent examples of significant developments in the marketplace which may adversely affect our competitive position. Social media, for example, could be potentially utilized in a manner which negatively affects our reputation with current or prospective policyholders and agents.\nOur competitors sell through various distribution channels, including independent agents, captive agents and directly to the consumer. We compete not only for personal and business insurance customers, but also for independent agents and brokers to market and sell our products. Our specialty insurance segment faces competitors attempting to sell their products through the distribution system of wholesale brokers, program administrators and other specialty sources. Some of our competitors offer a broader array of products, have more competitive pricing or have higher claims paying ability ratings. In addition, other financial institutions are now able to offer services similar to our own as a result of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.\nThe increased transparency that arises from information available from the use of tools such as comparative rater software, could work to our disadvantage. The competitive environment for certain lines of business, such as personal auto insurance, puts pressure on achieving sustainable profit margins. We may have difficulty differentiating our products or becoming among the lowest cost providers. Expense efficiencies are important to maintaining and increasing our growth and profitability. If we are unable to efficiently execute and realize future expense efficiencies, it could affect our ability to establish competitive pricing and could have a negative effect on new business growth and retention of existing policyholders.\nVOLATILITY OF OUR COMMON STOCK\nThe price of our common stock could be volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors, some of which may not be related to our operating performance and are beyond our control. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the following: volatility and variations in our actual or anticipated operating results or changes in the expectations of financial market analysts; investor perceptions of our Company and/or the property and casualty industry; the number of shares outstanding, trading volume, market conditions in the insurance industry and any significant volatility in the market; and major catastrophic events.\nCHANGES IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nChanges in accounting standards issued by the FASB or other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, FASB, AICPA and other accounting standard-setting bodies may periodically issue changes to, interpretations of or guidance with respect to GAAP. The adoption of such guidance may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K regarding adoption of recent accounting pronouncements.", "PERMNO": 76722, "SIC": 6331, "TIC": "STFC"}
