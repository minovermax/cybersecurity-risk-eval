{"cik": "723188", "company": "COMMUNITY BANK SYSTEM, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThere are risks inherent in the Company's business. The material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect the Company are described below. Adverse experience with these could have a material impact on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in interest rates affect our profitability, assets and liabilities.\nThe Company's income and cash flow depends to a great extent on the difference between the interest earned on loans and investment securities, and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the Company's control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the FRB. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect (1) our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, which could reduce the amount of fee income generated, (2) the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities and (3) the average duration of the Company's various categories of earning assets. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, our net interest income could be adversely affected, which in turn could negatively affect our earnings. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. Although management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on the results of operations, any substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company operates in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations or the interpretation and examination of existing laws and regulations.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to extensive state and federal regulation, supervision and legislation that govern nearly every aspect of its operations. The Company, as a bank holding company, is subject to regulation by the FRB and its banking subsidiary is subject to regulation by the OCC. These regulations affect deposit and lending practices, capital levels and structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth. In addition, the non-bank subsidiaries are engaged in providing retirement plan administration, investment management and insurance brokerage services, which industries are also heavily regulated at both a state and federal level. Such regulators govern the activities in which the Company and its subsidiaries may engage. These regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on the operation of a bank, the classification of assets by a bank and the adequacy of a bank's allowance for loan losses. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation, interpretation or application, could have a material impact on the Company and its operations. Changes to the regulatory laws governing these businesses could affect the Company's ability to deliver or expand its services and adversely impact its operating and financial condition.\nFor example, the Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, instituted major changes to the banking and financial institutions regulatory regimes based upon the performance of, and ultimate government intervention in, the financial services sector. To date, not all the rules required or expected to be implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act have been adopted and many of the rules that have been adopted are subject to interpretation or clarification. The implications of the Dodd-Frank Act for the Company's businesses continue to depend to a large extent on the implementation of the legislation by the FRB and other agencies as well as how market practices and structures change in response to the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. All of these changes in regulations could subject the Company, among other things, to additional costs and limit the types of financial services and products it can offer and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products.\nThe Company is also directly subject to the requirements of entities that set and interpret the accounting standards such as the Financial Accounting Standards Board, and indirectly subject to the actions and interpretations of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, which establishes auditing and related professional practice standards for registered public accounting firms and inspects registered firms to assess their compliance with certain laws, rules, and professional standards in public company audits. These regulations, along with the currently existing tax, accounting, securities, insurance, and monetary laws, regulations, rules, standards, policies and interpretations, control the methods by which financial institutions and their holding companies conduct business, engage in strategic and tax planning, implement strategic initiatives, and govern financial reporting.\nThe Company's failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in civil or criminal sanctions and money penalties by state and federal agencies, and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. See \"Supervision and Regulation\" for more information about the regulations to which the Company is subject.\nIf the Company's total consolidated assets were to reach $10 billion, it would become subject to additional regulation and increased supervision.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act imposes additional regulatory requirement on institutions with $10 billion or more in assets. The Company had $8.7 billion in assets as of December 31, 2016. The pending merger with Merchants will result in the Company having assets of $10 billion or more and will subject the Company to the following: (1) supervision, examination and enforcement by the CFPB with respect to consumer financial protection laws, (2) regulatory stress testing requirements, whereby the Company would be required to conduct an annual stress test using assumptions for baseline, adverse and severely adverse scenarios, (3) a modified methodology for calculating FDIC insurance assessments and potentially higher assessment rates as a result of institutions with $10 billion or more in assets being required to bear a greater portion of the cost of raising the reserve ratio to 1.35% as required by the Dodd-Frank Act, (4) limitations on interchange fees for debit card transactions, (5) heightened compliance standards under the Volcker Rule, and (6) enhanced supervision as a larger financial institution. The imposition of these regulatory requirements and increased supervision may require additional commitment of financial resources to regulatory compliance and may increase the Company's cost of operations. Further, the results of the stress testing process may lead the Company to retain additional capital or alter the mix of its capital components.\nTo ensure compliance with these heightened requirements when effective, the Company's regulators may require it to fully comply with these requirements or take actions to prepare for compliance even before the Company's or the Bank's total consolidated assets equal or exceed $10 billion. As a result, the Company may incur compliance-related costs before it might otherwise be required, including if the Company does not continue to grow at the rate it expects or at all. The Company's regulators may also consider its preparation for compliance with these regulatory requirements when examining its operations generally or considering any request for regulatory approval the Company may make, even requests for approvals on unrelated matters.\nThe Company may be subject to more stringent capital requirements.\nAs discussed above, Basel III and the Dodd-Frank Act require the federal banking agencies to establish stricter risk-based capital requirements and leverage limits for banks and bank holding companies. Under the legislation, the federal banking agencies are required to develop capital requirements that address systemically-risky activities. The capital rules must address, at a minimum, risks arising from significant volumes of activity in derivatives, securities products, financial guarantees, securities borrowing and lending and repurchase agreements; concentrations in assets for which reported values are based on models; and concentrations in market share for any activity that would substantially disrupt financial markets if the institutions were forced to unexpectedly cease the activity. These requirements, and any other new regulations, could adversely affect the Company's ability to pay dividends, or could require it to reduce business levels or to raise capital, including in ways that may adversely affect its results of operations or financial condition.\nRegional economic factors may have an adverse impact on the Company's business.\nThe Company's main markets are located in the states of New York and Pennsylvania. Most of the Company's customers are individuals and small and medium-sized businesses which are dependent upon the regional economy. Accordingly, the local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on the demand for the Company's products and services as well as the ability of the Company's customers to repay loans, the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of the Company's deposit funding sources. A prolonged economic downturn in these markets could negatively impact the Company.\nThe Company is subject to a variety of operational risks, including reputational risk, legal and compliance risk, the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, which may adversely affect the Company's business and results of operations.\nThe Company is exposed to many types of operational risks, including reputational risk, legal and compliance risk, the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, unauthorized transactions by employees, or operational errors, including clerical or record keeping errors or those resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems or disclosure of confidential proprietary information of its customers. Negative public opinion can result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, sales practices, customer treatment, corporate governance and acquisitions and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect the Company's ability to attract and keep customers and can expose the Company to litigation and regulatory action. Actual or alleged conduct by the Company can result in negative public opinion about its business.\nIf personal, nonpublic, confidential, or proprietary information of customers in the Company's possession were to be mishandled or misused, the Company could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage, and financial loss. Such mishandling or misuse could include, for example, if such information were erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, either by fault of its systems, employees, or counterparties, or where such information is intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties.\nBecause the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and successfully rectified. The Company's necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process transactions and the large transaction volumes may further increase the risk that technical flaws or employee tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect. The Company also may be subject to disruptions of our operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond its control (for example, computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages), which may give rise to disruption of service to customers and to financial loss or liability. The Company is further exposed to the risk that external vendors may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations (or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors by their respective employees) and to the risk that business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate. The occurrence of any of these risks could result in a diminished ability to operate the Company's business, potential liability to clients, reputational damage, and regulatory intervention, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, perhaps materially.\nThe financial services industry is highly competitive and creates competitive pressures that could adversely affect the Company's revenue and profitability.\nThe financial services industry in which the Company operates is highly competitive. The Company competes not only with commercial and other banks and thrifts, but also with insurance companies, mutual funds, hedge funds, securities brokerage firms and other companies offering financial services in the U.S., globally and over the Internet. The Company competes on the basis of several factors, including capital, access to capital, revenue generation, products, services, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. Over time, certain sectors of the financial services industry have become more concentrated, as institutions involved in a broad range of financial services have been acquired by or merged into other firms. These developments could result in the Company's competitors gaining greater capital and other resources, such as a broader range of products and services and geographic diversity. The Company may experience pricing pressures as a result of these factors and as some of its competitors seek to increase market share by reducing prices or paying higher rates of interest on deposits. Finally, technological change is influencing how individuals and firms conduct their financial affairs and changing the delivery channels for financial services, with the result that the Company may have to contend with a broader range of competitors including many that are not located within the geographic footprint of its banking office network.\nConditions in the insurance market could adversely affect the Company's earnings.\nRevenue from insurance fees and commissions could be negatively affected by fluctuating premiums in the insurance markets or other factors beyond the Company's control. Other factors that affect insurance revenue are the profitability and growth of the Company's clients, the renewal rate of the current insurance policies, continued development of new product and services as well as access to new markets. The Company's insurance revenues and profitability may also be adversely affected by new laws and regulatory developments impacting the healthcare and insurance markets.\nChanges in employee benefit regulations may reduce our profitability.\nThe Company provides products and services to certain employee benefit plans that are subject to ERISA or the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The U.S. Congress has, from time to time, considered legislation relating to changes in ERISA to permit application of state law remedies, such as consequential and punitive damages, in lawsuits for wrongful denial of benefits, which, if adopted, could increase our liability for damages in future litigation. In addition, reductions in contribution levels to defined contribution plans may decrease our profitability.\nIn April 2016, the Department of Labor (\"DOL\") released its final fiduciary definition regulation package, which was scheduled to be phased in April 10, 2017 to January 1, 2018. However, on February 3, 2017 a memorandum was issued that will most likely delay the rules implementation by 180 days. The regulation broadens the definition of a fiduciary under ERISA to include persons providing investment advice to an employee benefit plan or an IRA for a fee or other compensation. The DOL also released two new prohibited transaction class exemptions and amendments to current prohibited transaction exemptions. Broker-dealers and advisors are in various stages of determining the implications of the regulations and changes to the regulations on their business models. Even with this fluid environment, our preliminary assessment of the new regulation's impact to our business and future financial results indicates the costs will not have a significant effect on our financial condition or results of operations. As the rules become applicable and are operationalized, we will assess what business impacts need to be addressed and how they affect the organization.\nThe allowance for loan losses may be insufficient.\nThe Company's business depends on the creditworthiness of its customers. The Company reviews the allowance for loan losses quarterly for adequacy considering economic conditions and trends, collateral values and credit quality indicators, including past charge-off experience and levels of past due loans and nonperforming assets. If the Company's assumptions prove to be incorrect, the Company's allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in the Company's loan portfolio, resulting in additions to the allowance. Material additions to the allowance would materially decrease its net income. It is possible that over time the allowance for loan losses will be inadequate to cover credit losses in the portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy, market conditions or events adversely affecting specific customers, industries or markets.\nChanges in the equity markets could materially affect the level of assets under management and the demand for other fee-based services.\nEconomic downturns could affect the volume of income from and demand for fee-based services. Revenue from the wealth management and benefit plan administration businesses depends in large part on the level of assets under management and administration. Market volatility, and the potential to lead customers to liquidate investments, as well as lower asset values, can reduce the level of assets under management and administration and thereby decrease the Company's investment management and administration revenues.\nMortgage banking income may experience significant volatility.\nMortgage banking income is highly influenced by the level and direction of mortgage interest rates, and real estate and refinancing activity. In lower interest rate environments, the demand for mortgage loans and refinancing activity will tend to increase. This has the effect of increasing fee income, but could adversely impact the estimated fair value of the Company's mortgage servicing rights as the rate of loan prepayments increase. In higher interest rate environments, the demand for mortgage loans and refinancing activity will generally be lower. This has the effect of decreasing fee income opportunities.\nThe Company depends on dividends from its banking subsidiary for cash revenues, but those dividends are subject to restrictions.\nThe ability of the Company to satisfy its obligations and pay cash dividends to its shareholders is primarily dependent on the earnings of and dividends from the subsidiary bank. However, payment of dividends by the bank subsidiary is limited by dividend restrictions and capital requirements imposed by bank regulations. The ability to pay dividends is also subject to the continued payment of interest that the Company owes on its subordinated junior debentures. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had $102 million of subordinated junior debentures outstanding. The Company has the right to defer payment of interest on the subordinated junior debentures for a period not exceeding 20 quarters, although the Company has not done so to date. If the Company defers interest payments on the subordinated junior debentures, it will be prohibited, subject to certain exceptions, from paying cash dividends on the common stock until all deferred interest has been paid and interest payments on the subordinated junior debentures resumes.\nRisks related to the Company's proposed merger with Merchants.\nThe Company and Merchants have operated and, until the completion of the merger, will continue to operate, independently. The success of the merger, including anticipated benefits and cost savings, will depend, in part, on the Company's and Merchants' ability to successfully combine and integrate the businesses of the Company and Merchants in a manner that permits growth opportunities and does not materially disrupt the existing customer relations or result in decreased revenues due to loss of customers. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of either entity's ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the combined entity's ability to maintain relationships with customers, depositors, clients and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger. If the combined company experiences difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected.\nThe Company has incurred, and will continue to incur, substantial expenses in connection with the negotiation and completion of the transaction contemplated by the merger agreement with Merchants. If the merger is not completed, the Company would have to recognize these expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the merger. These circumstances could have an adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and stock price.\nBefore the merger may be completed, the Company must obtain approval from the OCC and the FRB. Other approvals, waivers or consents from regulators may also be required. These regulators may impose conditions on the completion of the merger or require changes to the terms of the merger. Although the Company and Merchants do not currently expect that any such conditions or changes would be imposed, there can be no assurance that they will not be, and such conditions or changes could have the effect of delaying or preventing completion of the merger or imposing additional costs on or limiting the revenues of the combined company following the merger, any of which might have an adverse effect on the combined company following the merger.\nBefore the merger may be completed, Merchants must obtain the requisite approval of its stockholders. There is no assurance that this approval will be obtained.\nThe risks presented by acquisitions could adversely affect the Company's financial condition and result of operations.\nThe business strategy of the Company includes growth through acquisition. Any other future acquisitions will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions. These risks include among other things: obtaining timely regulatory approval, the difficulty of integrating operations and personnel, the potential disruption of our ongoing business, the inability of the Company's management to maximize its financial and strategic position, the inability to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, and the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of changes in ownership and management. Further, the asset quality or other financial characteristics of a company may deteriorate after the acquisition agreement is signed or after the acquisition closes.\nA portion of the Company's loan portfolio is acquired and was not underwritten by the Company at origination.\nAt December 31, 2016, 10% of the loan portfolio was acquired and was not underwritten by the Company at origination, and therefore is not necessarily reflective of the Company's historical credit risk experience. The Company performed extensive credit due diligence prior to each acquisition and marked the loans to fair value upon acquisition, with such fair valuation considering expected credit losses that existed at the time of acquisition. Additionally, the Company evaluates the expected cash flows of these loans on a quarterly basis. However, there is a risk that credit losses could be larger than currently anticipated, thus adversely affecting earnings.\nThe Company may be required to record impairment charges related to goodwill, other intangible assets and the investment portfolio.\nThe Company may be required to record impairment charges in respect to goodwill, other intangible assets and the investment portfolio. Numerous factors, including lack of liquidity for resale of certain investment securities, absence of reliable pricing information for investment securities, the economic condition of state and local municipalities, adverse changes in the business climate, adverse actions by regulators, unanticipated changes in the competitive environment or a decision to change the operations or dispose of an operating unit could have a negative effect on the investment portfolio, goodwill or other intangible assets in future periods.\nThe Company's financial statements are based, in part, on assumptions and estimates, which, if conditions change, could cause unexpected losses in the future.\nPursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, the Company is required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing its financial statements, including in determining credit loss reserves, mortgage repurchase liability and reserves related to litigation, among other items. Certain of the Company's financial instruments, including available-for-sale securities and certain loans, among other items, require a determination of their fair value in order to prepare the Company's financial statements. Where quoted market prices are not available, the Company may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management judgment. Some of these and other assets and liabilities may have no direct observable price levels, making their valuation particularly subjective, as they are based on significant estimation and judgment. In addition, sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain balance sheet items, which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment. If assumptions or estimates underlying the Company's financial statements are incorrect, it may experience material losses.\nFinancial services companies depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions, the Company may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements, credit reports and other financial information. The Company may also rely on representations of those customers, counterparties or other third parties, such as independent auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. Reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements, credit reports or other information could have a material adverse impact on business and, in turn, the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company's information systems may experience an interruption or security breach.\nThe Company relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business. The Company may be the subject of sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to assets or confidential information, destroy data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyber-attacks and other means. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in the Company's online banking system, its general ledger, and its deposit and loan servicing and origination systems or other systems. Furthermore, if personal, confidential or proprietary information of customers or clients in the Company's possession were to be mishandled or misused, the Company could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage and financial loss. Such mishandling or misuse could include circumstances where, for example, such information was erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, either by fault of the Company's systems, employees, or counterparties, or where such information was intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties. The Company has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the possible failure, interruption or security breach of its information systems; however, any such failure, interruption or security breach could adversely affect the Company's business and results of operations through loss of assets or by requiring it to expend significant resources to correct the defect, as well as exposing the Company to customer dissatisfaction and civil litigation, regulatory fines or penalties or losses not covered by insurance.\nThe Company is exposed to fraud in many aspects of the services and products that it provides.\nThe Company offers a wide variety of products and services. When account credentials and other access tools are not adequately protected, risks and potential costs may increase. As (a) sales of these services and products expand, (b) those who are committing fraud become more sophisticated and more determined, and (c) banking services and product offerings expand, the Company's operational losses could increase.\nThe Company may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. The Company has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry. Many of these transactions expose the Company to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by the Company cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to the Company. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is or may become involved in lawsuits, legal proceedings, information-gathering requests, investigations, and proceedings by governmental agencies or other parties that may lead to adverse consequences.\nAs a participant in the financial services industry, many aspects of the Company's business involve substantial risk of legal liability. The Company and its subsidiaries have been named or threatened to be named as defendants in various lawsuits arising from its or its subsidiaries' business activities (and in some cases from the activities of acquired companies). In addition, from time to time, the Company is, or may become, the subject of governmental and self-regulatory agency information-gathering requests, reviews, investigations and proceedings and other forms of regulatory inquiry, including by bank regulatory agencies, the SEC and law enforcement authorities. The results of such proceedings could lead to delays in or prohibition to acquire other companies, significant penalties, including monetary penalties, damages, adverse judgments, settlements, fines, injunctions, restrictions on the way in which the Company conducts its business, or reputational harm.\nAlthough the Company establishes accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company does not have accruals for all legal proceedings where it faces a risk of loss. In addition, due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings, amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to the Company from the legal proceedings in question. Thus, the Company's ultimate losses may be higher than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies, which could adversely affect the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company continually encounters technological change and the failure to understand and adapt to these changes could have a negative impact on the business.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. The Company's future success depends, in part, upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in the Company's operations. Many of the Company's competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. The Company may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological changes affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nTrading activity in the Company's common stock could result in material price fluctuations.\nThe market price of the Company's common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of other factors including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7\nChanges in securities analysts' expectations of financial performance;\n\u00b7\nVolatility of stock market prices and volumes;\n\u00b7\nIncorrect information or speculation;\n\u00b7\nChanges in industry valuations;\n\u00b7\nVariations in operating results from general expectations;\n\u00b7\nActions taken against the Company by various regulatory agencies;\n\u00b7\nChanges in authoritative accounting guidance by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other regulatory agencies;\n\u00b7\nChanges in general domestic economic conditions such as inflation rates, tax rates, unemployment rates, oil prices, labor and healthcare cost trend rates, recessions, and changing government policies, laws and regulations; and\n\u00b7\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external events.\nThe Company's ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to the success of its business, and failure to do so may have a materially adverse effect on the Company's performance.\nThe Company's employees are its most important resource, and in many areas of the financial services industry, competition for qualified personnel is intense. The imposition on the Company or its employees of certain existing and proposed restrictions or taxes on executive compensation may adversely affect the Company's ability to attract and retain qualified senior management and employees. If the Company provides inadequate succession planning, is unable to continue to retain and attract qualified employees, the Company's performance, including its competitive position, could have a materially adverse effect.", "PERMNO": 86896, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "CBU"}
