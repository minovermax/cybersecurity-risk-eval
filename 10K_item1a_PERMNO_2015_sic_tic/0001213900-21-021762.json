{"cik": "1066923", "company": "Future FinTech Group Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-04-15", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nOur business and an investment in our securities are subject to a variety of risks. The following risk factors describe the most significant events, facts or circumstances that could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition, results of operations, ability to implement our business plan and the market price for our securities. Additional risks and uncertainties that presently are not considered material or are not known to us, and therefore are not mentioned herein, may impair our business operations. Many of these events are outside of our control. If any of these risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and investors in our common stock could lose all or part of their investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nAn occurrence of an uncontrollable event such as the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively affect our operations and financial results.\nIn recent years, there have been outbreaks of epidemics in various countries, including China. Recently, there was an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) in China, which has spread rapidly to many parts of the world, including the U.S. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in, among other things, quarantines, travel restrictions, and the temporary closure of office buildings and facilities in China and in the U.S.\nSubstantially all of our revenues are generated in China. Consequently, our results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected, to the extent that COVID-19 harms the Chinese and global economy. Any potential impact to our results will depend on, to a large extent, future developments and new information that may emerge regarding the duration and severity of COVID-19 and the actions taken by government authorities and other entities to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, almost all of which are beyond our control. Potential impacts include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf temporary closure of offices, travel restrictions or suspension of transportation of products to our customers; and our suppliers have been negatively affected, and could continue to be negatively affected, on their ability to fulfill our demands if there is any resurgence of COVID-19;\n\u25cf our customers that are negatively impacted by the outbreak of COVID-19 may reduce their budgets to purchase our products and services, which may materially adversely impact our revenue;\n\u25cf We may have to provide significant sales incentives to our customers in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, which may in turn materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results;\n\u25cf The business operations of our customers, third party stores on our platform and suppliers have been and could continue to be negatively impacted by the outbreak, which may result in loss of customers or disruption of our services, which may in turn materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results;\n\u25cf any disruption of our supply chain, logistics providers or customers could adversely impact our business and results of operations, including causing our suppliers to cease manufacturing products for a period of time or materially delay delivery to customers, which may also lead to loss of customers, as well as reputational, competitive and business harm to us;\n\u25cf The Company\u2019s promotion strategy for our e-commerce platform mainly relied on the training of members and distributors through meetings and conferences. Due to the outbreak of COVID-19, the Chinese government put a restriction on large gatherings and these restrictions has made and may continue to make the promotion strategy for CCM Shopping Mall and NONOGIRL difficult to implement, which have caused and may continue to cause the decrease in the sales of goods and new members\u2019 enrollment.\n\u25cf many of our customers, distributors, suppliers and other partners are individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which may not have strong cash flows or be well capitalized, and may be vulnerable to an epidemic outbreak and slowing macroeconomic conditions. If the SMEs that we work with cannot weather COVID-19 and the resulting economic impact, or cannot resume business as usual after a prolonged outbreak, our revenues and business operations may be materially and adversely impacted;\n\u25cf The global stock markets may experience, significant decline from the COVID-19 outbreak, which could materially adversely affect our stock price.\nBecause of the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak, the future impact related to the outbreak and potential resurgence as well as the local and global response cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.\nThe global economy has also been materially negatively affected by the COVID-19 and there is continued severe uncertainty about the duration and intensity of its impacts. The Chinese and global growth forecast is extremely uncertain, which would seriously affect the consumer spending in shopping malls.\nWhile the potential economic impact brought by, and the duration of, COVID-19 may be difficult to assess or predict, a widespread pandemic could result in significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital, which could negatively affect our liquidity. In addition, a recession or market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially affect our business and the value of our common stock.\nFurther, as we do not have access to a revolving credit facility, there can be no assurance that we would be able to secure commercial debt financing in the future in the event that we require additional capital. We currently believe that our financial resources will be adequate to see us through the outbreak. However, in the event that we do need to raise capital in the future, outbreak-related instability in the securities markets could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital.\nIn general, our business could be adversely affected by the epidemics, including, but not limited to, COVID-19, avian influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the influenza A virus, the Ebola virus, or other outbreaks. In response to an epidemic or other outbreaks, governments and other organizations may adopt regulations and policies that could lead to severe disruption to our daily operations, including temporary closure of our offices and other facilities. These severe conditions may cause us and/or our partners to make internal adjustments, including but not limited to, temporarily closing down business, limiting business hours, and setting restrictions on travel and/or visits with clients and partners for a prolonged period of time. Various impacts arising from severe conditions may cause business disruption, resulting in material, adverse effects to our financial condition and results of operations.\nEconomic conditions have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on consumer spending on our products.\nThe worldwide economy remains volatile and may have entered in global recession. The adverse effect of a sustained international economic downturn, including sustained periods of decreased consumer spending, high unemployment levels, declining consumer or business confidence and continued volatility and disruption in the credit and capital markets, would likely result in reduced demand for our products and service as consumers may forego certain purchases. To the extent an international economic downturn develops, we could experience a reduction in sales volume. If we are unable to reduce our operating costs and expenses proportionately, many of which are fixed, our results of operations would be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to effectively control and manage our growth, and a failure to do so could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nIf our newly developed blockchain based e-commerce business and markets experience significant growth, we will need to expand our business to maintain our competitive position. We may face challenges in managing and financing expansion of our business, facilities and product offerings, including challenges relating to integration of acquired businesses and increased demands on our management team, employees and facilities. Failure to effectively deal with increased demands on us could interrupt or adversely affect our operations and cause production, service and transportation backlogs, longer new products or services development time frames and administrative inefficiencies. Other challenges involved with expansion, acquisitions and operation include:\n\u25cf unanticipated costs;\n\u25cf the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u25cf potential adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;\n\u25cf obtaining sufficient working capital to support expansion;\n\u25cf expanding our product offerings and maintaining the high quality of our products and services;\n\u25cf continuing to fill customers\u2019 orders on time; maintaining adequate control of our expenses and accounting systems;\n\u25cf successfully integrating any future acquisitions; and\n\u25cf anticipating and adapting to changing conditions in the blockchain and/or ecommerce online shopping industries and financial technology, whether from changes in government regulations, mergers and acquisitions, technological developments or other economic, competitive or market dynamics.\nEven if we obtain benefits of expansion in the form of increased sales, there may be delay between the time when the expenses associated with an expansion or acquisition are incurred and the time when we recognize such benefits, which could negatively affect our earnings.\nWe may engage in future acquisitions involving significant expenditures of cash, the incurrence of debt or the issuance of stock, all of which could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results.\nAs part of our business strategy, we review acquisition and strategic investment prospects that we believe would complement our current product offerings, augment our market coverage, enhance our technological capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. From time to time, we review investments in new businesses and we expect to make investments in, and to acquire, businesses, products or technologies in the future. We are in the process to acquire an asset management company in Hong Kong and a supply chain financial service company in China and plan to complete these transactions during the first half of this year. In the event of any future acquisitions, we may expend significant cash, incur substantial debt and/or issue equity securities and dilute the percentage ownership of current shareholders, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and the price of our stock. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully integrate any businesses, products, technologies or personnel that we may acquire in the future, and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf we fail to maintain membership loyalty or sustain membership growth, or fail to maintain member relationships effectively and retain existing members, our business and operating results may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are a membership-based value sharing e-commerce platform and therefore membership loyalty and growth are essential to our business. The growth of our business depends on our ability to maintain and increase the number of members on our platform and improve the level of their engagement. Individuals can become our members mainly by purchasing our membership at a fixed price. Our failure to anticipate needs of and provide value-added services to our members, among other things, could also diminish membership loyalty and reduce activity of members on our platform, which could cause our revenue and operating income to decline and negatively impact our profitability. If our existing and new business opportunities and incentives, products, services and other initiatives do not generate sufficient enthusiasm and economic incentive to retain our existing members or attract new members on a sustained basis, our operating results could be adversely affected. As a result, in order to maintain our business growth in the future, we need to increase our retention of existing members and continue to successfully attract additional members.\nWe may not be able to prevent others from unauthorized use of our intellectual property, which could harm our business and competitive position.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technologies. The process of seeking intellectual property protection can be lengthy and expensive and we cannot guarantee that our existing or future intellectual property rights will be fully protected or bring us the commercial advantages. We also cannot guarantee that our current or potential competitors do not have, and will not obtain, intellectual property rights that will prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to use our technology or sell our products and services in the PRC or other countries.\nThe implementation and enforcement of PRC intellectual property laws historically have not been vigorous or consistent. Accordingly, intellectual property rights and confidentiality protections in the PRC are not as effective as those in the United States and other countries. We may need to resort to litigation to enforce or defend our rights or to determine the enforceability, scope and validity of our proprietary rights or those of others. Such litigation will require significant expenditures of cash and management efforts and could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. An adverse determination in any such litigation will impair our intellectual property rights and may harm our business, competitive position, business prospects and reputation.\nThe blockchain related products and services that we are developing have the potential to be used in ways we do not intend, including for criminal or other illegal activities.\nBlockchain-related products and services, in particular cryptocurrencies, have the potential to be used for financial crimes or other illegal activities. Because the blockchain platform that we are developing is novel, there are uncertainties regarding any legal and regulatory requirements for preventing blockchain-related products and services from being put to such uses, and there are uncertainties regarding the liabilities and risks to the Company if we are unable to prevent such uses. Even if we comply with all laws and regulations regarding financial and blockchain related products and services, we have no ability to ensure that our customers, partners or others to whom we license or sell our products and services comply with all laws and regulations applicable to them and their transactions.\nThe Shared Shopping Mall employs security measures common to blockchain technologies, such a multiple identity authentication and multi-signature requirements. The security measures to be employed by our blockchain projects are subject to further improvement and development. There is no guarantee that the security measures that we currently use or any that we may develop in the future will be effective.\nAny negative publicity we receive regarding any allegations of unlawful uses of our blockchain platform could damage our reputation. More generally, any negative publicity regarding unlawful uses of blockchain technology in the marketplace could reduce the demand for our products and services. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and business.\nThe regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, digital assets, and offerings of digital assets is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development and the value of such cryptocurrencies and assets.\nRegulation of digital assets, cryptocurrencies, blockchain technologies, and the blockchain platform we are developing is currently undeveloped and likely to rapidly evolve as government agencies take greater interest in them. Regulation also varies significantly among international, federal, state and local jurisdictions and is subject to significant uncertainty. Various legislative and executive bodies in the United States and in other countries may in the future adopt laws, regulations, or guidance, or take other actions, which may severely impact the permissibility of tokens generally and the technology behind them or the means of transaction or in transferring them. Failure by our subsidiaries to comply with any laws, rules and regulations, some of which may not exist yet or are subject to interpretation and may be subject to change, could result in a variety of adverse consequences, including civil penalties and fines.\nIntellectual property infringement claims may adversely impact our results of operations.\nAs we develop and introduce new products and services, we may be increasingly subject to claims of infringement of another party\u2019s intellectual property. If a claim for infringement is brought against us, such claim may require us to modify our products or services, cease selling certain products or engage in litigation to determine the validity and scope of such claims. Any of these events may harm our business and results of operations.\nOur business and operations may be subject to disruption from work stoppages, terrorism or natural disasters.\nOur operations may be subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, including work stoppages, acts of war, terrorism, pandemics, fire, earthquake, flooding or other natural disasters and events beyond our control. If a major incident were to occur in any of the regions where our facilities or offices are located, our facilities or offices or those of critical suppliers and customers could be damaged or destroyed. Such a disruption could result in a reduction in available products, the temporary or permanent loss of critical data, suspension of operations, delays in shipment of products and disruption of business generally, which would adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nOur success depends substantially on the continued retention of certain key personnel and our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel in the future to support our growth.\nIf one or more of our senior executives or other key personnel are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, our business may be disrupted and our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. While we depend on the abilities and participation of our current management team generally, we rely particularly upon Mr. Yongke Xue, our Chairman of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d); Mr. Shanchun Huang, our chief executive officer (\u201cCEO\u201d); Mr. Ming Yi, our chief financial officer (\u201cCFO\u201d) and Mr. Yang Liu, our chief operating officer. The loss of the services of Messrs. Yongke Xue, Shanchun Huang, Ming Yi or Yang Liu for any reason could significantly adversely impact our business and results of operations. Competition for senior management and senior technology personnel in the PRC is intense and the pool of qualified candidates is very limited. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that the services of our senior executives and other key personnel will continue to be available to us, or that we will be able to find a suitable replacement for them if they were to leave.\nOur e-commerce business depends on the continued use of the Internet and the adequacy of the Internet infrastructure.\nOur e-commerce business depends upon the widespread use of the Internet and e-commerce. Factors which could reduce the widespread use of the Internet for e-commerce include, without limitation, actual or perceived lack of security of information or privacy protection, cyberattacks or other disruptions or damage to the Internet or to users\u2019 computers, whatever the cause, could reduce customer satisfaction with our platforms and services and harm our business.\nOur business depends on our website, app, network infrastructure and transaction-processing systems.\nOur e-commerce business is completely dependent on our infrastructure. Any system interruption that results in the unavailability of our website, app or reduced performance of our transaction systems could reduce our ability to conduct our business. We use internally and externally developed systems for our website, app and our transaction processing systems. We expect to experience system interruptions due to software failure. We may also experience temporary capacity constraints due to sharply increased traffic during sales or other promotions and during the holiday shopping season. Capacity constraints can cause system disruptions, slower response times, delayed page presentation, degradation in levels of customer service and other problems. We may also experience difficulties with our infrastructure upgrades. Any future difficulties with our transaction processing systems or difficulties upgrading, expanding or integrating aspects of our systems may cause system disruptions, slower response times, and degradation in levels of customer service, additional expense, impaired quality and speed of order fulfilment or other problems.\nIf the location where all of our computer and communications hardware is located is compromised, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. If we suffer an interruption or degradation of services at the location for any reason, our business could be harmed. Our success, and in particular, our ability to successfully receive and fulfil orders and provide high-quality customer service, largely depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications systems. These limitations could have an adverse effect on our sales. Our disaster recovery plan may be inadequate, and we do not carry business interruption insurance to compensate us for the losses that could occur. Despite our implementation of network security measures, our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions, the occurrence of any of which could lead to interruptions, delays, loss of critical data or the inability to accept and fulfil customer orders. The occurrence of any of the foregoing risks could harm our business.\nWe may be subject to product liability claims if our customers are harmed by the products sold on our internet platform.\nWe sell products manufactured by third parties, some of which may be defectively designed or manufactured, of inferior quality or counterfeit. Sales and distributions of products on our internet platform could expose us to product liability claims relating to personal injury and may require product recalls or other actions. Third parties that have suffered such injury may bring claims or legal proceedings against us as the retailer of the products or as the marketplace service provider. Although we would have legal recourse against the manufacturers, suppliers or third-party merchants of such products under PRC law, attempting to enforce our rights against the manufacturers, suppliers or third-party merchants may be expensive, time-consuming and ultimately futile. Defective, inferior or counterfeit products or negative publicity as to personal injury caused by products sold on our platform may adversely affect consumer perceptions of our company or the products we sell, which could harm our reputation and brand image. In addition, we do not currently maintain any product liability insurance or third-party liability insurance coverage for the products offered through third-party merchants. As a result, any material product liability claim or litigation could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even unsuccessful claims could result in the expenditure of funds and managerial efforts in defending them and could have a negative impact on our reputation.\nOur platform requires frequent updates on pricing from our vendors. If these updates are inaccurate or do not occur, there could be a negative influence on our business.\nWe update the prices of products listed on our site frequently from our vendors. If we are unable to obtain, or are not provided updated pricing information from our vendors, or if we fail to act on information from our vendors, then it could require us to remedy the pricing difference to complete the transaction, or source the product from an alternative vendor at their price, which could materially adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are subject to cyber security risks and may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks and to respond to cyber incidents.\nOur e-commerce business is entirely dependent on the secure operation of our website and systems as well as the operation of the Internet generally. Our business involves the storage and transmission of users\u2019 proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation, and potential liability. A number of large Internet companies have suffered security breaches, some of which have involved intentional attacks. From time to time, we and many other Internet businesses also may be subject to a denial of service attacks wherein attackers attempt to block customers\u2019 access to our Website. If we are unable to avert a denial of service attack for any significant period, we could sustain substantial revenue loss from lost sales and customer dissatisfaction. We may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyberattacks.\nCyberattacks may target us, our customers, our suppliers, banks, payment processors, e-commerce in general or the communication infrastructure on which we depend. If an actual or perceived attack or breach of our security occurs, customer and/or supplier perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose customers, suppliers or both. Actual or anticipated attacks and risks may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third party experts and consultants. A person who is able to circumvent our security measures might be able to misappropriate our or our users\u2019 proprietary information, cause interruption in our operations, damage our computers or those of our users, or otherwise damage our reputation and business. Any compromise of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could harm our business.\nFailure to comply with the relatively new E-Commerce Law may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nAs the e-commerce industry is still evolving in China, new laws and regulations may be adopted from time to time to address new issues that arise from time to time. For example, in August 2018, the Standing Committee of the National People\u2019s Congress promulgated the E-Commerce Law, which became effective on January 1, 2019. The E-Commerce Law generally provides that e-commerce operators must obtain administrative licenses if business activities conducted by the e-commerce operators are subject to administrative licensing requirements under applicable laws and regulations. In addition, the E-Commerce Law imposes a number of obligations on e-commerce platform operators, including the obligations: (i) to verify and register platform merchants, (ii) to ensure platform cybersecurity, including, but not limited to, data privacy, (iii) to ensure fair dealing and the legitimate rights and interests of consumers on the platform, (iv) to publicize transaction information preservation and transaction rules, and (v) to protect intellectual properties. See \u201cItem 1. Overview-Government Regulations-Regulations Relating to E-Commerce\u201d for further details. As the E-Commerce Law is relatively new, no detailed interpretation and implementation rules have been promulgated, and it remains uncertain how the E-Commerce Law will be interpreted and implemented. We cannot assure you that our current business operations satisfy the obligations provided under the E-Commerce Law in all respects. If the PRC governmental authorities determine that we are not in compliance with all the requirements proposed under the E-Commerce Law, we may be subject to fines and/or other sanctions.\nThe E-Commerce Law also imposes a requirement on operators of e-commerce platforms, such as our company, to assist in tax collection with respect to income generated by sellers from transactions conducted on e-commerce platforms, including, among others, submitting to the tax authority information on the identities of sellers on e-commerce platforms and other information relating to tax payment. Failure to comply with the requirement may result in operators of e-commerce platforms being subject to fines and, in severe circumstances, suspension of business operations of e-commerce platforms. Substantial uncertainties exist regarding the interpretation and implementation of the E-Commerce Law. We encourage and incentivize merchants to promote the products on our platform. If the merchants were deemed to be selling our products on consignment basis, the PRC tax authorities may require them to make tax registration and request our assistance in these efforts, pursuant to the E-Commerce Law, and the merchants on our platform may be subject to more stringent tax compliance requirements. The PRC government may adopt additional requirements from time to time, and we may be requested by tax authorities to provide further assistance in the enforcement of tax regulations, such as disclosure of transaction records and bank account information of the merchants, and withholding taxes for such merchants. If any of these were to occur, we may lose our existing stores or fail to attract new stores on our platform and the level of activity may be reduced on our platform. We may also incur increased costs and expenses as a result. The tightened tax enforcement by PRC tax authorities in the e-commerce industry, such as imposition of reporting or withholding obligations on operators of e-commerce platforms with respect to tax payable of merchants on e-commerce platforms, may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our business model were found to be in violation of applicable laws and regulations, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nIn August 2005, the State Council promulgated the Regulations on the Prohibition of Pyramid Selling, which prohibits individuals and entities in China from engaging in pyramid selling. See \u201cItem 1. Overview-Government Regulations-Regulations Relating to Pyramid Selling in the PRC.\u201d We believe that our current business model that provides rewards to members who introduce new members and customers to us is not in violation of applicable PRC laws and regulations, including the Regulations on the Prohibition of Pyramid Selling. However, there is no assurance that the relevant government authorities will find our business model not in violation of any applicable regulations, given the uncertainties in the interpretation and application of existing PRC laws, regulations and policies relating to our current business model, including, but not limited to, regulations regulating pyramid selling. Moreover, new laws, regulations or policies may also be promulgated in the future, and there is no assurance that our current business model will be in full compliance with the new laws, regulations or policies. If our business model were to be found in violation in the future, we will have to make adjustment to our business model or cease certain of our business operations, and the relevant governmental authorities may confiscate any illegal gains and impose a fine, which would have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe relative lack of public company experience of our management team may put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nOur management team lacks significant public company experience, which could impair our ability to comply with legal and regulatory requirements such as, but not limited to, those imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSarbanes-Oxley\u201d). Our senior management does not have significant experience managing a publicly traded company. Such responsibilities include complying with federal securities laws and making required disclosures on a timely basis. Our senior management may be unable to implement programs and policies in an effective and timely manner or that adequately respond to the increased legal, regulatory and reporting requirements associated with being a publicly traded company. Our failure to comply with all applicable requirements could lead to the imposition of fines and penalties, distract our management from attending to the management and growth of our business, result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nAs a public company, we are obligated to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting. Our internal controls may be determined not to be effective, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, decrease the value of our Common Stock.\nThe PRC has not adopted management and financial reporting concepts and practices similar to those in the United States. We may have difficulty in hiring and retaining a sufficient number of qualified financial and accounting employees who are familiar with US GAAP and reporting requirements to work in the PRC. As a result of these factors, we may experience difficulty in establishing and maintaining accounting and financial controls, collecting financial data, budgeting, managing our funds and preparing financial statements, books of account and corporate records and instituting business practices that meet investors\u2019 expectations in the United States.\nRules adopted by the SEC, or the Commission, pursuant to Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 require annual assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting. The standards that must be met for management to assess the internal controls over financial reporting as effective are relatively new and complex, and they require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards. This assessment will need to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. During the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as we have done previously and this year, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective. If we continue to be unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could harm our business and cause the price of our stock to decline.\nWe may need additional capital to fund our future operations and, if it is not available when needed, we may need to reduce our planned development and marketing efforts, which may reduce our sales revenue.\nWe believe that our existing working capital and cash available from operations will enable us to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months. However, if cash from future operations is insufficient, or if cash is used for acquisitions or other currently unanticipated uses, we may need additional capital. The development and marketing of new products and services and the expansion of our business and associated support personnel require a significant commitment of resources. In addition, if the markets for our products and services develop more slowly than anticipated, or if we fail to establish significant market share and achieve sufficient net revenues, we may continue to consume significant amounts of capital. As a result, we could be required to raise additional capital. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities or other methods, the issuance of such securities could result in dilution of the shares held by existing shareholders. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities, such securities may provide the holders certain rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of common shareholders, and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on our operations. We cannot guarantee that additional capital, if required, will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain sufficient amounts of additional capital, we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned business development and marketing efforts, which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf our costs and demands upon management increase disproportionately to the growth of our business and revenue as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies, our operating results could be harmed.\nAs a public company, we do and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting, investor relations and other expenses, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. We also have incurred and will incur costs associated with current corporate governance requirements, including requirements under Section 404 and other provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley, as well as rules implemented by the SEC and the stock exchange on which our common stock is traded. The expenses incurred by public companies for reporting and corporate governance purposes have increased dramatically over the past several years. These rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs substantially and make some activities more time consuming and costly. If our costs and demands upon management increase disproportionately to the growth of our business and revenue, our operating results could be harmed.\nThere are inherent uncertainties involved in estimates, judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. Any changes in estimates, judgments and assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d) involves making estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets (including intangible assets), liabilities and related reserves, revenue, expenses and income. Estimates, judgments and assumptions are inherently subject to change in the future, and any such changes could result in corresponding changes to the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and income. Any such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe will no longer have any equity participation in HeDeTang HK or in the fruit juice industry.\nAfter the Sale Transaction closed on February 27, 2020, we have no ongoing equity participation in the fruit juice business in China. We ceased to participate in HeDeTang HK\u2019s future earnings or growth, if any, and will not participate in any potential future sale of HeDeTang HK even if there is significant growth of fruit juice business in China in the future. It is possible that New Continent could sell some or all of its equity in HeDeTang HK following the Sale Transaction at a valuation higher than that being paid in the Sale Transaction and New Continent could realize significant returns on its equity investment in HeDeTang.\nWe may be exposed to litigation related to the Sale Transaction on February 27, 2020 from the holders of our common stock.\nTransactions such as the Sale Transaction are often subject to lawsuits by stockholders. Particularly because the holders of our common stock will not receive any consideration from the Sale Transaction, it is possible that they may sue the Company or the Board of Directors. Such lawsuits could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to enterprise income tax, value-added tax, and other taxes in each province and city in China where we have operations. Our tax structure is subject to review by various local tax authorities. The determination of our provision for income tax and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate decisions by the relevant tax authorities may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.\nWe are subject to the risk of increased income taxes, which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe base our tax position upon the anticipated nature and conduct of our business and upon our understanding of the tax laws of the various countries in which we have assets or conduct activities. However, our tax position is subject to review and possible challenge by tax authorities and to possible changes in law, which may have retroactive effect. We currently operate through three direct wholly-owned subsidiaries: DigiPay FinTech Limited, Future FinTech (Hong Kong) Limited, and GlobalKey Shared Mall Limited, and their subsidiaries and VIE in Hong Kong, BVI, Japan, Cayman Islands and China, and we maintain our e-commerce operations in China. Any of these jurisdictions could assert tax claims against us. We cannot determine in advance the extent to which some jurisdictions may require us to pay taxes or make payments in lieu of taxes. If we become subject to additional taxes in any jurisdiction, such tax treatment could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIncreases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or disagreements with tax authorities could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. Increases in income tax rates or other changes in income tax laws that apply to our business could reduce our after-tax income from such jurisdiction and could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our operations outside the United States generate a significant portion of our income. In addition, the United States and many of the other countries in which our products are distributed or sold, including countries in which we have significant operations, have recently made or are actively considering changes to existing tax laws. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTCJ Act\u201d) was signed into law in the United States. The changes in the TCJ Act are broad and complex and we are continuing to examine the impact the TCJ Act may have on our business and financial results. Additional changes in the U.S. tax regime or in how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings, including changes in how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are also subject to regular reviews, examinations and audits by the IRS and other taxing authorities with respect to income and non-income based taxes both within and outside the United States. Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenues in jurisdictions in which we operate, or the adoption of new or reformed tax legislation or regulation, may make resolving tax disputes more difficult and the final resolution of tax audits and any related litigation could differ from our historical provisions and accruals, resulting in an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, in connection with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project, companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in various countries.\nRisks Related to Doing Business in the PRC\nWe face the risk that changes in the policies of the PRC government could have a significant impact upon the business we may be able to conduct in the PRC and the profitability of such business.\nWe conduct substantially all of our operations and generate most of our revenue in the PRC. Accordingly, economic, political and legal developments in the PRC will significantly affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. The PRC economy is in transition from a planned economy to a market oriented economy subject to plans adopted by the government that set national economic development goals. Policies of the PRC government can have significant effects on economic conditions in the PRC. While we believe that the PRC will continue to strengthen its economic and trading relationships with foreign countries and that business development in the PRC will continue to follow market forces, we cannot guarantee that this will be the case. Our interests may be adversely affected by changes in policies by the PRC government, including:\n\u25cf changes in laws, regulations or their interpretation;\n\u25cf confiscatory taxation;\n\u25cf restrictions on currency conversion, imports or sources of supplies;\n\u25cf expropriation or nationalization of private enterprises; and\n\u25cf the allocation of resources.\nAlthough the PRC government has been pursuing economic reform policies for more than three decades, the PRC government continues to exercise significant control over economic growth in the PRC through the allocation of resources, controlling payments of foreign currency, setting monetary policy and imposing policies that impact particular industries in different ways. We cannot guarantee that the PRC government will continue to pursue policies favoring a market oriented economy or that existing policies will not be significantly altered, especially in the event of a change in leadership, social or political disruption, or other circumstances affecting political, economic and social life in the PRC.\nIf we become subject to additional scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity involving U.S.-listed China-based companies, we may have to expend significant resources to investigate and resolve the matter which could harm our business operations, this offering and our reputation and could result in a loss of your investment in our shares, especially if such matter cannot be addressed and resolved favorably.\nRecently, U.S. public companies that have substantially all of their operations in China have been the subject of intense scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity by investors, financial commentators and regulatory agencies. Much of the scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity has centered around financial and accounting irregularities, a lack of effective internal controls over financial accounting, inadequate corporate governance policies or a lack of adherence thereto and, in some cases, allegations of fraud. As a result of the scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity, the publicly traded stock of many U.S.-listed China-based companies has decreased in value and, in some cases, has become virtually worthless. Many of these companies have been subject to shareholder lawsuits and SEC enforcement actions and have conducted internal and external investigations into the allegations. On February 21, 2020, the Company received a subpoena from the SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement requiring us to produce documents and detailed information relating to, among other things, the Company\u2019s accounting procedures, management oversight, and the sale of HeDeTang Holdings (HK) Ltd. to New Continent International Co., Ltd. The Company has provided responsive documents and information requested in the subpoena. It is not clear what effect this sector-wide scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity will have on us and our business. If we become the subject of any unfavorable allegations, whether such allegations are proven to be true or untrue, we will have to expend significant resources to investigate such allegations and/or defend our company. This situation may be a major distraction to our management. If such allegations are not proven to be groundless, our business operations will be severely hindered and your investment in our shares could be rendered worthless.\nIf the PRC government deems that the contractual arrangements in relation to our consolidated variable interest entities do not comply with PRC regulatory restrictions on foreign investment in the relevant industries, or if these regulations or the interpretation of existing regulations change in the future, we could be subject to severe penalties or be forced to relinquish our interests in those operations.\nForeign ownership of internet-based businesses, including value-added telecommunications services, is subject to restrictions under current PRC laws and regulations. To comply with PRC laws and regulations, we conduct our e-commerce operations in China through a series of contractual arrangements entered into among WFOE, our VIE and the shareholders of our VIE. As a result of these contractual arrangements, we exert control over our VIE and consolidate its operating results in our financial statements under U.S. GAAP. For a detailed description of these contractual arrangements, see \u201cOverview - Contractual Arrangements with Our Consolidated Affiliated Entity and Its Respective Shareholders.\u201d\nIn the opinion of our PRC counsel, our current ownership structure, the ownership structure of our PRC subsidiary and our consolidated VIE, and the contractual arrangements among WFOE, our VIE and the shareholders of our VIE are common practices for the companies listed on stock exchanges in the U.S. engaging in the businesses restricted in China and these contractual arrangements are valid and binding in accordance with their terms and applicable PRC laws and regulations currently in effect. However, our Chinese counsel has also advised us that there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current or future PRC laws and regulations and there can be no assurance that the PRC government will ultimately take a view that is consistent with the opinion of our PRC counsel.\nIf the PRC government finds that our contractual arrangements do not comply with its restrictions on foreign investment in the e-commerce business, the relevant PRC regulatory authorities, including the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) may require us to discontinue or place restrictions or onerous conditions on our operations and it may also imposing fines, confiscating the income from the WFOE or our VIE. The imposition of any of these penalties would result in a material and adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business. In addition, it is unclear what impact the PRC government actions would have on us and on our ability to consolidate the financial results of our VIE in our consolidated financial statements, if the PRC government authorities were to find our VIE structure and contractual arrangements to be in violation of PRC laws and regulations. If the imposition of any of these government actions causes us to lose our right to direct the activities of our VIE or our right to receive substantially all of the economic benefits and residual returns from our VIE and we are not able to restructure our ownership structure and operations in a satisfactory manner, we would no longer be able to consolidate the financial results of our VIE in our consolidated financial statements. Either of these results, or any other significant penalties that might be imposed on us in this event, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAny failure by our consolidated VIE or their shareholders to perform their obligations under our contractual arrangements with them would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf our consolidated VIE or its shareholders fail to perform their respective obligations under the contractual arrangements, we may have to incur substantial costs and expend additional resources to enforce such arrangements. We may also have to rely on legal remedies under PRC laws, including seeking specific performance or injunctive relief, and claiming damages, which we cannot assure you will be effective under PRC laws. For example, if the shareholders of our VIE were to refuse to transfer their equity interest in the VIE to us or our designee if we exercise the purchase option pursuant to these contractual arrangements, or if they were otherwise to act in bad faith toward us, then we may have to take legal action to compel them to perform their contractual obligations.\nAll the agreements under our contractual arrangements are governed by PRC laws. Accordingly, these contracts would be interpreted in accordance with PRC laws and any disputes would be resolved in accordance with PRC legal procedures. The legal system in the PRC is not as well established as in some other jurisdictions, such as in the United States. As a result, uncertainties in the PRC legal system could limit our ability to enforce these contractual arrangements. Meanwhile, there are some regulations unfavorable to VIEs. However, despite there are very few precedents and little formal guidance as to how contractual arrangements in the context of a consolidated variable interest entity should be interpreted or enforced under PRC laws and there remain significant uncertainties regarding the ultimate outcome of such legal proceedings should legal action become necessary. Currently, almost all of the Chinese companies listed on overseas stock exchanges that are in the internet-based business such as e-commerce or online-gaming have adopted a VIE structure. If the losing parties fail to carry out the court judgement or arbitration awards within a prescribed time limit, the prevailing parties may only enforce them in PRC courts, which would require additional expenses and delay. In the event that we are unable to enforce these contractual arrangements, or if we suffer significant delay or other obstacles in the process of enforcing these contractual arrangements, we may not be able to exert effective control over our consolidated variable interest entities, and our ability to conduct our business may be negatively affected.\nThe shareholders of our consolidated VIE may have potential conflicts of interest with us, which may materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nThe shareholders of our VIE and their interests in our VIE may differ from their interests of our Company as a whole. These shareholders may breach, or cause our consolidated variable interest entities to breach, the existing contractual arrangements we have with them and our consolidated variable interest entities, which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to effectively control our consolidated variable interest entities and receive economic benefits from them. For example, the shareholders may be able to cause our agreements with E-Commerce Tianjin to be performed in a manner adverse to us by, among other things, failing to remit payments due under the contractual arrangements to us on a timely basis. We cannot assure you that when conflicts of interest arise, any or all of these shareholders will act in the best interests of our company or such conflicts will be resolved in our favor.\nCurrently, we do not have any arrangements to address potential conflicts of interest between these shareholders and our company, except that we could exercise our purchase option under the exclusive option agreements with these shareholders to request them to transfer all of their equity interests in E-Commerce Tianjin to a PRC entity or individual designated by us, to the extent permitted by PRC laws. If we cannot resolve any conflict of interest or dispute between us and the shareholders of our VIE, we would have to rely on legal proceedings, which could result in the disruption of our business and subject us to substantial uncertainty as to the outcome of any such legal proceedings.\nPRC laws and regulations governing our current business operations are sometimes vague and uncertain and any changes in such laws and regulations may harm our business.\nThere are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of PRC laws and regulations including, but not limited to, the laws and regulations governing our business and the enforcement and performance of our arrangements with customers in certain circumstances. We are considered foreign persons or foreign funded enterprises under PRC laws and, as a result, we are required to comply with PRC laws and regulations related to foreign persons and foreign funded enterprises. These laws and regulations are sometimes vague and may be subject to future changes, and their official interpretation and enforcement may involve substantial uncertainty. The effectiveness of newly enacted laws, regulations or amendments may be delayed, resulting in detrimental reliance. New laws and regulations that affect existing and proposed future businesses may also be applied retroactively. We cannot predict what effect the interpretation of existing or new PRC laws or regulations may have on our business.\nWe could be restricted from paying dividends to shareholders due to PRC laws and other contractual requirements.\nWe are a holding company incorporated in the State of Florida and do not have any assets or conduct any business operations other than our investments in our subsidiaries and affiliates. As a result of our holding company structure, we rely entirely on dividend payments from our subsidiaries in China. PRC accounting standards and regulations currently permit payment of dividends only out of accumulated profits, a portion of which is required to be set aside for certain reserve funds. Furthermore, if our subsidiaries and VIE in China incur debt on its own in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict its ability to pay dividends or make other payments. Although we do not intend to pay dividends in the future, our inability to receive all of the profit from our China subsidiaries\u2019 operations may provide an additional obstacle to our ability to pay dividends if we so decide in the future.\nGovernmental control of currency conversion may affect the value of shareholder investments.\nThe PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility of RMB into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of the PRC. RMB is currently not a freely convertible currency. Shortages in the availability of foreign currency may restrict our ability to remit sufficient foreign currency to satisfy foreign currency obligations. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and expenditures from the transaction, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval by complying with certain procedural requirements. Approval from appropriate governmental authorities, however, is required where RMB is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of the PRC to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of bank loans denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, the PRC government could restrict access to foreign currencies for current account transactions in the future. If the foreign exchange control system prevents us from obtaining sufficient foreign currency to satisfy our currency demands, we may not be able to pay certain of our expenses as they come due.\nThe fluctuation of the RMB may harm shareholder investments.\nThe value of the RMB against the U.S. dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in the PRC\u2019s political and economic conditions. Any significant revaluation of the RMB may materially and adversely affect our cash flows, revenue and financial condition. For example, to the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars we receive from an offering of our securities into RMB for our operations, appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar would diminish the value of the proceeds of the offering and could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Conversely, if we decide to convert our RMB into U.S. dollars for business purposes and the U.S. dollar appreciates against the RMB, the U.S. dollar equivalent of the RMB we convert would be reduced. In addition, the depreciation of significant U.S. dollar denominated assets could result in a charge to our income statement and a reduction in the value of these assets.\nPRC regulations relating to offshore investment activities by PRC residents may limit our PRC subsidiary\u2019s ability to increase its registered capital or distribute profits to us or otherwise expose us or our PRC resident beneficial owners to liability and penalties under PRC law.\nThe State Administration of Foreign Exchange or SAFE promulgated the Circular on Relevant Issues Relating to Domestic Resident\u2019s Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment through Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular 37, in July 2014 that requires PRC residents or entities to register with SAFE or its local branch in connection with their establishment or control of an offshore entity established for the purpose of overseas investment or financing. In addition, such PRC residents or entities must update their SAFE registrations when the offshore special purpose vehicle undergoes material events relating to any change of basic information (including change of such PRC citizens or residents, name, and operation term), increases or decreases in investment amount, transfers or exchanges of shares, or mergers or divisions. SAFE Circular 37 is issued to replace the Notice on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Administration for PRC Residents Engaging in Financing and Roundtrip Investments via Overseas Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular 75. SAFE promulgated the Notice on Further Simplifying and Improving the Administration of the Foreign Exchange Concerning Direct Investment in February 2015, which took effect on June 1, 2015. This notice has amended SAFE Circular 37 requiring PRC residents or entities to register with qualified banks rather than SAFE or its local branch in connection with their establishment or control of an offshore entity established for the purpose of overseas investment or financing.\nIf our shareholders who are PRC residents or entities do not complete their registration as required, our PRC subsidiary may be prohibited from distributing its profits and proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation to us, and we may be restricted in our ability to contribute additional capital to our PRC subsidiary.\nThe failure or inability of the relevant shareholders to comply with the registration procedures set forth in these regulations may subject us to fines and legal sanctions, such as restrictions on our cross-border investment activities, on the ability of our wholly foreign-owned subsidiaries in China to distribute dividends and the proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation to us. Moreover, failure to comply with the various foreign exchange registration requirements described above could result in liability under PRC law for circumventing applicable foreign exchange restrictions. As a result, our business operations and our ability to distribute profits to you could be materially and adversely affected.\nAny failure to comply with PRC regulations regarding the registration requirements for employee stock incentive plans may subject the PRC plan participants or us to fines and other legal or administrative sanctions.\nIn February 2012, SAFE promulgated the Notices on Issues Concerning the Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Stock Incentive Plan of Overseas Publicly-Listed Company, replacing earlier rules promulgated in March 2007. Pursuant to these rules, PRC citizens and non-PRC citizens who reside in China for a continuous period of not less than one year who participate in any stock incentive plan of an overseas publicly listed company, subject to a few exceptions, are required to register with SAFE through a domestic qualified agent, which could be the PRC subsidiary of such overseas listed company, and complete certain other procedures. In addition, an overseas entrusted institution must be retained to handle matters in connection with the exercise or sale of stock options and the purchase or sale of shares and interests. We and our executive officers and other employees who are PRC citizens or who have resided in the PRC for a continuous period of not less than one year will be subject to these regulations. Failure to complete the SAFE registrations may subject them to fines and legal sanctions and may also limit our ability to contribute additional capital into our PRC subsidiary and limit our PRC subsidiary\u2019s ability to distribute dividends to us. We also face regulatory uncertainties that could restrict our ability to adopt additional incentive plans for our directors, executive officers and employees under PRC law.\nRegulatory bodies of the United States may be limited in their ability to conduct investigations or inspections of our operations in China.\nFrom time to time, the Company may receive requests from certain U.S. agencies to investigate or inspect the Company\u2019s operations, or to otherwise provide information. While the Company will be compliant with these requests from these regulators, there is no guarantee that such requests will be honored by those entities who provide services to us or with whom we associate, especially as those entities are located in China. Furthermore, an on-site inspection of our facilities by any of these regulators may be limited or entirely prohibited. Such inspections, though permitted by the Company and its affiliates, are subject to the unpredictability of the Chinese enforcers, and may therefore be impossible to facilitate.\nBecause our principal assets are located outside of the United States, it may be difficult for investors to use U.S. securities laws to enforce their rights against us, our officers and some of our directors in the United States or to enforce judgments of United States courts against us or them in the PRC.\nMost of our present officers and directors reside outside of the United States. In addition, all of our subsidiaries and assets are located outside of the United States. Therefore, it may be difficult for investors in the United States to enforce their legal rights based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. securities laws against us in the courts of either the United States or the PRC and, even if civil judgments are obtained in courts of the United States, to enforce such judgments in the PRC courts. Further, it is unclear if extradition treaties now in effect between the United States and the PRC would permit effective enforcement against us or our officers and directors of criminal penalties under the U.S. Federal securities laws or otherwise.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nWe are authorized to issue blank check preferred stock, which may be issued without shareholder approval and which may adversely affect the rights of holders of our Common Stock.\nWe are authorized to issue 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The Board is authorized under our articles of incorporation, as amended, to provide for the issuance of shares of preferred stock by resolution and by filing a certificate of designations under Florida law, to fix the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each such series of preferred stock and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof without any further vote or action by the shareholders. As of December 31, 2020, there were no shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding. Any shares of preferred stock that are issued are likely to have priority over our Common Stock with respect to dividend or liquidation rights. In the event of issuance, the preferred stock could be utilized under certain circumstances as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control, which could have the effect of discouraging bids to acquire us and thereby prevent shareholders from receiving the maximum value for their shares. We have no present intention to issue any shares of preferred stock in order to discourage or delay a change of control or for any other reason. However, there can be no assurance that preferred stock will not be issued at some time in the future.\nZeyao Xue has control over key decision making as a result of his control of a substantial amount of our voting stock.\nMr. Zeyao Xue, the son of our Chairman of the Board of Directors, indirectly and directly beneficially owns 13,012,622 shares, or approximately 19.93%, of our outstanding common stock as of April 12, 2021. Mr. Zeyao Xue\u2019s beneficial ownership of 19.93% of Future FinTech\u2019s issued and outstanding common stock will likely give him the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to shareholders for approval, including but not limited to the election of directors and any merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets. This concentrated control could delay, defer, or prevent a change of control, merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets that other shareholders support, or conversely this concentrated control could result in the consummation of such a transaction that other shareholders do not support. This concentrated control could also discourage a potential investor from acquiring the common stock of the Company due to the limited voting power of such shares. As a shareholder, even a controlling shareholder, Mr. Zeyao Xue is entitled to vote his shares, and shares over which he has voting control, in his own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our shareholders generally.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Florida law could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our Company and may affect the trading price of our Common Stock.\nAs a Florida corporation, we are subject to certain provisions of the Florida Business Corporation Act that have anti-takeover effects and may inhibit a non-negotiated merger or other business combination. Our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws also contain other provisions which could have anti-takeover effects. These provisions include, without limitation, the authority of our Board of Directors to issue additional shares of preferred stock and to fix the relative rights and preferences of the preferred stock without the need for any shareholder vote or approval, as discussed above, and advance notice procedures to be complied with by our shareholders in order to make shareholder proposals or nominate directors, such as:\n\u25cf authorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by the Board to thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u25cf require that directors only be removed from office upon a majority shareholder vote;\n\u25cf provide that vacancies on the board of directors, including newly created directorships, may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office;\n\u25cf limit who may call special meetings of shareholders; and\nFor more information regarding these and other provisions, see the exhibit titled \u201cDescription of Our Securities - Anti-Takeover Effects of Certain Provisions of Florida Law.\u201d\nIn recent years, our Common Stock has been in danger of being delisted from the NASDAQ Stock Market (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d).\nOn February 28, 2019, the Company received a letter from NASDAQ notifying the Company that, because the closing bid price for the Company\u2019s common stock listed on NASDAQ was below $1.00 for 30 consecutive trading days, the Company no longer met the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on NASDAQ under NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5550(a)(2). On May 7, 2019, the Company received a written notification from the NASDAQ Stock Market Listing Qualifications Staff indicating that the Company has regained compliance with the $1.00 minimum closing bid price requirement and that the matter is now closed.\nOn April 17, 2019, the Company received a notification letter from NASDAQ stating the Company was not in compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), due to its failure to timely file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 (the \u201c2018 10-K\u201d). On May 21, 2019, the Company received a notification letter from NASDAQ stating the Company was not in compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), due to its failure to timely file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2019. On August 20, 2019, the Company received a notification letter from the NASDAQ stating the Company was not in compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), due to its failure to timely file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2019.\nOn October 16, 2019, the Company received a letter from the NASDAQ notifying the Company that it has regained compliance with NASDAQ\u2019s periodic filing requirements for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. The letter noted that as a result of the September 3, 2019 filing of the Form 10-K for the year ended on December 31, 2018 and the September 30, 2019 filing of the Forms 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, and June 30, 2019 with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company has regained compliance with Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) and the matter is now closed.\nOn September 4, 2019, the Company received written notice from the NASDAQ stating that the Company did not meet the requirement of maintaining a minimum of $2,500,000 in stockholders\u2019 equity for continued listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market, as set forth in NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(b)(1), the Company also does not meet the alternative of market value of listed securities of $35 million under NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(b)(2) or net income from continuing operations of $500,000 in the most recently completed fiscal year or in two of the last three most recently completed fiscal years under NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(b)(3), and the Company is no longer in compliance with the NASDAQ Listing Rules. On March 18, 2020, the Company received written notice form NASDAQ stating that the Company complies with the Listing Rule 5550(b)(1).\nOn November 4, 2019, the Company received a letter from the Nasdaq notifying the Company that, because the closing bid price for the Company\u2019s common stock listed on Nasdaq was below $1.00 for 30 consecutive trading days, the Company no longer meets the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on Nasdaq under Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5550(a)(2), which requires a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share. On April 14, 2020, the Company received a written notification from the Nasdaq indicating that the Company has regained compliance with the $1.00 minimum closing bid price requirement and that the matter is now closed.", "PERMNO": 93069, "SIC": 2080, "TIC": "FTFT"}
