{"cik": "918160", "company": "AK STEEL HOLDING CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-20", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nWe caution readers that our business activities involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those we currently expect. While the items listed below represent the most significant risks to us, we regularly monitor and report risks to the Board of Directors through a formal Total Enterprise Risk Management program.\nRisk of reduced selling prices, shipments and profits associated with a highly competitive and cyclical industry. The competitive landscape in the steel industry reflects shifting domestic and international political priorities, an uncertain global trade landscape, and intense competition from domestic and foreign competitors producing steel and substitute products. These conditions directly impact our pricing. It is impossible to predict whether the domestic and/or global economies or industry sectors of those economies that are key to our sales will continue to improve and generate enough demand to absorb some of the existing excess capacity in the steel industry, as well as new or expanded capacity. Also, we cannot know how customers or competitors will react to these and other factors and how their actions could affect market dynamics and sales of, and prices for, our products. Market price and demand for steel are very hard to predict and decreases in either or both could adversely impact our sales, financial results and cash flows. In addition, our direct sales to the automotive industry generate approximately 66% of our revenue and we make additional sales to distributors and converters whom, we believe, ultimately resell some of that volume to the automotive market. If automotive demand should decline substantially or we lose market share to competitors, our sales, financial results and cash flows could be severely impacted.\n- 10-\nRisk of domestic and global steel overcapacity. Significant global steel capacity and new or expanded production capacity in North America in recent years has caused and continues to cause capacity to exceed demand globally, as well as in our primary markets in North America. In fact, significant increases in new production capacity and a restart of previously idled capacity in the U.S. by our competitors has occurred in recent periods, as new carbon and stainless steelmaking and finishing facilities have begun or may soon begin production. In addition, foreign competitors have substantially increased their production capacity in the last few years and, in some instances appear to have targeted the U.S. market for imports. Also, some foreign economies, such as China, have slowed relative to recent historical norms, resulting in an increased volume of steel products that cannot be consumed by industries in those foreign steel producers\u2019 own countries. Although import levels of carbon and stainless flat-rolled products into the United States have shown a gradual and steady decline over the past two years, imports of other steel products remain at historic highs and the risk remains of even greater levels of imports, depending upon foreign market and economic conditions, changes in trade agreements and treaties, laws, regulations or government policies affecting trade, the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, and other variables beyond our control. A significant further increase in domestic capacity or foreign imports could adversely affect our sales, financial results and cash flows.\nRisks related to U.S. government actions on trade agreements and treaties, laws, regulations or policies affecting trade. Under the Trump Administration, the U.S. government has altered its approach to international trade policy, both generally and with respect to the matters directly and indirectly affecting the steel industry. In recent years, the U.S. government undertook certain unilateral actions affecting trade and also renegotiated existing bilateral or multi-lateral trade agreements or entered into new agreements or treaties with foreign countries. For example, in March 2018, President Trump signed a proclamation pursuant to Section 232 imposing a 25 percent tariff on imported steel. In retaliation against the Section 232 tariffs, the European Union subsequently imposed its own tariffs against certain steel products and other goods imported from the U.S. If the Section 232 tariffs are removed or substantially lessened, whether through legal challenge, legislation or otherwise, imports of foreign steel would likely increase and steel prices in the U.S. would likely fall, which would materially adversely affect our sales, financial results and cash flows. In addition, on December 10, 2019, representatives of the U.S., Mexico and Canada signed a revision to the United States-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement (\u201cUSMCA\u201d), which was proposed to replace the existing North American Free Trade Agreement (\u201cNAFTA\u201d) among those countries. On January 29, 2020, President Trump signed the USMCA Implementation Act on behalf of the U.S. Because all of our manufacturing facilities are located in North America and our principal market is automotive manufacturing in North America, we believe that the USMCA has the potential to positively impact our business by incentivizing automakers and other manufacturers to increase manufacturing production in North America and to use North American steel. However, it is difficult to predict the short- and long-term implications of changes in trade policy and, therefore, whether USMCA or other new or renegotiated trade agreements, treaties, laws, regulations or policies will have a beneficial or detrimental impact on our business and our customers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 business. Adverse effects could occur directly from a disruption to trade and commercial transactions and/or indirectly by adversely affecting the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof, thereby impacting demand for our customers\u2019 products, and in turn negatively affecting demand for our products. Key links of the supply chain for some of our key customers, including automotive manufacturers, could be negatively impacted by USMCA or other new or renegotiated trade agreements, treaties, laws, regulations of policies. Any of these actions and their direct and indirect impacts could materially adversely affect our sales, financial results and cash flows.\nRisk of changes in the cost of raw materials, supplies and energy. The price that we pay for energy, key supplies and raw materials, such as electricity, natural gas, industrial gases, graphite electrodes, iron ore, chrome, zinc and coal, can fluctuate significantly based on market factors. In some cases, the prices at which we sell steel will not change in tandem with changes in our raw materials, supplies and energy costs. Global demand and supply, particularly Chinese demand and supply, for certain raw materials can have a significant influence on our costs for those raw materials, especially iron ore and coal, as well as supplies for production whose prices are impacted by raw material prices, such as graphite electrodes and refractory materials. However, our sales prices are generally driven by North American demand, which can result in a compression in our margins in cases where raw material costs increase and our sales prices do not move enough to cover those increases. The majority of our shipments are sold under contracts that do not allow us to pass through all increases in raw materials, supplies and energy costs. Some of our shipments to contract customers include variable-pricing mechanisms allowing us to adjust the total sales price based upon changes in specified raw materials, supplies and energy costs. Those adjustments, however, rarely reflect all of our underlying raw materials, supplies and energy cost changes. The scope of the adjustment may also be limited by the terms of the negotiated language, including limitations on when the adjustment occurs. For shipments we make to the spot market, market conditions or timing of sales may not allow us to recover the full amount of an increase in raw material, supplies or energy costs. In such circumstances, a significant increase in raw material, supplies or energy costs likely would adversely impact our financial results and cash flows. Conversely, in certain circumstances, we may not realize all of the benefits when the price for certain raw materials, supplies or energy declines. For example, this can occur when we lock in the price of a raw material over a set period and the spot market price for the material declines during that period. Our need to consume existing inventories may also delay the impact of a change in prices of raw materials or supplies. New inventory may not be purchased until some portion of the existing inventory is consumed. The impact of this risk is particularly significant for iron ore and coke because of the volumes held in inventory. We manage our exposure to the risk of iron ore price increases by hedging a portion of our annual iron ore supply and by maintaining supply agreements where the IODEX, the global iron ore price index, is only one factor affecting our price of iron ore pellets. Significant changes in raw material costs may also\n- 11-\nincrease the potential for inventory value write-downs in the event of a reduction in selling prices and our inability to realize the cost of the inventory.\nRisk from our significant amount of debt and other obligations. On December 31, 2019, we had $1,997.3 of indebtedness outstanding. We also had pension and other postretirement benefit obligations totaling $758.8. We anticipate making approximately $45.0 of required annual pension contributions in 2020. Based on current funding projections, we expect to make contributions to the master pension trust of approximately $45.0 for 2021 and $35.0 for 2022, though funding projections for 2021 and beyond could be materially affected by differences between expected and actual returns on plan assets, actuarial data and assumptions relating to plan participants, the discount rate used to measure the pension obligations and changes to regulatory funding requirements. Furthermore, actions to reduce our pension obligations, such as transferring retiree obligations to insurance companies through purchased annuity contracts could accelerate the timing or increase the amount of contributions that we are required to make to the master pension trust. We also have the ability to borrow additional amounts under our $1,500.0 revolving credit facility (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d). At December 31, 2019, we had $450.0 of outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility with outstanding letters of credit of $72.5, resulting in maximum remaining availability of $977.5 under the Credit Facility, subject to customary borrowing conditions, including a borrowing base, which is determined by the value of eligible collateral less outstanding borrowings and letters of credit. At December 31, 2019, borrowing availability under the Credit Facility was $804.6 based on eligible collateral at that time. Our debt and pension obligations, along with other financial obligations, could have important consequences. For example, they could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; require a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to interest payments and debt service, reducing the amount of cash flows available for other purposes, such as working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures (\u201cJVs\u201d) or general corporate purposes; limit our ability to obtain future additional financing; reduce our planning flexibility for, or ability to react to, changes in our business and the industry; and place us at a competitive disadvantage with competitors who may have less indebtedness and other obligations or greater access to financing.\nRisk of severe financial hardship or bankruptcy of one or more of our major customers or key suppliers or JVs. Sales and operations of a majority of our customers are sensitive to general economic conditions, especially as they affect the North American automotive and housing industries. If there is a significant weakening of current economic conditions, whether because of secular or cyclical issues, it could lead to financial difficulties or even bankruptcy filings by our customers. The concentration of customers in a specific industry, such as the automotive industry, may increase our risk because of the likelihood that circumstances may affect multiple customers at the same time. The nature of that impact would likely include lost sales or losses associated with the potential inability to collect all outstanding accounts receivable. Such an event could also negatively impact our financial results and cash flows. In addition, some of our key suppliers, particularly those who supply us with critical raw materials for the steelmaking process, have recently faced severe financial challenges or bankruptcy and other suppliers or JVs may face such circumstances in the future. Also, we purchase all of our iron ore from Cliffs under two multi-year contracts. This reliance on a single supplier for a primary raw material may increase our risk of increased costs from substitute suppliers or supply chain disruptions. Key suppliers facing financial hardship or operating in bankruptcy could experience operational disruption or even face liquidation, which could result in our inability to secure replacement raw materials on a timely basis, or at all, or cause us to incur increased costs to do so. Such events could adversely impact our operations, financial results and cash flows.\nRisk related to our significant proportion of sales to the automotive market. In 2019, approximately 66% of our sales were to the automotive market. In addition to the size of our exposure to the automotive industry, we face risks related to our relative concentration of sales to certain specific automotive manufacturers. In 2019, two customers each accounted for 11% of our net sales. Automotive production and sales are cyclical and sensitive to general economic conditions and other factors, including interest rates, consumer credit, and consumer spending and preferences. If automotive production and sales decline, our sales and shipments to the automotive market are likely to decline in a corresponding manner. Adverse impacts that we may sustain as a result include, without limitation, lower margins because of the need to sell our steel to less profitable customers and markets, higher fixed costs from lower steel production if we are unable to sell the same amount of steel to other customers and markets, and/or lower sales, shipments and margins generally as our competitors face similar challenges and compete vigorously in other markets. These adverse impacts would negatively affect our sales, financial results and cash flows. Additionally, the trend toward lightweighting in the automotive industry, which requires lighter gauges of steel at higher strengths, could result in a lower volume of steel required by that industry over time. Moreover, competition for automotive business has intensified in recent years, as steel producers and companies producing alternative materials have focused their efforts on capturing and/or expanding their market share of automotive business because of less favorable conditions in other markets for steel and other metals, including commodity products and steel for use in the oil and gas markets. As a result, the potential exists that we may lose market share to existing or new entrants or that automotive manufacturers will take advantage of the intense competition among potential suppliers to pressure our pricing and margins in order to maintain or expand our market share with them, which could negatively affect our sales, financial results and cash flows.\nRisk of reduced demand in key product markets due to competition from aluminum and other alternatives to steel. The automotive market is important to our business, both in terms of volume and margins. Automotive manufacturers are under pressure to meet the government-mandated CAFE standards, which require increasing fuel economy for automobiles in the future. Automotive manufacturers have begun to incorporate aluminum and other alternative materials into their vehicles and continue to investigate the\n- 12-\npotential risks and benefits of expanding the use of non-steel materials. For example, one major automotive company has begun substituting aluminum for carbon steel in the body of some of its vehicles. Although automotive manufacturers have incorporated aluminum and other competing materials at a much slower rate than some experts previously expected, if demand for steel from one or more of our major automotive customers was to significantly decline because of increased use of aluminum or other competing materials in substitution for steel, it likely would negatively affect our sales, financial results and cash flows.\nRisks of excess inventory of raw materials. We have certain raw material supply contracts that include minimum annual purchases, subject to exceptions for force majeure and other circumstances. If our need for a particular raw material is reduced for an extended period significantly below what we projected at the contract\u2019s inception, or what we projected at the time an annual nomination was made under certain contracts, we could be required to purchase quantities of raw materials that exceed our anticipated annual needs. If our existing supply contracts require us to purchase raw materials in quantities beyond our needs, and if we do not succeed in reaching an agreement with a particular raw material supplier to reduce the quantity of raw materials we purchase from that supplier, then we would likely be required to purchase more of a particular raw material in a given year than we need, negatively affecting our financial results, liquidity and cash flows.\nRisk of supply chain disruptions or poor quality of raw materials or supplies. Our sales, financial results and cash flows could be adversely affected by transportation, raw material, energy or other key supply disruptions, or poor quality of raw materials, particularly scrap, coal, coke, iron ore and alloys. In addition, we may experience supply chain disruptions or increased costs from transportation-related challenges due to new or enhanced regulation, changes to providers\u2019 operations, labor shortages or other factors. Disruptions or quality issues, whether the result of severe financial hardships or bankruptcies of suppliers, natural or man-made disasters, other adverse weather events, or other unforeseen events, could reduce production or increase costs at one or more of our plants and potentially adversely affect customers or markets to which we sell our products. Any significant disruption or quality issue in any of the areas addressed above would adversely affect our sales, financial results and cash flows.\nRisk of production disruption or reduced production levels. When business conditions permit, we attempt to operate our facilities at production levels that are at or near capacity. High production levels are important to our financial results because they enable us to spread fixed costs over a greater number of production tons. We have implemented a strategy to target markets for our products that deliver higher margins, where possible, and reduce amounts sold into the typically lower-margin spot markets. This ongoing strategy relies on our ability to sell higher-margin products that overcome the effects of lower production volumes on our fixed costs. If we are unable to sustain this strategy successfully, it would adversely affect our sales, financial results and cash flows. Production disruptions at facilities we own or at our joint ventures could be caused by unanticipated plant outages or equipment failures, a lack of redundancy for key production assets, or lack of adequate raw materials, energy or other supplies, particularly under circumstances where we lack adequate redundant facilities. Production disruptions could result in significant costs and potential liability to us, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation with current or potential customers. In addition, the occurrence of natural or man-made disasters, adverse weather conditions or similar events could significantly disrupt our operations, negatively impact the operations of other companies or contractors we depend upon, or adversely affect customers or markets who buy our products. Any significant disruption or reduced level of production would adversely affect our sales, financial results and cash flows.\nRisks associated with our healthcare obligations. We provide healthcare coverage to our active employees and to a significant portion of our retirees, as well as certain members of their families. We are self-insured for substantially all of our healthcare coverage. While we have reduced our exposure to rising healthcare costs to a significant degree through cost sharing, cost caps and VEBA trusts, the cost of providing such healthcare coverage may be greater on a relative basis for us than for our competitors because they either provide a lower level of benefits, require that their participants pay more for their benefits, or do not provide coverage to as broad a group of participants (e.g., they do not provide retiree healthcare benefits). In addition, our costs for retiree healthcare obligations could be affected by fluctuations in interest rates or by federal healthcare legislation.\nRisks associated with our pension obligations. We have a substantial pension obligation that, along with the related pension expense (income) and funding requirements, is directly affected by various changes in assumptions, including the selection of appropriate mortality assumptions and discount rates. These items also are affected by the rate and timing of employee retirements, actual experience compared to actuarial projections and asset returns in the securities markets. Such changes could increase our cost for those obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results and ability to meet those obligations. In addition, changes in the laws governing pensions could also materially adversely affect our costs and ability to meet our pension obligations. Also, under the method of accounting we use for pension obligation reporting, we recognize into our results of operations, as a \u201ccorridor\u201d adjustment, any unrecognized actuarial net gains or losses that exceed 10% of the larger of projected benefit obligations or plan assets. These corridor adjustments are driven mainly by changes in assumptions and by events and circumstances beyond our control, primarily changes in interest rates, performance of the financial markets, and mortality and retirement projections. A corridor adjustment, if required after a re-measurement of our pension obligations, historically has been recorded in the fourth quarter of the year, though one may be recorded at any time if an interim remeasurement occurs. A corridor adjustment can have a significant impact on our financial statements when it occurs, although its immediate recognition reduces the impact of unrealized gains or losses on future periods. A corridor charge does not have any immediate impact on our cash flows. We also contribute to multiemployer pension\n- 13-\nplans according to collective bargaining agreements that cover certain union-represented employees. Participating in these multiemployer plans exposes us to potential liabilities if the multiemployer plan is unable to pay its underfunded obligations or we choose to stop participating in the plan. For example, in 2019 the trustees for the IAM National Pension Fund (the \u201cFund\u201d) voluntarily elected to place the Fund in the Red Zone for 2019 and implement a rehabilitation plan, which requires both an increase in employer contributions and reduction of certain employee pension benefits. Depending on negotiations with one of our affected unions, our contributions to the Fund could increase approximately $2.0 in 2020, with gradually increasing requirements through 2031.\nRisk of not reaching new labor agreements on a timely basis. Most of our hourly employees are represented by various labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements with expiration dates between March 2020 and July 2023. One of those contracts is scheduled to expire in 2020. The labor contract with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, Local 1943, which governs approximately 1,750 production employees at Middletown Works, expires on March 15, 2020. We intend to negotiate with the union to reach a new, competitive labor agreement in advance of the current expiration date. We cannot predict, however, when a new, competitive labor agreement with the union will be reached or what the impact of such agreement will be on our operating costs, operating income and cash flows. There is the potential of a work stoppage at this location in 2020 and beyond if we cannot reach timely agreement in contract negotiations before the contract expiration. If a work stoppage occurs, it could have a material impact on our operations, financial results and cash flows. For labor contracts at other locations that expire after 2020, a similar risk applies.\nRisks associated with major litigation, arbitrations, environmental issues and other contingencies. We have described several significant legal and environmental proceedings in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. For environmental issues, changes in application or scope of laws or regulations applicable to us, or negative outcomes in pending or future litigation, could have significant adverse impacts, including requiring capital expenditures to ensure compliance with the laws, regulations, or court decisions, increased difficulty in obtaining future permits or meeting future permit requirements, incurring costs for emission allowances, restriction of production, and higher prices for certain raw materials. One or more of these adverse developments could negatively impact our operations, financial results and cash flows. For litigation, arbitrations and other legal proceedings, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of such matters and we could incur future judgments, fines or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits, arbitrations and claims that could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, while we maintain insurance coverage for certain claims, we may not be able to obtain insurance on acceptable terms in the future and, if we obtain such insurance, it may not provide adequate coverage against all claims. We establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies, including contingencies for claims asserted against us in connection with litigation, arbitrations and environmental issues. Adverse developments in litigation, arbitrations, environmental issues or other legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments in excess of our reserves, which could negatively affect our operations, financial results and cash flows.\nRisk associated with regulatory compliance and changes. Our business and the businesses of our customers and suppliers are subject to a wide variety of government regulations, including those relating to environmental permitting requirements. The regulations promulgated or adopted by various government agencies, and the interpretations and application of such regulations, are dynamic and constantly evolving. If new regulations arise, the application of existing regulations expands, or the interpretation of applicable regulations changes, we may incur additional costs for compliance, including capital expenditures. For example, the EPA is required to routinely reassess the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (\u201cNAAQS\u201d) for criteria pollutants like nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, lead, ozone and particulate matter. These standards are frequently subject to litigation and revision. Revisions to the NAAQS could require us to make significant capital expenditures to ensure compliance and could make it more difficult for us to obtain required permits in the future. These risks are higher for our facilities that are located in non-attainment areas. Complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations apply to our domestic and international operations, including but not limited to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery laws, regulations related to import/export controls, the Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctions program, anti-boycott provisions, the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) and other U.S. and foreign privacy regulations, and transportation and logistics regulations. These laws and regulations and changes in these laws and regulations may increase our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions and expose our operations and our employees to elevated risk. We have implemented policies and processes designed to comply with these laws and regulations, but failure by our employees, contractors or agents to comply with these laws and regulations could result in possible administrative, civil or criminal liability and reputational harm to us and our employees. We may also be indirectly affected through regulatory changes that impact our customers or suppliers. Regulatory changes that impact our customers could reduce the quantity of our products they demand or the price of our products that they are willing to pay. Regulatory changes that impact our suppliers could decrease the supply of products or availability of services they sell to us or could increase the price they demand for products or services they sell to us.\nRisks associated with climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. Our business and operations, as well as the business and operations of our key suppliers and customers, may become subject to legislation or regulation intended to limit climate change or greenhouse gas emissions. It is possible that limitations on, or taxes or other assessments related to, greenhouse gas emissions may be imposed in the United States through legislation or regulation. For example, the EPA has issued and/or proposed regulations addressing greenhouse gas emissions, including regulations that will require large sources and suppliers in the United States to report\n- 14-\ngreenhouse gas emissions. In addition, the U.S. Congress has introduced from time to time legislation aimed at limiting carbon emissions from carbon-intensive business operations. The CAFE standards and other existing and future climate change-related legislation and regulation could also affect our customers, and in particular our automotive customers, as they may elect to use lower volumes of steel to achieve mandates related to emissions. Similarly, our suppliers may incur cost increases in order to comply with climate control legislation and regulation, which they could in turn attempt to pass through to us in the form of higher prices for critical goods and services. It is impossible to forecast the terms of the final regulations and legislation, if any, and the resulting effects on us. Depending upon the terms of any such legislation or regulation, we could suffer negative financial impacts because of increased energy, operational, environmental and other costs to comply with the limitations that would be imposed on greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, depending upon whether similar limitations are imposed globally, the regulations and/or legislation could negatively impact our ability to compete with foreign steel companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations. Until all of the terms of such regulation and legislation are known, we cannot reasonably or reliably estimate their impact on our financial condition, operating performance or ability to compete.\nRisks associated with financial, credit, capital and banking markets. In the ordinary course of business, we seek to access financial, credit, capital and banking markets at competitive rates. Currently, we believe we have adequate access to these markets to meet our reasonably anticipated business needs. We provide and receive normal trade financing to our customers and from our suppliers. If access to competitive financial, credit, capital and banking markets by us, or our customers or suppliers, is impaired, our operations, financial results and cash flows could be adversely impacted.\nRisk associated with derivative contracts to hedge commodity pricing volatility. We use cash-settled commodity price swaps and options to reduce pricing volatility for a portion of our raw material, energy and other commodity purchases. We employ a systematic approach in order to mitigate the risk of potential volatile price movements of certain commodities. This approach is intended to protect us against a sharp rise in the price of commodities. However, engaging in the use of swaps, options and similar agreements for hedging entails a variety of risks. For example, if the price of an underlying commodity falls below the price at which we hedged the commodity, we will benefit from the lower market price for the commodity purchased, but may not realize the full benefit of the lower commodity price because of the hedged transaction. In certain circumstances we also could be required to provide collateral for a potential derivative liability or close our hedging transaction for the commodity. Additionally, there may be a timing lag (particularly for iron ore) between a decline in the price of a commodity underlying a derivative contract, which could require us to make payments in the short-term to provide collateral or settle the relevant hedging transaction, and the period when we experience the benefits of the lower cost input through physical purchases of the commodity the hedge covers. Further, for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, we initially record the effective gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassify them to earnings in the same period we recognize the effect of the associated hedged transaction. We record all derivative gains or losses for which hedge accounting treatment has not been elected to earnings in the period the gain or loss occurs. Changes in the fair value of derivatives for which hedge accounting treatment has not been elected may result in increased volatility in our reported earnings. For example, we immediately recognize changes in the fair value of our iron ore derivative contracts in earnings when the fair value changes, instead of when we recognize the underlying cost of iron ore, thus potentially increasing the volatility of our results of operations. Each of these risks related to our hedging transactions could adversely affect our financial results and cash flows.\nRisks related to the potential permanent idling of facilities. We perform strategic reviews of our business on an ongoing basis, which includes evaluating each of our plants and operating units to assess their strategic benefits, competitiveness and viability. As part of these reviews, we may idle-whether temporarily or permanently-certain of our existing facilities in order to reduce or eliminate participation in markets where we determine that our returns are not acceptable. For example, in 2019 we permanently closed our Ashland Works plant. Our closure of Ashland Works resulted in the incurrence and acceleration of cash expenses, including those relating to labor benefit obligations, a multiemployer plan withdrawal liability, take-or-pay supply agreements and accelerated environmental remediation costs, as well as charges for impairment of those assets and the effects on pension and OPEB liabilities. Other risks associated with the closure of Ashland Works include, without limitation, our failure to achieve the projected savings and higher than expected closure costs. For operations other than Ashland Works, we could incur similar types of cash and non-cash costs if we elect to temporarily or permanently idle any of our other currently operating assets or facilities as part of our ongoing strategic reviews. We will generally endeavor to transition products produced at an affected operation to our other facilities, including joint ventures. Customers could respond negatively to this requested transition and take current or future business from us. Alternatively, we could fail to meet customer specifications at the facilities to which these products will be transitioned, resulting in customer dissatisfaction or claims, or face other unanticipated operational issues. If we elect to permanently idle other material facilities or assets, it could adversely affect our operations, financial results and cash flows.\nRisk of inability to fully realize benefits of margin enhancement initiatives. In recent years we have undertaken several significant projects in an effort to lower costs and enhance margins. These projects and initiatives include efforts to focus production and sales on higher margin products, increase our operating rates and lower our costs. We identified a number of areas for enhancing profitability, including increasing our percentage of contract sales, producing and selling a greater value-added mix of products and developing new products that can command higher prices from customers. For example, we expect Precision Partners to continue to grow as it expands its operations and capabilities with revenues that can realize higher margins than our average business. Goodwill is a significant part\n- 15-\nof Precision Partners\u2019 assets and our inability to realize the benefits of the growth in its business model could result in an impairment of goodwill. As another example, we have recently undertaken several significant information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) projects, including new and upgraded enterprise systems that affect key areas of our business and operations. Although we anticipate that these IT projects will increase our efficiency, should these projects face unexpected challenges, whether during implementation, adoption or other stages, it could have adverse impacts on our business or operations. Generally, if one or more of these key cost-savings or margin enhancement projects are unsuccessful, are significantly less effective in achieving the level and timing of combined cost savings or margin enhancement than we anticipated, or do not achieve results as quickly as anticipated, our financial results and cash flows could be adversely impacted.\nRisk of IT security threats, cybercrime and exposure of private information. We rely on IT systems and networks in almost every aspect of our business activities. In addition, we and certain of our third-party data processing providers collect and store sensitive data, and our vendors or suppliers may collect and store sensitive data about us in their information system environments. We have taken, and intend to continue to take, what we believe are appropriate and reasonable steps to prevent security breaches in our systems and networks. In recent years, however, both the number and sophistication of IT security threats and cybercrimes have increased. Additionally, regulatory pressure has increased for companies to prevent security breaches and notify stakeholders if data is exposed. These IT security threats and increasingly sophisticated cybercrimes pose a risk to system security and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. A breach in security could expose us to risks of production downtimes and operations disruptions, misuse of information or systems, or the compromise of confidential information, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, competitive position, business and financial results.\nRisks associated with changes in tax laws and regulations. We are a large corporation with operations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. As such, we are subject to tax laws and regulations of the U.S. federal, state and local governments, as well as various foreign jurisdictions. We compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax provision for income taxes. Changes in tax laws or regulations may be enacted that could adversely affect our overall tax assets and liabilities. Any changes in enacted tax laws, rules or regulatory or judicial interpretations, any adverse outcome in connection with tax audits in any jurisdiction, or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks related to the uncertain consideration our stockholders will receive in the Merger because the market price of Cliffs common shares will fluctuate. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, upon consummation of the Merger, each share of our common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (other than restricted shares and shares of our common stock owned by us, Cliffs or Merger Sub) will be converted into the right to receive 0.40 Cliffs common shares (as well as cash in lieu of any fractional Cliffs common shares and any dividends or distributions on the Cliffs common shares with a record date at or after the effective time of the Merger). The exchange ratio in the Merger is fixed, and there will be no adjustment to the consideration to be received by our stockholders in the Merger for changes in the market price of Cliffs common shares or our common stock prior to the completion of the Merger. The market value of Cliffs common shares may fluctuate prior to the closing of the transaction as a result of a variety of factors, including general market and economic conditions, changes in Cliffs\u2019 business, operations and prospects and regulatory considerations. Such factors are difficult to predict and in many cases may be beyond our control or Cliff\u2019s control. The actual value of the consideration to be received by our stockholders at the completion of the Merger will depend on the market value of the Cliffs common shares at that time. This market value may differ, possibly materially, from the market value of Cliffs common shares at the time the Merger Agreement was entered into or at any other time.\nRisk that the Merger Agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the Merger may not be completed. The Merger Agreement contains a number of conditions that must be satisfied or waived in order to complete the Merger. Those conditions include, among others:\n\u2022\nthe adoption of the Merger Agreement by our stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe approval by Cliffs shareholders of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the issuance of Cliffs common shares in connection with the Merger;\n\u2022\nthe approval to list the Cliffs common shares issuable in connection with the Merger on the NYSE;\n\u2022\nthe expiration or termination of the antitrust waiting period applicable to the Merger and receipt of required regulatory approvals in Mexico;\n\u2022\nthe absence of any governmental order or law prohibiting the consummation of the Merger;\n\u2022\nthe accuracy of Cliffs\u2019 and our respective representations and warranties under the Merger Agreement (subject to the materiality standards set forth in the Merger Agreement);\n\u2022\nCliffs\u2019 and our performance of their respective obligations under the Merger Agreement in all material respects;\n\u2022\nthe absence of a material adverse effect on Cliffs (as described in the Merger Agreement); and\n\u2022\nour receipt of a written opinion of our tax counsel (or, if our tax counsel is unwilling or unable to deliver such tax opinion, Cliffs\u2019 tax counsel, or, if Cliffs\u2019 tax counsel does not deliver such an opinion, subject to our using reasonable best efforts to\n- 16-\nobtain the tax opinion from another nationally recognized tax counsel reasonably acceptable to us) regarding the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the transaction.\nThese conditions to the closing of the Merger may not be fulfilled in a timely manner or at all, and, accordingly, the Merger may be delayed or may not be completed. In addition, if the Merger is not completed by June 30, 2020 (subject to our and Cliffs\u2019 ability to extend the date to September 30, 2020 and then December 31, 2020 if required antitrust approvals have not yet been obtained or there is an impediment under any antitrust law), either Cliffs or we may choose not to proceed with the Merger. The parties can mutually decide to terminate the Merger Agreement at any time, before or after the receipt of our stockholder approval or Cliffs shareholder approval.\nRisk that an adverse ruling in one or more lawsuits filed against AK Steel, its directors, Cliffs, its directors and Merger Sub in connection with the Merger may delay the completion of the Merger or prevent the Merger from being completed. Six actions, including one putative class action lawsuit, have been filed in federal court in Delaware, Michigan and New York by purported stockholders of ours in connection with the Merger: the Stein Action, Spuhler Action, Franchi Action, Raul Action, Ruiz Action and Rubin Action (collectively, the \u201cAK Steel Stockholder Federal Actions\u201d, each as defined and described in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). A seventh action, the Pate Action (as defined and described in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements), has been filed by a purported AK Steel stockholder as a putative class action in state court in Ohio (the Pate Action and the AK Steel Stockholder Federal Actions are collectively referred to as the \u201cAK Steel Stockholder Actions.\u201d). Each of the AK Steel Stockholder Actions names AK Steel and its directors as defendants, and the Franchi Action and Pate Action each name Cliffs and Merger Sub as additional defendants. An eighth action, the Nessim Action (as defined and described in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements), has been filed in federal court in New York against Cliffs and its directors by a purported shareholder of Cliffs (the Nessim Action and the AK Steel Stockholder Federal Actions are collectively referred to as the \u201cFederal Stockholder Actions,\u201d and all eight actions are collectively referred to as the \u201cStockholder Actions.\u201d). Each of the Federal Stockholder Actions alleges, among other things, that the registration statement on Form S-4 filed by Cliffs in connection with the Merger is false and misleading and/or omits material information concerning the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), and Rule 14a-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act. The Pate Action alleges breach of fiduciary duty claims against the AK Steel directors and aiding and abetting claims against AK Steel, Cliffs and Merger Sub in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including that the registration statement on Form S-4 filed by Cliffs in connection with the Merger is false and misleading and/or omits material information concerning the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The plaintiffs in the Stockholder Actions, among other things, seek to enjoin the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses.\nAdditional lawsuits related to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement may be filed in the future. Even if the lawsuits are without merit, these claims can result in substantial costs and divert management time and resources. There can be no assurance that any of the defendants will be successful in defending the pending or any potential future lawsuits. A preliminary injunction could delay or jeopardize the completion of the Merger, and an adverse judgment granting permanent injunctive relief could indefinitely enjoin the completion of the Merger. An adverse judgment in any Stockholder Action could result in monetary damages, which could have a negative impact on Cliffs\u2019 and AK Steel\u2019s respective liquidity and financial condition.\nRisk of negative impacts on the price of shares of our common stock and our debt securities, our future business and financial results as a result of failing to complete the Merger. If the Merger is not completed for any reason, including the failure of either company\u2019s stockholders to approve the requisite transactions, our business and financial results may be adversely affected, including as follows:\n\u2022\nwe may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on the market price of our common stock and debt securities;\n\u2022\nthe manner in which customers, vendors, business partners and other third parties perceive us may be negatively impacted, which in turn could affect our ability to compete for new business or obtain renewals in the marketplace more broadly;\n\u2022\nwe may experience negative reactions from employees, which may adversely affect, among other things, productivity, employee turnover and occupational safety; and\n\u2022\nwe have and will continue to expend significant time and resources that could otherwise have been spent on our existing businesses and the pursuit of other opportunities that could have been beneficial to us, and our ongoing business and financial results may be adversely affected.\nIn addition to the above risks, if the Merger Agreement is terminated and our board seeks an alternative transaction, our stockholders cannot be certain that we will be able to find a party willing to engage in a transaction on more attractive terms than the Merger. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, we also may be required to pay Cliffs a termination fee.\nRisks associated with the Merger Agreement limiting our ability to pursue alternatives to the Merger. The Merger Agreement contains provisions that may discourage a third party from submitting an acquisition proposal to us that might result in greater value to\n- 17-\nour stockholders than the Merger, or may result in a potential competing acquirer proposing to pay a lower per share price to acquire us than it might otherwise have proposed to pay. These provisions include a general prohibition on our soliciting or, subject to certain exceptions relating to the exercise of fiduciary duties by our board, entering into discussions with any third party regarding any acquisition proposal or offer for a competing transaction, and a termination fee that is payable to Cliffs if we terminate the Merger Agreement to accept a superior acquisition proposal.\nRisk of business uncertainties while the Merger is pending and related adverse effects on our business. Uncertainty about the effect of the Merger on employees, suppliers and customers may have an adverse effect on us. These uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Merger is completed, and could cause suppliers, customers and others that deal with us to seek to change our existing business relationships. In addition, the Merger Agreement restricts us from entering into certain corporate transactions and taking other specified actions without the consent of Cliffs, and generally requires us to continue our operations in the ordinary course, until completion of the Merger. These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the Merger.\nRisk of the significant transaction and Merger-related costs exceeding our expectations. We have incurred and will incur substantial expenses in connection with the negotiation and completion of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including, among others, fees paid to financial, legal and accounting advisors, employee retention costs, severance and benefit costs and filing fees. Many of these costs will be borne by us even if the Merger is not completed and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nRisk that uncertainties associated with the Merger cause a loss of management personnel and other employees, which could adversely affect our future business and operations. We are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our officers and other employees to execute our business plans. Our success depends in part upon our ability to retain management personnel and other employees. Our current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their roles within the combined company following the Merger, which may have an adverse effect on our ability to attract or retain management and other personnel while the transaction is pending.", "PERMNO": 80303, "SIC": 3312, "TIC": "AKS"}
