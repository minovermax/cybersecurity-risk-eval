{"cik": "1320414", "company": "SELECT MEDICAL HOLDINGS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nIn addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, the following are important factors which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of us.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe unpredictable effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the duration and extent of disruption on our operations, creates uncertainties about our future operating results and financial condition.\nOver the past two years, the COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on our business and results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Its continuing impact on our business operations and financial condition will depend on a number of evolving factors and future developments that we are not able to predict, including, but not limited to, the duration of the outbreak; further actions by governmental authorities and the private sector to limit the spread of COVID-19; continued encouragement to social distance; and the economic impact of containment efforts on patients and communities we serve. Though availability of vaccines and reopening of state and local economies has improved the outlook for recovery from COVID-19's impacts, the impact of the Delta or Omicron variant or other new, more contagious or lethal variants that may emerge, the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against the Delta, Omicron, or other variants and the related responses by governments, including reinstated government-imposed lockdowns or other measures, cannot be predicted at this time.\nOur critical illness recovery hospitals and rehabilitation hospitals may continue to experience constrained staffing levels and increased operating costs resulting from increased usage of contract clinical labor due to the overwhelming need for healthcare professionals, particularly in areas that are heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, a shortage in labor due to quarantined employees, employees choosing not to return to work and increased labor costs could result from the latest variants of COVID-19. Our hospitals may experience increased operating costs resulting from shortages of medical supplies, including personal protective equipment, and supply chain disruptions. The payments we have received under the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund, also referred to as the Provider Relief Fund, for health care related expenses and lost revenues attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic have partially mitigated these issues. It is expected, however, that additional Provider Relief Funds will not be available to offset increased operating costs our hospitals have experienced and may continue to experience in the future.\nIn our outpatient rehabilitation clinics and Concentra centers, we may experience declines in demand for our services if governmental authorities resume mandates requiring the temporary closure of non-essential and non-life sustaining businesses. Our outpatient rehabilitation clinics may experience reductions in patient volume if governmental authorities suspend elective surgeries that normally increase the demand for outpatient services or if the operations of our referral sources experience disruption as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our clinics may experience a decline in workers\u2019 compensation injury visits and our Concentra centers may experience a reduction in workers\u2019 compensation and employer services visits as a result of business furloughs, employee quarantines, government vaccine mandates, or the temporary cessation or reduction of business operations.\nAdverse economic conditions in the U.S. or globally could adversely affect us.\nWe are subject to the risks arising from adverse conditions in the general economy. A U.S. or global recession or prolonged economic downturn could negatively impact our current and prospective patients, adversely affect the financial ability of health insurers to pay claims, adversely impact our ability to pay our expenses, and limit our ability to obtain financing for our operations. Healthcare spending in the U.S. could be negatively affected in the event of a downturn in economic conditions. For example, U.S. patients who have lost their jobs or healthcare coverage may no longer be covered by an employer-sponsored health insurance plan, and patients reducing their overall spending may elect to decrease the frequency of visits to our facilities or forgo elective treatments or procedures, thereby reducing demand for our services.\nWe could experience significant increases in costs for healthcare professionals due to labor shortages or union activity.\nWe have experienced and may continue to experience increased operating costs due to increased employee-related costs. A number of factors contribute to increased labor costs, such as constrained staffing due to a shortage of healthcare workers, increased dependence on contract clinical workers, the loss of unvaccinated employees in jurisdictions requiring vaccination, federal unemployment subsidies, including unemployment benefits offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and other government regulations, which include laws and regulations related to workers\u2019 health and safety.\nOur critical illness recovery hospitals and our rehabilitation hospitals are highly dependent on nurses, our outpatient rehabilitation division is highly dependent on therapists for patient care, and Concentra is highly dependent upon the ability of its affiliated professional groups to recruit and retain qualified physicians and other licensed providers. The market for qualified healthcare professionals is highly competitive. We have sometimes experienced difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified healthcare personnel and sometimes are forced to use agency clinical staff in our facilities, which can increase our costs and lower our margins. We cannot assure we will be able to attract and retain qualified healthcare professionals in the future. Additionally, the cost of attracting and retaining qualified healthcare personnel may be higher than we anticipate, and as a result, our profitability could decline. Labor shortages have also become more pronounced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Increased turnover rates within our employee base can lead to decreased efficiency and increased costs, such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased wage rates to attract and retain employees. There is no guarantee that the increase in labor costs will not continue in the future and, as a result, our profitability could decline.\nIn addition, United States healthcare providers are continuing to see an increase in the amount of union activity. Though we cannot predict the degree to which we will be affected by future union activity, there may be legislative or executive actions that could result in increased union activity.\nIf the frequency of workplace injuries and illnesses decline, Concentra\u2019s results may be negatively affected.\nApproximately 56% of Concentra\u2019s revenue in 2021 was generated from the treatment of workers\u2019 compensation claims. Concentra\u2019s business model is based, in part, on its ability to expand its relative share of the market for the treatment of claims for workplace injuries and illnesses. A recession or prolonged economic contraction as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could cause the workforce to decline, which may cause declines in workers\u2019 compensation claims. In addition, because of the greater access to health insurance and the fact that the United States economy has continued to shift from a manufacturing-based to a service-based economy along with general improvements in workplace safety, workers are generally healthier and less prone to work injuries. Increases in employer-sponsored wellness and health promotion programs have led to fitter and healthier employees who may be less likely to injure themselves on the job. If workplace injuries and illnesses decline at a greater rate than the increase in total employment, or if total employment declines at a greater rate than the increase in incident rates, the number of claims in the workers\u2019 compensation market will decrease and may adversely affect Concentra\u2019s business.\nIf Concentra loses several significant employer customers or payor contracts, its results may be adversely affected.\nConcentra\u2019s results may decline if it loses several significant employer customers or payor contracts. One or more of Concentra\u2019s significant employer customers could be acquired. Additionally, Concentra could lose significant employer customers or payor contracts due to competitive pricing pressures or other reasons. The loss of several significant employer customers or payor contracts could cause a material decline in Concentra\u2019s profitability and operating performance.\nIf there are changes in the rates or methods of Medicare reimbursements for our services, our revenue and profitability could decline.\nApproximately 26% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019, 25% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, and 23% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021, came from the highly regulated federal Medicare program.\nIn recent years, through legislative and regulatory actions, the federal government has made substantial changes to various payment systems under the Medicare program. President Obama signed into law comprehensive reforms to the healthcare system, including changes to the methods for, and amounts of, Medicare reimbursement. Additional reforms or other changes to these payment systems, including modifications to the conditions on qualification for payment, bundling payments to cover both acute and post-acute care, or the imposition of enrollment limitations on new providers, may be proposed or could be adopted, either by Congress or CMS.\nIf revised regulations are adopted, the availability, methods, and rates of Medicare reimbursements for services of the type furnished at our facilities could change. Reductions in Medicare reimbursements could also adversely affect payments under some of our commercial payor contracts that follow Medicare payment methodologies. For example, the rules and regulations related to patient criteria for our critical illness recovery hospitals could become more stringent and reduce the number of patients we admit. Some of these changes and proposed changes could adversely affect our business strategy, operations, and financial results. In addition, there can be no assurance that any increases in Medicare reimbursement rates established by CMS will fully reflect increases in our operating costs.\nWe conduct business in a heavily regulated industry, and changes in regulations, new interpretations of existing regulations, or violations of regulations may result in increased costs or sanctions that reduce our revenue and profitability.\nThe healthcare industry is subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to: (i) facility and professional licensure, including certificates of need; (ii) conduct of operations, including financial relationships among healthcare providers, Medicare fraud and abuse, and physician self-referral; (iii) addition of facilities and services and enrollment of newly developed facilities in the Medicare program; (iv) payment for services; and (v) safeguarding protected health information.\nBoth federal and state regulatory agencies inspect, survey, and audit our facilities to review our compliance with these laws and regulations. While our facilities intend to comply with existing licensing, Medicare certification requirements, and accreditation standards, there can be no assurance that these regulatory authorities will determine that all applicable requirements are fully met at any given time. A determination by any of these regulatory authorities that a facility is not in compliance with these requirements could lead to the imposition of requirements that the facility takes corrective action, assessment of fines and penalties, or loss of licensure, Medicare certification, or accreditation. These consequences could have an adverse effect on our company.\nIn addition, there have been heightened coordinated civil and criminal enforcement efforts by both federal and state government agencies relating to the healthcare industry. The ongoing investigations relate to, among other things, various referral practices, billing practices, and physician ownership. In the future, different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject us to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel, services, and capital expenditure programs. These changes may increase our operating expenses and reduce our operating revenues. If we fail to comply with these extensive laws and government regulations, we could become ineligible to receive government program reimbursement, suffer civil or criminal penalties, or be required to make significant changes to our operations. In addition, we could be forced to expend considerable resources responding to any related investigation or other enforcement action.\nIf our critical illness recovery hospitals fail to maintain their certifications as LTCHs or if our facilities operated as HIHs fail to qualify as hospitals separate from their host hospitals, our revenue and profitability may decline.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we operated 104 critical illness recovery hospitals, all of which are currently certified by Medicare as LTCHs. LTCHs must meet certain conditions of participation to enroll in, and seek payment from, the Medicare program as an LTCH, including, among other things, maintaining an average length of stay for Medicare patients in excess of 25 days. An LTCH that fails to maintain this average length of stay for Medicare patients in excess of 25 days during a single cost reporting period is generally allowed an opportunity to show that it meets the length of stay criteria during a subsequent cure period. If the LTCH can show that it meets the length of stay criteria during this cure period, it will continue to be paid under the LTCH-PPS. If the LTCH again fails to meet the average length of stay criteria during the cure period, it will be paid under the general acute care IPPS at rates generally lower than the rates under the LTCH-PPS.\nWhile CMS has issued temporary waivers that exempt LTCHs from the 25 day average length of stay requirement for all cost reporting periods that include the COVID-19 pandemic health emergency, to the extent such waivers are lifted, LTCHs will again be required to comply with this rule. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Regulatory Changes.\u201d\nSimilarly, our HIHs must meet conditions of participation in the Medicare program, which include additional criteria establishing separateness from the hospital with which the HIH shares space. If our critical illness recovery hospitals fail to meet or maintain the standards for certification as LTCHs, they will receive payment under the general acute care hospitals IPPS which is generally lower than payment under the system applicable to LTCHs. Payments at rates applicable to general acute care hospitals would result in our hospitals receiving significantly less Medicare reimbursement than they currently receive for their patient services.\nDecreases in Medicare reimbursement rates received by our outpatient rehabilitation clinics may reduce our future revenue and profitability.\nOur outpatient rehabilitation clinics receive payments from the Medicare program under the Medicare physician fee schedule. In the calendar year 2022 physician fee schedule final rule, CMS announced that Medicare payments for the therapy specialty are expected to decrease 1% in 2022. After CMS issued the final rule, Congress passed the Protecting Medicare and American Farmers from Sequester Cuts Act, which provided in Section 3 a one-time 3% increase in payments in calendar year 2022 to offset most of the 3.75% cut to payments for therapy services and other services paid under the physician fee schedule that otherwise would have occurred in calendar year 2022.\nIn addition, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 requires that payments under the physician fee schedule be adjusted starting in 2019 based on performance in a MIPS and additional incentives for participation in APMs. The specifics of the MIPS and incentives for participation in APMs will be subject to future notice and comment rule-making. In 2019, CMS added physical and occupational therapists to the list of MIPS eligible clinicians. For these therapists in private practice, payments under the fee schedule are subject to adjustment in a later year based on their performance in MIPS according to established performance standards. Calendar year 2021 is the first year that payments are adjusted, based upon the therapist\u2019s performance under MIPS in 2019. Each year from 2019 through 2024 eligible clinicians who receive a significant share of their revenues through an advanced APM (such as accountable care organizations or bundled payment arrangements) that involves risk of financial losses and a quality measurement component will receive a 5% bonus. The bonus payment for APM participation is intended to encourage participation and testing of new APMs and to promote the alignment of incentives across payors. Providers in facility-based outpatient therapy settings are excluded from MIPS eligibility and therefore not subject to this payment adjustment. It is unclear what impact, if any, the MIPS and incentives for participation in alternative payment models will have on our business and operating results, but any resulting administrative burden or decrease in payment may reduce our future revenue and profitability.\nIn the calendar year 2022 physician fee schedule final rule, CMS also adopted its plan to transition the MIPS program to MVPs. CMS will begin the transition to MVPs in 2023 with an initial set of MVPs in which reporting is voluntary. Beginning in 2026, multispecialty groups must form subgroups to report MVPs. CMS plans to develop more MVPs from 2024 to 2027 and is considering that MVP reporting would become mandatory in 2028. Each MVP would include population health claims-based measures and require clinicians to report on the Promoting Interoperability performance category measures. In addition, MVP participants would select certain quality measures and improvement activities and then report data for such measures and activities. At this time, it is unclear the impact that the transition to MVPs will have on our business and operating results, however, any resulting administrative burden or decrease in reimbursement rates may reduce our future revenue and profitability.\nThe nature of the markets that Concentra serves may constrain its ability to raise prices at rates sufficient to keep pace with the inflation of its costs.\nRates of reimbursement for work-related injury or illness visits in Concentra\u2019s occupational health services business are established through a legislative or regulatory process within each state that Concentra serves. Currently, 36 states in which Concentra has operations have fee schedules pursuant to which all healthcare providers are uniformly reimbursed. The fee schedules are determined by each state and generally prescribe the maximum amounts that may be reimbursed for a designated procedure. In the states without fee schedules, healthcare providers are generally reimbursed based on usual, customary and reasonable rates charged in the particular state in which the services are provided. Given that Concentra does not control these processes, it may be subject to financial risks if individual jurisdictions reduce rates or do not routinely raise rates of reimbursement in a manner that keeps pace with the inflation of Concentra\u2019s costs of service.\nIf our rehabilitation hospitals fail to comply with the 60% Rule or admissions to IRFs are limited due to changes to the diagnosis codes on the presumptive compliance list, our revenue and profitability may decline.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we operated 30 rehabilitation hospitals, all of which were certified as Medicare providers and operating as IRFs. Our rehabilitation hospitals must meet certain conditions of participation to enroll in, and seek payment from, the Medicare program as an IRF. Among other things, at least 60% of the IRF\u2019s total inpatient population must require treatment for one or more of 13 conditions specified by regulation. This requirement is now commonly referred to as the \u201c60% Rule.\u201d Compliance with the 60% Rule is demonstrated through a two-step process. The first step is the \u201cpresumptive\u201d method, in which patient diagnosis codes are compared to a \u201cpresumptive compliance\u201d list. IRFs that fail to demonstrate compliance with the 60% Rule using this presumptive test may demonstrate compliance through a second step involving an audit of the facility\u2019s medical records to assess compliance.\nIf an IRF does not demonstrate compliance with the 60% Rule by either the presumptive method or through a review of medical records, then the facility\u2019s classification as an IRF may be terminated at the start of its next cost reporting period causing the facility to be paid as a general acute care hospital under IPPS. If our rehabilitation hospitals fail to demonstrate compliance with the 60% Rule through both methods and are classified as general acute care hospitals, our revenue and profitability may be adversely affected.\nCMS has issued temporary waivers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that allow IRFs, IRF units and hospitals and units applying to be classified as IRFs to exclude patients admitted solely to respond to the public health emergency from the 60% Rule. If such waivers are lifted, our IRFs will again be required to comply with the requirements of the 60% Rule. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Regulatory Changes.\u201d\nAs a result of post-payment reviews of claims we submit to Medicare for our services, we may incur additional costs and may be required to repay amounts already paid to us.\nWe are subject to regular post-payment inquiries, investigations, and audits of the claims we submit to Medicare for payment for our services. These post-payment reviews include medical necessity reviews for Medicare patients admitted to LTCHs and IRFs, and audits of Medicare claims under the Recovery Audit Contractor program. These post-payment reviews may require us to incur additional costs to respond to requests for records and to pursue the reversal of payment denials, and ultimately may require us to refund amounts paid to us by Medicare that are determined to have been overpaid.\nMost of our critical illness recovery hospitals are subject to short-term leases, and the loss of multiple leases close in time could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe lease most of our critical illness recovery hospitals under short-term leases with terms of less than ten years. These leases often do not have favorable renewal options and generally cannot be renewed or extended without the written consent of the landlords thereunder. If we cannot renew or extend a significant number of our existing leases, or if the terms for lease renewal or extension offered by landlords on a significant number of leases are unacceptable to us, then the loss of multiple leases close in time could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur facilities are subject to extensive federal and state laws and regulations relating to the privacy of individually identifiable information.\nHIPAA required the United States Department of Health and Human Services to adopt standards to protect the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information. The department released final regulations containing privacy standards in December 2000 and published revisions to the final regulations in August 2002. The privacy regulations extensively regulate the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information. The regulations also provide patients with significant new rights related to understanding and controlling how their health information is used or disclosed. The security regulations require healthcare providers to implement administrative, physical and technical practices to protect the security of individually identifiable health information that is maintained or transmitted electronically. HITECH, which was signed into law in February 2009, enhanced the privacy, security, and enforcement provisions of HIPAA by, among other things, establishing security breach notification requirements, allowing enforcement of HIPAA by state attorneys general, and increasing penalties for HIPAA violations. Violations of HIPAA or HITECH could result in civil or criminal penalties. For example, HITECH permits HHS to conduct audits of HIPAA compliance and impose penalties even if we did not know or reasonably could not have known about the violation and increases civil monetary penalty amounts up to $50,000 per violation with a maximum of $1.5 million in a calendar year for violations of the same requirement.\nIn addition to HIPAA, there are numerous federal and state laws and regulations addressing patient and consumer privacy concerns, including unauthorized access, or theft of patient\u2019s identifiable health information. State statutes and regulations vary from state to state. Lawsuits, including class actions and action by state attorneys general, directed at companies that have experienced a privacy or security breach also can occur.\nIn the conduct of our business, we process, maintain, and transmit sensitive data, including our patient\u2019s individually identifiable health information. We have developed a comprehensive set of policies and procedures in our efforts to comply with HIPAA and other privacy laws. Our compliance officer, privacy officer, and information security officer are responsible for implementing and monitoring compliance with our privacy and security policies and procedures at our facilities. We believe that the cost of our compliance with HIPAA and other federal and state privacy laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. However, there can be no assurance that a breach of privacy or security will not occur. If there is a breach, we may be subject to various lawsuits, penalties and damages and may be required to incur costs to mitigate the impact of the breach on affected individuals.\nWe may be adversely affected by a security breach of our, or our third-party vendors\u2019, information technology systems, such as a cyber attack, which may cause a violation of HIPAA or HITECH and subject us to potential legal and reputational harm.\nIn the normal course of business, our information technology systems hold sensitive patient information including patient demographic data, eligibility for various medical plans including Medicare and Medicaid, and protected health information, which is subject to HIPAA and HITECH. Additionally, we utilize those same systems to perform our day-to-day activities, such as receiving referrals, assigning medical teams to patients, documenting medical information, maintaining an accurate record of all transactions, processing payments, and maintaining our employee\u2019s personal information. We also contract with third-party vendors to maintain and store our patient\u2019s individually identifiable health information. Numerous state and federal laws and regulations address privacy and information security concerns resulting from our access to our patients\u2019 and employees\u2019 personal information.\nOur information technology systems and those of our vendors that process, maintain, and transmit such data are subject to computer viruses, cyber attacks, or breaches. We adhere to policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with HIPAA and other privacy and information security laws and require our third-party vendors to do so as well. Failure to maintain the security and functionality of our information systems and related software, or to defend a cybersecurity attack or other attempt to gain unauthorized access to our or third-party\u2019s systems, facilities, or patient health information could expose us to a number of adverse consequences, including but not limited to disruptions in our operations, regulatory and other civil and criminal penalties, reputational harm, investigations and enforcement actions (including, but not limited to, those arising from the SEC, Federal Trade Commission, the OIG or state attorneys general), fines, litigation with those affected by the data breach, loss of customers, disputes with payors, and increased operating expense, which either individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. Although we maintain cyber liability insurance to protect us from losses related to cyber attacks and breaches, not every risk or liability can be insured, and for risks that are insurable, our policy limits and terms of coverage may not be sufficient to cover all actual losses or liabilities incurred.\nFurthermore, while our information technology systems, and those of our third-party vendors, are maintained with safeguards protecting against cyber attacks, including passive intrusion protection, firewalls, and virus detection software, these safeguards do not ensure that a significant cyber attack could not occur. A cyber attack that bypasses our information technology security systems, or those of our third-party vendors, could cause the loss of protected health information, or other data subject to privacy laws, the loss of proprietary business information, or a material disruption to our or a third-party vendor\u2019s information technology business systems resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. In addition, our future results could be adversely affected due to the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of protected health information, other confidential data or proprietary business information, operational or business delays resulting from the disruption of information technology systems and subsequent clean-up and mitigation activities, negative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage with clients, members, or industry peers, or regulatory action taken as a result of such incident. We provide our employees annual training and regular reminders on important measures they can take to prevent breaches and other cyber threats. We routinely identify attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems. However, given the rapidly evolving nature and proliferation of cyber threats, there can be no assurance our training and network security measures or other controls will detect, prevent, or remediate security or data breaches in a timely manner or otherwise prevent unauthorized access to, damage to, or interruption of our systems and operations. For example, it has been widely reported that many well-organized international interests, in certain cases with the backing of sovereign governments, are targeting the theft of patient information through the use of advance persistent threats. Similarly, in recent years, several hospitals have reported being the victim of ransomware attacks in which they lost access to their systems, including clinical systems, during the course of the attacks. While we are not aware of having experienced a material cyber breach or attack to date, we are likely to face attempted attacks in the future. Accordingly, we may be vulnerable to losses associated with the improper functioning, security breach, or unavailability of our information systems as well as any systems used in acquired operations.\nOur acquisitions require transitions and integration of various information technology systems, and we regularly upgrade and expand our information technology systems\u2019 capabilities. If we experience difficulties with the transition and integration of these systems or are unable to implement, maintain, or expand our systems properly, we could suffer from, among other things, operational disruptions, regulatory problems, working capital disruptions, and increases in administrative expenses. While we make significant efforts to address any information security issues and vulnerabilities with respect to the companies we acquire, we may still inherit risks of security breaches or other compromises when we integrate these companies within our business.\nQuality reporting requirements may negatively impact Medicare reimbursement.\nThe IMPACT Act requires the submission of standardized data by certain healthcare providers. Specifically, the IMPACT Act requires, among other significant activities, that LTCHs, IRFs, SNFs, and HHAs report standardized patient assessment data to CMS for cross-setting quality measures, resource use measures, and standardized patient assessment data elements. To the extent that such reporting requirements have been incorporated into the Medicare quality reporting programs, failure to report such data as required will subject providers to a 2% reduction to their annual payment update for the fiscal year that follows the reporting period. As CMS adds new measures to the Medicare quality reporting programs to implement the IMPACT Act, the burden to report data increases. It is expected that when CMS adopts all of the new measures associated with the IMPACT Act, provider reporting obligations will be quite burdensome. The adoption of these and additional quality reporting measures for our hospitals to track and report will require additional time and expense and could affect reimbursement in the future. In healthcare generally, the burdens associated with collecting, recording, and reporting quality data are increasing.\nThere can be no assurance that all of our hospitals will continue to meet quality reporting requirements in the future which may result in one or more of our hospitals seeing a reduction in its Medicare reimbursements. Regardless, we, like other healthcare providers, are likely to incur additional expenses in an effort to comply with additional and changing quality reporting requirements.\nCMS also adopted revised discharge planning requirements for hospitals in 2019 that focus on patients' goals and preferences and on preparing them and, as appropriate, their caregivers, to be active partners in their post-discharge care. As part of these updates to the discharge planning process, CMS began requiring that hospitals assist patients in selecting a post-acute care provider by sharing quality measure and resource use measure data from LTCHs, IRFs, SNFs, and HHAs. The collection of data for these quality and resource use measures, and the use of these data in the discharge planning process at hospitals, has the potential to affect admission patterns at our LTCHs and IRFs.\nWe may be adversely affected by negative publicity which can result in increased governmental and regulatory scrutiny and possibly adverse regulatory changes.\nNegative press coverage, including about the industries in which we currently operate, can result in increased governmental and regulatory scrutiny and possibly adverse regulatory changes. Adverse publicity and increased governmental scrutiny can have a negative impact on our reputation with referral sources and patients and on the morale and performance of our employees, both of which could adversely affect our businesses and results of operations.\nCurrent and future acquisitions may use significant resources, may be unsuccessful, and could expose us to unforeseen liabilities.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we may pursue acquisitions of critical illness recovery hospitals, rehabilitation hospitals, outpatient rehabilitation clinics, and other related healthcare facilities and services. These acquisitions, may involve significant cash expenditures, debt incurrence, additional operating losses and expenses, and compliance risks that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate our acquired businesses into ours, and therefore, we may not be able to realize the intended benefits from an acquisition. If we fail to successfully integrate acquisitions, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. These acquisitions could result in difficulties integrating acquired operations, technologies, and personnel into our business. Such difficulties may divert significant financial, operational, and managerial resources from our existing operations and make it more difficult to achieve our operating and strategic objectives. We may fail to retain employees or patients acquired through these acquisitions, which may negatively impact the integration efforts. These acquisitions could also have a negative impact on our results of operations if it is subsequently determined that goodwill or other acquired intangible assets are impaired, thus resulting in an impairment charge in a future period.\nIn addition, these acquisitions involve risks that the acquired businesses will not perform in accordance with expectations; that we may become liable for unforeseen financial or business liabilities of the acquired businesses, including liabilities for failure to comply with healthcare regulations; that the expected synergies associated with acquisitions will not be achieved; and that business judgments concerning the value, strengths, and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove incorrect, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFuture joint ventures may use significant resources, may be unsuccessful, and could expose us to unforeseen liabilities.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we have partnered and may partner with large healthcare systems to provide post-acute care services. These joint ventures have included and may involve significant cash expenditures, debt incurrence, additional operating losses and expenses, and compliance risks that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nA joint venture involves the combining of corporate cultures and mission. As a result, we may not be able to successfully operate a joint venture, and therefore, we may not be able to realize the intended benefits. If we fail to successfully execute a joint venture relationship, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. A new joint venture could result in difficulties in combining operations, technologies, and personnel. Such difficulties may divert significant financial, operational, and managerial resources from our existing operations and make it more difficult to achieve our operating and strategic objectives. We may fail to retain employees or patients as a result of the integration efforts.\nA joint venture is operated through a board of directors that contains representatives of Select and other parties to the joint venture. We may not control the board of certain joint ventures and, as a result, such joint ventures may take certain actions that could have adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to compete effectively with other hospitals, clinics, occupational health centers, and healthcare providers in the local areas we serve, our revenue and profitability may decline.\nThe healthcare business is highly competitive, and we compete with other hospitals, rehabilitation clinics, occupational health centers, and other healthcare providers for patients. If we are unable to compete effectively in the critical illness recovery, rehabilitation hospital, outpatient rehabilitation, and occupational health services businesses, our ability to retain customers and physicians, or maintain or increase our revenue growth, price flexibility, control over medical cost trends, and marketing expenses may be compromised and our revenue and profitability may decline.\nMany of our critical illness recovery hospitals and our rehabilitation hospitals operate in geographic areas where we compete with at least one other facility that provides similar services.\nOur outpatient rehabilitation clinics face competition from a variety of local and national outpatient rehabilitation providers, including physician-owned physical therapy clinics, dedicated locally owned and managed outpatient rehabilitation clinics, and hospital or university owned or affiliated ventures, as well as national and regional providers in select areas. Other competing outpatient rehabilitation clinics in local areas we serve may have greater name recognition and longer operating histories than our clinics. The managers of these competing clinics may also have stronger relationships with physicians in their communities, which could give them a competitive advantage for patient referrals. Because the barriers to entry are not substantial and current customers have the flexibility to move easily to new healthcare service providers, we believe that new outpatient physical therapy competitors can emerge relatively quickly.\nConcentra\u2019s primary competitors have typically been independent physicians, hospital emergency departments, and hospital-owned or hospital-affiliated medical facilities. Because the barriers to entry in Concentra\u2019s geographic markets are not substantial and its current customers have the flexibility to move easily to new healthcare service providers, new competitors to Concentra can emerge relatively quickly. The markets for Concentra\u2019s consumer health business are also fragmented and competitive. If Concentra\u2019s competitors are better able to attract patients or expand services at their facilities than Concentra is, Concentra may experience an overall decline in revenue.\nFuture cost containment initiatives undertaken by private third-party payors may limit our future revenue and profitability.\nInitiatives undertaken by major insurers and managed care companies to contain healthcare costs affect our profitability. These payors attempt to control healthcare costs by contracting with hospitals and other healthcare providers to obtain services on a discounted basis. We believe that this trend may continue and may limit reimbursements for healthcare services. If insurers or managed care companies from whom we receive substantial payments reduce the amounts they pay for services, our profit margins may decline, or we may lose patients if we choose not to renew our contracts with these insurers at lower rates.\nIf we fail to maintain established relationships with the physicians in the areas we serve, our revenue may decrease.\nOur success is partially dependent upon the admissions and referral practices of the physicians in the communities our critical illness recovery hospitals, rehabilitation hospitals, and outpatient rehabilitation clinics serve, and our ability to maintain good relations with these physicians. Physicians referring patients to our hospitals and clinics are generally not our employees and, in many of the local areas that we serve, most physicians have admitting privileges at other hospitals and are free to refer their patients to other providers. If we are unable to successfully cultivate and maintain strong relationships with these physicians, our hospitals\u2019 admissions and our facilities\u2019 and clinics\u2019 businesses may decrease, and our revenue may decline.\nOur business operations could be significantly disrupted if we lose key members of our management team.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our senior officers and other key employees, and our ability to retain and motivate these individuals. We currently have employment agreements in place with three executive officers and change in control agreements and/or non-competition agreements with several other officers. Many of these individuals also have significant equity ownership in our company. We do not maintain any key life insurance policies for any of our employees. The loss of the services of certain of these individuals could disrupt significant aspects of our business, could prevent us from successfully executing our business strategy, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn conducting our business, we are required to comply with applicable laws regarding fee-splitting and the corporate practice of medicine.\nSome states prohibit the \u201ccorporate practice of medicine\u201d that restricts business corporations from practicing medicine through the direct employment of physicians or from exercising control over medical decisions by physicians. Some states similarly prohibit the \u201ccorporate practice of therapy.\u201d The laws relating to corporate practice vary from state to state and are not fully developed in each state in which we have facilities. Typically, however, professional corporations owned and controlled by licensed professionals are exempt from corporate practice restrictions and may employ physicians or therapists to furnish professional services. Also, in some states, hospitals are permitted to employ physicians.\nSome states also prohibit entities from engaging in certain financial arrangements, such as fee-splitting, with physicians or therapists. The laws relating to fee-splitting also vary from state to state and are not fully developed. Generally, these laws restrict business arrangements that involve a physician or therapist sharing medical fees with a referral source, but in some states, these laws have been interpreted to extend to management agreements between physicians or therapists and business entities under some circumstances.\nWe believe that the Company\u2019s current and planned activities do not constitute fee-splitting or the unlawful corporate practice of medicine as contemplated by these state laws. However, there can be no assurance that future interpretations of such laws will not require structural and organizational modification of our existing relationships with the practices. If a court or regulatory body determines that we have violated these laws or if new laws are introduced that would render our arrangements illegal, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, our contracts could be found legally invalid and unenforceable (in whole or in part), or we could be required to restructure our contractual arrangements with our affiliated physicians and other licensed providers.\nSignificant legal actions could subject us to substantial uninsured liabilities.\nPhysicians, hospitals, and other healthcare providers have become subject to an increasing number of legal actions alleging malpractice, product liability, or related legal theories. Many of these actions involve large claims and significant defense costs. We are also subject to lawsuits under federal and state whistleblower statutes designed to combat fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These whistleblower lawsuits are not covered by insurance and can involve significant monetary damages and award bounties to private plaintiffs who successfully bring the suits. See \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d and Note 21 - Commitments and Contingencies in our audited consolidated financial statements.\nWe currently maintain professional malpractice liability insurance and general liability insurance coverages through a number of different programs that are dependent upon such factors as the state where we are operating and whether the operations are wholly owned or are operated through a joint venture. For our wholly owned operations, we currently maintain insurance coverages under a combination of policies with a total annual aggregate limit of up to $37.0 million for professional malpractice liability insurance and $40.0 million for general liability insurance. Our insurance for the professional liability coverage is written on a \u201cclaims-made\u201d basis, and our commercial general liability coverage is maintained on an \u201coccurrence\u201d basis. These coverages apply after a self-insured retention limit is exceeded. For our joint venture operations, we have designed a separate insurance program that responds to the risks of specific joint ventures. Most of our joint ventures are insured under a master program with an annual aggregate limit of up to $80.0 million, subject to a sublimit aggregate ranging from $23.0 million to $33.0 million for most joint ventures. The policies are generally written on a \u201cclaims-made\u201d basis. Each of these programs has either a deductible or self-insured retention limit. We also maintain additional types of liability insurance covering claims which, due to their nature or amount, are not covered by or not fully covered by our professional and general liability insurance policies. Our insurance policies also do not generally cover punitive damages and are subject to various deductibles and policy limits. We review our insurance program annually and may make adjustments to the amount of insurance coverage and self-insured retentions in future years. See \u201cBusiness-Government Regulations-Other Healthcare Regulations.\u201d\nConcentration of ownership among our existing executives and directors may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions.\nOur executives and directors, beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 18.0% of Holdings\u2019 outstanding common stock as of February 1, 2022. As a result, these stockholders have significant control over our management and policies and are able to exercise influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, amendment of our certificate of incorporation, and approval of significant corporate transactions. The directors elected by these stockholders are able to make decisions affecting our capital structure, including decisions to issue additional capital stock, implement stock repurchase programs, and incur indebtedness. This influence may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers, delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in management, or limiting the ability of our other stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interest.\nRisks Related to Our Capital Structure\nOur substantial indebtedness may limit the amount of cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our business.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $3,574.0 million of total indebtedness. Our indebtedness could have important consequences to you. For example, it:\n\u2022requires us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, development activity, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022increases our vulnerability to adverse general economic or industry conditions;\n\u2022limits our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or the industries in which we operate;\n\u2022makes us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates, as borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities are at variable rates, subject to our interest swap agreement;\n\u2022limits our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital or other purposes; and\n\u2022places us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness.\nAny of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects, and ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness. In addition, there would be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows if we were unable to service our indebtedness or obtain additional financing, as needed.\nSee \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nOur credit facilities and the indenture governing our 6.250% senior notes require us to comply with certain covenants and obligations, the default of which may result in the acceleration of certain of our indebtedness.\nIn the case of an event of default under the agreements governing our credit facilities or our Indenture (as defined below), the lenders or noteholders under such agreements could elect to declare all amounts borrowed, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, to be due and payable. If we are unable to obtain a waiver from the requisite lenders or noteholders under such circumstances, these lenders or noteholders could exercise their rights, then our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, and we could become bankrupt or insolvent.\nOur credit agreement contains several covenants such as limitations on mergers, consolidations and dissolutions; sales of assets; investments and acquisitions; indebtedness; liens; affiliate transactions; and dividends and restricted payments. Our credit facilities also require us to maintain a leverage ratio (based upon the ratio of indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA as defined in the agreements governing our credit facilities), which is tested quarterly. Failure to comply with any of these covenants would result in an event of default under our credit facilities.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we were required to maintain our leverage ratio (the ratio of total indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA for the prior four consecutive fiscal quarters) at less than 7.00 to 1.00. At December 31, 2021, our leverage ratio was 3.77 to 1.00.\nOur indenture, dated August 1, 2019, by and among Select, the guarantors named therein and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the \u201cIndenture\u201d), contains covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries, which unconditionally guarantee on a joint and several basis the senior notes under the Indenture, to (i) grant liens on its assets, (ii) make dividend payments, other distributions or other restricted payments, (iii) incur restrictions on the ability of Select\u2019s restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments, (iv) enter into sale and leaseback transactions, (v) merge, consolidate, transfer or dispose of substantially all of their assets, (vi) incur additional indebtedness, (vii) make investments, (viii) sell assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries, (ix) use the proceeds from sales of assets, including capital stock of restricted subsidiaries, and (x) enter into transactions with affiliates. In addition, the Indenture requires us, among other things, to provide financial and current reports to holders of the notes or file such reports electronically with the SEC.\nOur inability to comply with any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit facilities or our Indenture. In the event of any default under the credit facilities, the revolving lenders could elect to terminate borrowing commitments and declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. In the event of any default under our Indenture, the trustee or holders of 25% of the 6.250% senior notes could declare all outstanding notes immediately due and payable. A breach of a covenant under our credit agreement or Indenture could result in a default under that debt instrument and, due to cross-default provisions, could result in a default under the other debt instrument. A default under our credit facilities or our indenture could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects, and may even lead to bankruptcy or insolvency.\nPayment of interest on, and repayment of principal of, our indebtedness is dependent in part on cash flow generated by our subsidiaries.\nPayment of interest on, and repayment of, principal of our indebtedness will be dependent in part upon cash flow generated by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment, or otherwise. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. In the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness. In addition, any payment of interest, dividends, distributions, loans, or advances by our subsidiaries to us could be subject to restrictions on dividends or repatriation of distributions under applicable local law, monetary transfer restrictions, and foreign currency exchange regulations in the jurisdictions in which the subsidiaries operate or under arrangements with local partners. Furthermore, the ability of our subsidiaries to make such payments of interest, dividends, distributions, loans, or advances may be contested by taxing authorities in the relevant jurisdictions.\nDespite our substantial level of indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur additional indebtedness. This could further exacerbate the risks described above.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future. Although our credit facilities and the Indenture contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Also, these restrictions do not prevent us or our subsidiaries from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. As of December 31, 2021, we had $434.7 million of availability under our revolving facility (as defined below) (after giving effect to $160.0 million of outstanding borrowings and $55.3 million of outstanding letters of credit). In addition, to the extent new debt is added to us and our subsidiaries\u2019 current debt levels, the substantial leverage risks described above would increase.\nChanges in the method of determining London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect interest expense related to our debt.\nAmounts drawn under our credit facilities bear interest rates at the election of the borrower, in relation to LIBOR or an alternate base rate. On March 5, 2021, the Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d) in the U.K. announced that all LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided or no longer be representative (i) immediately after December 31, 2021, in the case of the one-week and two-month USD LIBOR terms and all sterling, euro, Swiss franc and Japanese yen settings, and (ii) immediately after June 30, 2023, in the case of the one-, three-, six-, and 12-month USD LIBOR terms. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist. The U.S. Federal Reserve is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a newly created index called the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, calculated with a broad set of short-term repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities. Our credit facilities contain certain provisions concerning the possibility that LIBOR may cease to exist, and that an alternative reference rate may be chosen. However, if LIBOR in fact ceases to exist, and no rate is acceptable to Select or JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as agent to our credit agreement, amounts drawn under our credit facilities would be subject to the alternate base rate, which may be a higher interest rate than LIBOR which would increase our interest expense. As a result, we may need to renegotiate our credit facilities and may not be able to do so with terms that are favorable to us. The overall financial market may be disrupted as a result of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR. Disruption in the financial market or the inability to renegotiate the credit facilities with favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results.\nAt December 31, 2021, we had $2,103.4 million of term loan borrowings outstanding. These borrowings bore interest at a rate that is indexed to one-month LIBOR plus 2.25% during the year ended December 31, 2021. Assuming these borrowings bore interest at a rate equal to the 4.50%, the Alternate Base Rate in effect at December 31, 2021, during the year ended December 31, 2021, we would have experienced an increase in interest expense of $45.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nWe may be unable to refinance our debt on terms favorable to us or at all, which would negatively impact our business and financial condition.\nWe are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest. While we intend to refinance all of our indebtedness before it matures, there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any maturing indebtedness, that such refinancing will be on terms as favorable to us as the terms of the maturing indebtedness or, if the indebtedness cannot be refinanced, that we will be able to otherwise obtain funds by selling assets or raising equity to make required payments on our maturing indebtedness. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness at or before maturity or otherwise meet our payment obligations, our business and financial condition will be negatively impacted, and we may be in default under our indebtedness. Any default under our credit facilities would permit lenders to foreclose on our assets and would also be deemed a default under the Indenture governing our 6.250% senior notes, which may also result in the acceleration of that indebtedness,.\nSee \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d", "PERMNO": 93035, "SIC": 8060, "TIC": "SEM"}
