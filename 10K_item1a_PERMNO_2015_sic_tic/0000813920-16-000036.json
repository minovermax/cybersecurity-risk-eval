{"cik": "813920", "company": "CEC ENTERTAINMENT INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-02", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur business operations and the implementation of our business strategy are subject to significant risks inherent in our business, including, without limitation, the risks and uncertainties described below. The occurrence of any one or more of the risks or uncertainties described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Because these forward-looking statements are based on estimates and assumptions that are subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control or are subject to change, actual results could be materially different.\nIf we are unable to successfully open new stores or appropriately update and evolve our current store base, our business and our consolidated financial results could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to increase revenues and improve financial results depends, to a significant degree, on our ability to successfully implement and refine our long-term growth strategy. As part of our long-term growth strategy, we plan to upgrade the games, rides and entertainment in some of our existing stores, remodel and expand certain of our existing stores and open additional new stores in selected markets. The opening and success of new Chuck E. Cheese\u2019s and Peter Piper Pizza stores is dependent on various factors, including but not limited to the availability of suitable sites, the negotiation of acceptable lease terms for such locations, our ability to meet construction schedules, our ability to manage such expansion and hire and train personnel to manage the new stores, the potential cannibalization of sales at our adjacent stores located in the market, as well as general economic and business conditions. Our ability to successfully open new stores or remodel, expand or upgrade the entertainment at existing stores will also depend upon the availability of sufficient capital for such purposes, including operating cash flow, our existing credit facility, future debt financings, future equity offerings, or a combination thereof. There can also be no assurance that we will be successful in opening and operating the number of anticipated new stores on a timely or profitable basis. There can be no assurance that we can continue to successfully remodel or expand our existing facilities or upgrade the games and entertainment or obtain a reasonable return on such investments.\nOur growth is also dependent on our ability to continually evolve and update our business model to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences and competitive conditions. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully anticipate changes in competitive conditions or customer preferences or that the market will accept our business model. If revenues and/or operating results are lower than our current estimates, we may incur additional charges for asset impairments in the future, which could adversely impact our consolidated financial results. Additionally, we incur significant costs each time we open a new store and other expenses when we relocate or remodel existing stores. The expenses of opening, relocating, or remodeling any of our stores may be higher than anticipated. If we are unable to open or are delayed in opening new or relocated stores, we may incur significant costs, which could adversely affect our consolidated financial results. If we are unable to remodel or are delayed in remodeling stores, we may incur significant costs, which could adversely affect our business and our consolidated financial results.\nIf we are unable to successfully open new stores or appropriately update and evolve our current store base, our business and our consolidated financial results could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to increase revenues and improve financial results depends, to a significant degree, on our ability to successfully implement and refine our long-term growth strategy.

If we are unable to remodel or are delayed in remodeling stores, we may incur significant costs, which could adversely affect our business and our consolidated financial results.\nWe may not be successful in the implementation of our marketing strategy, which could adversely affect our business and our consolidated financial results.\nOur long-term growth is dependent on the success of strategic initiatives to effectively market and advertise our concept to our target audience. In recent years, we have made significant changes to our marketing and advertising strategy, including (a) the introduction of an updated Chuck E. Cheese character; (b) change in the mix of our media expenditures; (c) an increase in advertising directed to parents; and (d) promoting our brand and reasons to visit through free-standing inserts in newspapers, on television, and online. There can be no assurance that these changes to our traditional media strategy, which was heavily weighted towards kids\u2019 television advertising, free-standing inserts in newspapers, and significant couponing, will be effective at reaching customers or be accepted by customers. If we are not effective in reaching our target audience with our new marketing and advertising strategy or if these changes are not accepted by guests, we may incur additional advertising costs, and our business and our consolidated financial results could be adversely affected.\nThe restaurant and entertainment industries are highly competitive, and that competition could harm our business and our consolidated financial results.\nWe believe that our combined restaurant and entertainment center concept puts us in a niche, which combines elements of both the restaurant and entertainment industries. As a result, we compete with entities in both industries. The family dining industry and the entertainment industry are highly competitive, with a number of major national and regional chains operating in each of these spaces. Although other restaurant chains presently utilize the concept of combined family dining-entertainment operations, we believe these competitors operate primarily on a local, regional or market-by-market basis. Within the traditional restaurant sector, we compete with other casual dining restaurants on a nationwide basis with respect to price, quality, and speed of service; type and quality of food; personnel; the number and location of restaurants; attractiveness of facilities; effectiveness of advertising; and marketing programs and new product development. To a lesser extent, our competition also includes quick service restaurants with respect to pricing, service, experience, and perceived value. Within the entertainment sector, we compete with movie theaters, bowling alleys, theme parks, and other family-oriented concepts on a nationwide basis with respect to perceived value and overall experience. Additionally, children\u2019s interests and opportunities for entertainment continue to expand. If we are unable to successfully evolve our concept, including new food and entertainment offerings, we may lose market share to our competition. These competitive market conditions, including the emergence of significant new competition, could adversely affect our business and our consolidated financial results.\nWe may not be successful in the implementation of our marketing strategy, which could adversely affect our business and our consolidated financial results.\nOur long-term growth is dependent on the success of strategic initiatives to effectively market and advertise our concept to our target audience.

If we are unable to successfully evolve our concept, including new food and entertainment offerings, we may lose market share to our competition. These competitive market conditions, including the emergence of significant new competition, could adversely affect our business and our consolidated financial results.\nEconomic uncertainty and changes in consumer discretionary spending in the U.S. and Canada could reduce sales at our stores and have an adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial results.\nPurchases at our stores are discretionary for consumers; therefore, our consolidated results of operations are susceptible to economic slowdowns and recessions. We are dependent in particular upon discretionary spending by consumers living in the communities in which our stores are located. A significant portion of our stores are clustered in certain geographic areas. Currently, a total of 179 Chuck E. Cheese\u2019s stores are located in California, Texas, and Florida (176 are Company-owned and three are franchised locations), and a total of 134 Peter Piper Pizza stores are located in Arizona, Texas, and Mexico (30 are Company-owned and 104 are franchised locations). A significant weakening in the local economies of these geographic areas, or any of the areas in which our stores are located, may cause consumers to curtail discretionary spending, which in turn could reduce our Company store sales and have an adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial results.\nThe future performance of the U.S. and global economies are uncertain and are directly affected by numerous national and global financial, political and other factors that are beyond our control. Our target market of families with young children can be highly sensitive to adverse economic conditions, which may impact their desire to spend discretionary dollars, resulting in lower customer traffic levels in our stores. Increases in credit card debt, home mortgage and other borrowing costs and declines in housing values could further weaken the U.S. or Canadian economies, leading to a further decrease in discretionary consumer spending. In addition, reduced consumer confidence as a result of a renewed recession, job losses, home foreclosures, investment losses in the financial markets, personal bankruptcies, and reduced access to credit may also result in lower levels of traffic to our stores. Moreover, our customer traffic may be impacted by major changes in U.S. fiscal policy. We believe that consumers generally are more willing to make discretionary purchases, including at our stores, during periods in which favorable economic conditions prevail. Further, fluctuations in the retail price of gasoline and the potential for future increases in gasoline and other energy costs may affect consumers\u2019 disposable incomes available for entertainment and dining. Changes in consumer spending habits as a result of a recession or a reduction in consumer confidence are likely to reduce our customer traffic and sales performance, which could have an adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial results. In addition, these economic factors could affect our level of spending on planned capital initiatives at our stores, and thereby impact our future sales, and could also result in potential asset impairments and store closures.\nNegative publicity concerning food quality, health, general safety or other issues, and changes in consumer preferences, could negatively affect our brand image and adversely affect our consolidated financial results.\nFood service businesses can be adversely affected by litigation and complaints from guests, consumer groups, or government authorities, resulting from food quality, illness, injury or other health concerns, or operating issues stemming from one store or a limited number of stores. Publicity concerning food-borne illnesses, injuries caused by food tampering, and general safety issues could negatively affect our operations, reputation and brand. Families with young children may be highly sensitive to adverse publicity that may arise from an actual or perceived negative event within one or more of our stores. We have, from time to time, received negative publicity related to altercations and other safety-related incidents in certain of our stores. There can be no assurance that in the future we will not experience negative publicity regarding one or more of our\nstores, and the existence of negative publicity could adversely affect our brand image with our customers and our consolidated financial results.\nThe speed at which negative publicity can be disseminated has increased dramatically with electronic communication, including social media. Many social media platforms allow for users to immediately publish content without checking the accuracy of the content posted. If we are unable to quickly and effectively respond to such information, we may suffer declines in guest traffic, which could adversely impact our consolidated financial results.\nIn addition, our industry is affected by consumer preferences and perceptions. Changes in prevailing health or dietary preferences and perceptions may cause consumers to avoid certain products we offer in favor of alternative or healthier foods. If consumer eating habits change significantly and we are unable to respond with appropriate menu offerings, it could adversely affect our brand image and consolidated financial results.\nOur business may also be impacted by certain public health issues including epidemics, pandemics and the rapid spread of certain illnesses and contagious diseases. To the extent that our customers feel uncomfortable visiting public locations, particularly locations with a large number of children, due to a perceived risk of exposure to a public health issue, we could experience a reduction in customer traffic, which could adversely affect our consolidated financial results.\nIncreases in food, labor, and other operating costs could adversely affect our consolidated financial results.\nThe performance of our stores is affected by changes in the costs for food products we purchase, including but not limited to cheese, dough, produce, chicken, and beef. The commodity prices for these food products vary throughout the year and may be affected by changes in supply, demand, and other factors beyond our control. We have not entered into any hedging arrangements to reduce our exposure to commodity price volatility associated with commodity prices; however, we typically enter into short-term purchasing arrangements, which may contain pricing designed to minimize the impact of commodity price fluctuations. An increase in our food costs could negatively affect our profit margins and adversely affect our consolidated financial results.\nA significant number of our store-level employees are subject to various laws concerning compensation. Several states and cities in which we operate stores have established a minimum wage higher than the federally-mandated minimum wage. There may be similar increases implemented in other jurisdictions in which we operate or seek to operate. Additionally, a number of our employees could be subject to changes in federal rules and regulations concerning increases to salary and compensation levels necessary for white collar workers to be classified as exempt in 2016 and beyond, as well as state-specific laws governing relative pay for male and female employees. Such changes in the minimum wage and other wage or salary requirements could increase our labor costs and could have an adverse effect on our profit margins and our consolidated financial results.\nThe performance of our stores could also be adversely affected by increases in the price of utilities on which the stores depend, such as electricity and natural gas, whether as a result of inflation, shortages or interruptions in supply, or otherwise. Our business also incurs significant costs for, among other things, insurance, marketing, taxes, real estate, borrowing, and litigation, all of which could increase due to inflation, rising interest rates, changes in laws, competition, or other events beyond our control, which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial results.\nOur strategy to open international franchised stores may not be successful and may subject us to unanticipated conditions in foreign markets, which could adversely impact our business and our ability to operate effectively in those markets.\nPart of our growth strategy depends on our ability to attract new international franchisees and the ability of these franchisees to open and operate new stores on a profitable basis. As we do not have a long history of significant international growth experience, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully execute this strategy in the future. Delays or failures in identifying desirable franchise partners and opening new franchised stores could adversely affect our planned growth. Moreover, our franchisees depend on the availability of financing to construct and open new stores. If these franchisees experience difficulty in obtaining adequate financing, our growth strategy and franchise revenues could be adversely affected. Additionally, our growth strategy depends on the ability of our international franchisees to learn and implement our business strategy, while adapting to the local culture. There can be no assurance that the Chuck E. Cheese\u2019s and Peter Piper Pizza concepts will be accepted in targeted international markets.\nCurrently, our international franchisees operate stores in Chile, Colombia, Guam, Guatemala, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Puerto Rico, Saudi Arabia, Trinidad & Tobago, and the United Arab Emirates. We and our franchisees are subject to the regulatory, economic, and political conditions of any foreign market in which our franchisees operate stores. Any change in the laws, regulations, and economic and political stability of these foreign markets could adversely affect our consolidated financial results. Changes in foreign markets that could affect our consolidated financial results include, but are not limited to, taxation,\ninflation, currency fluctuations, political instability, economic instability, war or conflicts, increased regulations and quotas, tariffs, and other protectionist measures. Additionally, our long-term growth strategy includes adding franchisees in additional foreign markets in the future. To the extent unfavorable conditions exist in the foreign markets we plan to expand into or we are unable to secure intellectual property rights sufficient to operate in such foreign markets, we and our international franchise partners may not be successful in opening the number of anticipated new stores on a timely and profitable basis. Delays or failures in opening new foreign market store locations could adversely affect our planned growth.\nOur business dealings with foreign franchisees and vendors are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption law, and investigations or enforcement actions brought under such law could adversely impact our business and our ability to operate effectively in those markets.\nAs a business that regularly enters into negotiations and contractual relationships with franchisees and vendors located in foreign countries, we are subject to the requirements of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other domestic and foreign laws and regulations governing such activities. Although we have a strong compliance program that includes regular training and reinforcement of our employees who represent us in dealings with foreign individuals and entities on the laws impacting such dealings, we may be faced with investigations or enforcement actions by the United States or foreign governments arising from such dealings. Responding to such investigations or enforcement actions would be costly and may divert management\u2019s attention and resources from the regular operation of our business, and together with any fines, penalties, or other actions ordered by governmental authorities, could adversely affect our business and consolidated financial results.\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital or to fund our operations, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy, and prevent us from making debt service payments.\nWe are a highly leveraged company. As of January 3, 2016, we had $1,001.8 million face value of outstanding indebtedness (excluding capital lease and sale leaseback obligations), in addition to $139.1 million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility at that date. For the Fiscal year ended January 3, 2016, we had total debt service payments of $69.8 million.\nOur substantial indebtedness could have important consequences for us, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow money for our working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, strategic initiatives or other purposes;\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions, could result in an event of default under the indenture and the agreements governing other indebtedness;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the repayment of our indebtedness, thereby reducing funds available to us for other purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our operations or business;\n\u2022\nmake us more highly leveraged than some of our competitors, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage;\n\u2022\nimpact our rent expense on leased space, which could be significant;\n\u2022\nmake us more vulnerable to downturns in our business or the economy;\n\u2022\nrestrict us from making strategic acquisitions, engaging in development activities, introducing new technologies, or exploiting business opportunities;\n\u2022\ncause us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022\nlimit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds or dispose of assets;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to repurchase shares and pay cash dividends; and\n\u2022\nexpose us to the risk of increased interest rates, as certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest.\nIn addition, our credit agreement contains restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of substantially all of our indebtedness.\nWe may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility. If new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks described above could intensify.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness that may not be successful.\nOur ability to pay principal and interest on our debt obligations will depend upon, among other things, (a) our future financial and operating performance (including the realization of any cost savings described herein), which will be affected by prevailing economic, industry and competitive conditions and financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control; and (b) our future ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility, the availability of which depends on, among other things, our complying with the covenants in the credit agreement governing such facility.\nWe cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that we will be able to draw under our revolving credit facility or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to fund our liquidity needs, including the payment of principal and interest on our debt. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to service our indebtedness, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the senior notes. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions for fair market value or at all. Furthermore, any proceeds that we could realize from any such dispositions may not be adequate to meet our debt service obligations then due. Apollo and its affiliates have no continuing obligation to provide us with debt or equity financing. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition, and could negatively impact our ability to satisfy our debt obligations.\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments on our indebtedness, we will be in default, and holders of our senior notes could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under the Secured Credit Facilities could terminate their commitments to loan money, our secured lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their loans, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under the Secured Credit Facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. Assuming the revolving credit facility remains undrawn, each 1% change in assumed interest rates, excluding the impact of our 1% interest rate floor, would result in an approximate $7.5 million increase in annual interest expense on indebtedness under the Secured Credit Facilities. In the future, we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility. However, we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk, may prove disadvantageous, or may create additional risks.\nIf we are unable to maintain and protect our information technology systems and technologies, we could suffer disruptions in our business, damage our reputation with customers, and incur substantial costs.\nThe operation of our business is heavily dependent upon the implementation, integrity, security, and successful functioning of our computer networks and information systems, including the point-of-sales systems in our stores, data centers that process transactions, the enterprise resource planning system, the birthday reservation system, and various software applications used in our operations. In the ordinary course of our business, we also collect and store on our computer networks and information systems sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees. A failure of our systems to operate effectively as a result of a cyber-attack, damage to, interruption, or failure of any of these systems could result in a failure to meet our reporting obligations, material misstatements in our Consolidated Financial Statements, or losses due to the disruption of our business operations. These adverse situations could also lead to loss of sales or profits or cause us to incur additional development costs. We purchase insurance coverage related to network security and privacy to limit the cost of any such failure or cyber-attack. However it is difficult to procure enough insurance to cover a cyber-attack. Despite\nour efforts to secure our computer networks and information systems, security could be compromised or confidential information could be misappropriated, resulting in a loss of customers\u2019 or employees\u2019 personal information, negative publicity or harm to our business and reputation that could cause us to incur costs to reimburse third parties for damages or to pay governmental fines, or cause a decrease in guest traffic.\nAny disruption of our commodity distribution system could adversely affect our business and our consolidated financial results.\nWe use a network of 15 distribution centers operated by a single company to distribute most of the products and supplies used in our Chuck E. Cheese\u2019s branded stores and one distribution center for our Peter Piper Pizza branded stores. Any failure by these distributors to adequately distribute products or supplies to our stores could increase our costs and have an adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial results. Although we believe that alternative third-party distributors are available for our products and supplies, we may incur additional costs if we are required to replace our distributors or obtain the necessary products and supplies from other suppliers, and there can be no assurance that our business would not be disrupted.\nOur procurement of games, rides, entertainment-related equipment, redemption prizes, and merchandise is dependent upon a few global providers, the loss of any of which could adversely affect our business and our consolidated financial results.\nOur ability to continue to procure new games, rides, entertainment-related equipment, redemption prizes and merchandise is important to our business strategy. The number of suppliers from which we can purchase these items is limited due to industry consolidation over the past several years. To the extent that the number of suppliers continues to decline, we could be subject to the risk of distribution delays, pricing pressure, lack of innovation, and other associated risks. Furthermore, some of our suppliers are located in China, and continuing and increasing tension between the U.S. and Chinese governments could also result in interruptions in our ability to procure these products, which could adversely affect our business and our consolidated financial results.\nWe face risks with respect to product liability claims and product recalls, which could adversely affect our reputation, business and consolidated financial results.\nWe purchase merchandise from third parties and offer this merchandise to customers in exchange for prize tickets or for sale. This merchandise could be subject to recalls and other actions by regulatory authorities. Changes in laws and regulations could also impact the type of merchandise we offer to our customers. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, issues that result in recalls of merchandise. In addition, individuals may in the future assert claims or file lawsuits, alleging that they have sustained injuries from third-party merchandise offered by us. There is a risk that these claims or liabilities may exceed, or fall outside of the scope of, our insurance coverage. Any of the issues mentioned above could result in damage to our reputation, diversion of development and management resources, or reduced sales and increased costs, any of which could adversely affect our business and our consolidated financial results.\nWe are subject to various government regulations, which could adversely affect our business and our consolidated financial results.\nThe development and operation of our stores are subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations in many areas of our business, including but not limited to those that impose restrictions, levy a fee or tax, or require a permit, license or other regulatory approval, and those that relate to the operation of redemption, video, and arcade games and rides, the preparation of food and beverages, the sale and service of alcoholic beverages, and building and zoning requirements. Difficulties or failure in obtaining required permits, licenses, or other regulatory approvals could delay or prevent the opening of a new store, remodel or expansion, and the suspension of, or inability to renew, a license or permit could interrupt operations at an existing store.\nWe are also subject to laws governing our relationship with our employees, including minimum wage requirements, exempt status, overtime, other health insurance mandates, working and safety conditions, immigration status requirements, child labor laws, and non-discrimination laws. Additionally, potential changes in federal labor laws, including card verification regulations, could result in portions of our workforce being subjected to greater organized labor influence. This could result in an increase to our labor costs. A significant portion of our store personnel are paid at rates related to the minimum wage established by federal, state and municipal law. Increases in the minimum wage result in higher labor costs, which may be only partially offset by price increases and operational efficiencies. Furthermore, we are also subject to certain laws and regulations that govern our handling of customers\u2019 personal information. A failure to protect the integrity and security of our customers\u2019 personal information could expose us to litigation, as well as materially damage our reputation.\nWe are also subject to the rules and regulations of the Federal Trade Commission and various state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises. The Federal Trade Commission and various state laws require that we furnish a franchise disclosure document containing certain information to prospective franchisees, and a number of states require registration of the franchise disclosure document with state authorities. Substantive state laws that regulate the franchisor-franchisee relationship presently exist in a substantial number of states, and bills have been introduced in Congress from time to time that would provide for federal regulation of the franchisor-franchisee relationship. The state laws often limit, among other things, the duration and scope of non-competition provisions, the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise and the ability of a franchisor to designate sources of supply. We believe that our franchise disclosure document, together with any applicable state versions or supplements, and franchising procedures, comply in all material respects with both the Federal Trade Commission guidelines and all applicable state laws regulating franchising in those states in which we have offered franchises.\nWhile we endeavor to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, governmental and regulatory bodies may change such laws and regulations in the future, which may require us to incur substantial cost increases. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we may be subject to various sanctions, penalties, and/or fines, or may be required to cease operations until we achieve compliance, which could have an adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial results.\nWe face litigation risks from customers, employees, franchisees and other third parties in the ordinary course of business, which could adversely affect our business and our consolidated financial results.\nOur business is subject to the risk of litigation by customers, current and former employees, franchisees, suppliers, stockholders, or others, through private actions, class actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions, or other litigation. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. The cost to defend future litigation may be significant. There may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could decrease customer acceptance of our food or entertainment offerings, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable. From time to time, we are also involved in lawsuits with respect to alleged infringement of third party intellectual property rights, as well as challenges to our intellectual property.\nWe are continuously subject to risks from litigation and regulatory action regarding advertising to our market of children between the ages of two and 12 years old. In addition, since certain of our stores serve alcoholic beverages, we are subject to \u201cdram shop\u201d statutes. These statutes generally allow a person injured by an intoxicated person to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated person. Although we believe we are adequately protected against such losses by insurance, a judgment against us under a \u201cdram shop\u201d statute in excess of the liability covered by insurance could have an adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial results.\nOur business may be adversely affected by local conditions, natural disasters, and other events.\nCertain regions in which our facilities (including our Support Center, stores, and warehouses) are located may be subject to adverse local conditions, natural disasters, and other events. Severe weather, such as heavy snowfall, ice, or extreme temperatures, may discourage or restrict customers in affected regions from traveling to our stores or prevent employees from performing their work in our facilities, which could adversely affect our sales. If severe weather conditions occur during the first quarter of the year, the adverse impact to our sales and profitability could be even greater than at other times during the year because we typically generate our highest sales and profits during the first quarter. Natural disasters including tornadoes, hurricanes, floods and earthquakes may damage our facilities, which may adversely affect our business and our consolidated financial results.\nOur business is seasonal, and quarterly results may fluctuate significantly as a result of this seasonality.\nWe have experienced, and in the future could experience, quarterly variations in our consolidated revenues and profitability as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside our control, including the timing of school vacations, holidays, and changing weather conditions. We typically generate our highest sales volumes and profitability in the first quarter of each fiscal year. If there is a material decrease in the customer traffic in our stores during the first quarter of the year due to unusually cold or inclement weather or other circumstances outside of our control, our operating results could be materially, adversely affected for that quarter and further, may have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial results for the fiscal year.\nPublic health issues could adversely affect our consolidated financial results.\nOur business may be impacted by certain public health issues including epidemics, pandemics and the rapid spread of certain illnesses and contagious diseases. To the extent that our customers feel uncomfortable visiting public locations, particularly locations with a large number of children, due to a perceived risk of exposure to a public health issue, we could experience a reduction in customer traffic, which could adversely affect our consolidated financial results.\nOur current insurance policies may not provide adequate levels of coverage against all claims, and we could incur losses that are not covered by our insurance, which could adversely affect our business and our consolidated financial results.\nWe have procured and maintain insurance coverage at levels that we believe are typical for a business of our type and size. However, we could experience a loss that either cannot be insured against or is not commercially reasonable to insure. For example, insurance covering liability for violations of wage and hour laws is generally not available. Under certain circumstances, plaintiffs may file certain types of claims that may not be covered by insurance. In some cases, plaintiffs may seek punitive damages, which may also not be covered by insurance. Losses such as these, if they occur, could adversely affect our business and our consolidated financial results.\nWe are dependent on the service of certain personnel, and the loss of any of these personnel could harm our business.\nOur success significantly depends on the continued employment and performance of our senior management team. We have employment agreements with certain members of our senior management team. However, we cannot prevent the members of our senior management team from terminating their employment with us. Losing the services of any member of senior management could harm our business until a suitable replacement is hired, and such replacement may not have equal experience or capabilities. Additionally, economic conditions or concerted overtures by competitors may lead to resignations of significant numbers of members of our operations management team, which may also negatively impact our consolidated financial results in the short term.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our trademarks or other proprietary rights, which could have an adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial results.\nWe own certain common law trademark rights and a number of federal and international trademark and service mark registrations, Internet domain name registrations and other proprietary rights relating to our operations. We believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights are important to our success and our competitive position. We therefore devote appropriate resources to the protection of our trademarks and proprietary rights. However, the protective actions that we take may not be enough to prevent unauthorized usage or imitation by others, which could harm our image, brand, or competitive position, and if we commence litigation to enforce our rights, we may incur significant legal fees.\nThere can be no assurance that third parties will not claim that our trademarks, menu offerings, or advertising claims infringe upon their proprietary rights or constitute unfair competition. Any such claim, whether or not it has merit, may result in costly litigation, cause delays in introducing new menu items in the future, interfere with our international development agreements, lead to delays or cancellation of pre-paid marketing campaigns, or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. As a result, any such claim could have an adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial results.\nWe are subject to risks in connection with owning and leasing real estate, which could adversely affect our consolidated financial results.\nAs an owner or lessee of the land and/or building for our Company-owned stores, we are subject to all of the risks generally associated with owning and leasing real estate, including changes in the supply and demand for real estate in general and the supply and demand for the use of the stores. We may be compelled to continue to operate a non-profitable store due to our obligations under lease agreements, or we may close a non-profitable store and continue making rental payments with respect to the lease, which could adversely affect our consolidated financial results. Furthermore, economic instability may inhibit our landlords from securing financing and maintaining good standing in their existing financing arrangements, which could result in their inability to keep existing tenants or attract new tenants, thereby reducing customer traffic to our stores. The lease terms for our leased facilities vary, and some have only a short term remaining. Most-but not all-of our leased facilities have renewal terms. When a lease term expires, the Company may not be able to renew such lease on reasonable economic and commercial terms, or at all. Such failure to renew leases on reasonable economic and commercial terms could adversely affect our business and consolidated financial results.\nWe may not be successful in integrating the operations of companies we acquire, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe have engaged in acquisition activity and we may in the future engage in acquisitions or other strategic transactions, such as investments in other entities. Strategic transactions, such as the Peter Piper Pizza acquisition completed in October 2014, involve risks, including those associated with integrating operations or maintaining operations as separate (as applicable); financial reporting; disparate technologies and personnel of acquired companies; the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns; unknown risks; and the potential loss of key employees, customers, and strategic partners of acquired companies or companies in which we may make strategic investments. We may not successfully integrate any businesses or technologies we may acquire or strategically develop in the future and may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits relating to any such strategic transactions. Strategic transactions may be expensive and time consuming, and may strain our resources. Strategic transactions may not be accretive and may negatively impact our results of operations as a result of, among other things, the incurrence of debt, write-offs of goodwill and amortization expenses of other intangible assets.\nWe are involved in litigation relating to the Merger Agreement that could divert management\u2019s attention and harm our business.\nAs described in Part I, Item 3 of this report, \u201cLegal Proceedings,\u201d in 2014 the Company and individual former members of the Company\u2019s board of directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) were named as defendants in a number of lawsuits related to the Merger Agreement and the Merger. These suits, which were subsequently consolidated into one action, generally allege, among other things, that the former directors breached their fiduciary duties owed to the Company\u2019s stockholders by, among other things, agreeing to an inadequate tender price, the adoption on January 15, 2014 of a Rights Agreement, and certain provisions in the Merger Agreement that allegedly made it less likely that the Board would consider alternative acquisition proposals. These suits also allege that The Goldman Sachs Group aided and abetted the former directors\u2019 alleged breaches of fiduciary duty in connection with the Company\u2019s entry into the Merger Agreement as a result of various alleged conflicts of interest facing the bank. Although we believe this suit is without merit, the defense of this action is expensive and may divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business.", "PERMNO": 75432, "SIC": 5812, "TIC": "9614B"}
