RISK FACTORS\nWe may be unable to manage our growth effectively.\nWe continued to experience core revenue growth in fiscal year 2020 as we saw the benefits of our marketing activities in all of our target markets. Revenue increased 15% to $51 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 driven by increases in the retail, home health care, assisted living, professional and pharmaceutical manufacturer markets due mainly to increased flu shot\nrelated orders, increased route-based pickup services, increased order activity for unused medication solutions, including the MedSafe and TakeAway Recovery System envelopes, an expanded relationship with a major healthcare distributor, increased COVID-19 related wasted management and targeted telemarketing initiatives and promotional activities. The increase in revenue and execution of our growth strategies has placed and will continue to place significant demands on our financial, operational and management resources. In order to continue our growth, we may need, at some point, to add operations, administrative and other personnel and to make additional investments in the infrastructure and systems. There can be no assurance that we will be able to find and train qualified personnel, do so on a timely basis or expand our operations and systems to the extent and in the time required.\nIf the flu related business of our customers decreases, the revenues generated by our business could decrease.\nOur operating results are dependent in part upon the amount and types of solutions necessary to service our customers\u2019 needs which are heavily influenced by the total number of patients our customers are serving at any time, especially related to the administration of flu shots. At times of lower patient activity, our customers have a decreased need for our services on a supplemental or peak needs basis. Our operating results can vary depending on the timing and severity of the flu season as well as other factors affecting the volume of flu shots administered in the retail setting.\nOur quarterly results may fluctuate significantly.\nOur operating results have historically varied on a quarterly basis and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future. Factors that may affect our quarterly operating results, some of which are beyond the control of management, include, but are not limited to, seasonality; the timing of inventory builds for patient support programs of our pharmaceutical manufacturer customers; the timing and severity of the flu season; fluctuations in inventory, energy, transportation, labor, healthcare and other costs; significant acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures and other strategic initiatives; and many of the other risk factors discussed herein. Accordingly, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and investors should not rely on the results of any particular quarter as an indication of our future performance.\nOur business is dependent on a small number of customers. To the extent we are not successful in winning additional business mandates from our government and commercial customers or attracting new customers, our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nWe are dependent on a small group of customers. In addition, there is an inherent concentration of credit risk associated with accounts receivable arising from sales to our major customers. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, two customers represented approximately 35% of revenues. Two of these customers also represented approximately 44%, or $5.2 million, of the total accounts receivable balance as of June 30, 2020. To the extent significant customers are delinquent or delayed in paying, or we are not successful in obtaining consistent and additional business from our existing and new customers, our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nThe loss of our senior executives could affect our ability to manage the business profitability.\nOur growth and development to date has been largely dependent on the active participation and leadership of our senior management team consisting of the Company\u2019s CEO and President, Vice President and CFO, Senior Vice President of Operations, Vice President of Operations and Vice President of Marketing. We believe that the continued success of the business is largely dependent upon the continued employment of the senior management team and have, therefore, (i) entered into individual employment arrangements with key personnel and (ii) approved the Compensation and Incentive Plan for participation by the senior management team in order to provide an incentive for their continued employment with us. The unplanned loss or illness of one or more members of the senior management team and our inability to hire key employees could disrupt and adversely impact our ability to execute our business plan.\nThe recent COVID-19 pandemic could have an adverse effect on our operations, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition\nWe are closely monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business and geographies, including how it will impact our customers, employees, suppliers, vendors, business partners and distribution channels. The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption, which could adversely affect our business operations and may materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nFor example, related to customer demand, during the period from March 2020 to May 2020, the Company saw temporary closures of about 1,000 dental, dermatology and physician practices equating to about $0.1 million in lost monthly revenue for\nthe Company. Offsetting this has been increased volumes of medical waste generated by many of the Company\u2019s long-term care customers who are utilizing the Company\u2019s systems and services to contain and dispose of PPE utilized in their facilities.\nIn addition to volatility in customer demand and buying habits, we may restrict operations if we deem it necessary or if recommended or mandated by governmental authorities which would have a further adverse impact on us. We have incurred additional costs to ensure we meet the needs of our customers, including increases in headcount for route-based, treatment and distribution personnel, pay increases for these front-line employees and working capital costs to increase inventory levels to meet expected customer demand later in the calendar year.\nFurther, our management is focused on mitigating COVID-19, which has required and will continue to require, a large investment of time and resources across our enterprise. Additionally, currently some of our employees are working remotely. An extended period of remote work arrangements could strain our business continuity plans, introduce operational risk, including but not limited to cybersecurity risks, and impair our ability to manage our business.\nIf we do not respond appropriately to the pandemic, or if customers do not perceive our response to be adequate, we could suffer damage to our reputation, which could adversely affect our business.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts us will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments that we are not able to predict, including: the severity of the virus; the duration of the outbreak; governmental, business and other actions (which could include limitations on our operations or mandates to provide products or services); the promotion of social distancing and the adoption of shelter-in-place orders affecting foot traffic in our customers\u2019 facilities; the impacts on our supply chain; the impact of the pandemic on the U.S. economic activity overall; the extent and duration of the effect on customer demand and buying patterns including spend on discretionary categories; the effects of additional customer closures or other changes to our operations; the health of and availability on our workforce and our ability to meet staffing needs in our route-based, treatment and distribution operations and other critical functions, particularly if members of our work force are quarantined as a result of exposure; any impairment in value of our tangible or intangible assets which could be recorded as a result of a weaker economic conditions; and the potential effects on our internal controls including those over financial reporting as a result of changes in working environments such as shelter-in-place and similar orders that are applicable to our employees and business partners, among others. In addition, if the pandemic continues to create disruptions or turmoil in the credit or financial markets, or impacts our credit ratings, it could adversely affect our ability to access capital on favorable terms and continue to meet our liquidity needs, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. In addition, we cannot predict the impact that COVID-19 will have on our customers, suppliers, vendors, and other business partners, and each of their financial conditions; however, any material adverse effect on these parties could adversely impact our business operations, results of operations, cash flow, and financial position. The impact of COVID-19 may also exacerbate other risks discussed herein, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. This situation is changing rapidly, and additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently.\nRisks associated with our acquisition strategy could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe expect a portion of our growth to come from acquisitions, and we continue to evaluate opportunities for acquiring businesses that may supplement our internal growth. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and purchase suitable operations. In addition, the success of any acquisition depends in part on our ability to integrate the acquired business. The process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of management\u2019s attention and our financial and other resources. There can be no assurance that any acquisitions, if completed, will be successful.\nAggressive pricing by existing competitors and the entrance of new competitors could drive down our profits and slow its growth.\nThere are several competitors who offer similar or identical products and services that facilitate the disposal of smaller quantities of medical waste. There are also a number of companies that focus specifically on the marketing of products and services, which facilitate disposal through transport by the USPS (similar to the Company\u2019s products). These companies include (i) smaller private companies or (ii) divisions of larger companies. Additionally, we compete in certain markets with Stericycle, the largest medical waste company in the country, which focuses primarily on a pickup service business model. As Sharps continues to grow and increase awareness of the proper disposal of syringes and unused medications, it could face additional and possibly significant competition. As a result, we could experience increased pricing pressures that could reduce our margins. In addition, as we expand our business into other markets, the number, type and size of our competitors may expand. Many of these potential competitors may have greater financial and operational resources, flexibility to reduce prices and other competitive advantages that could adversely impact our current competitive position.\nThe lack of customer long-term volume commitments could adversely affect the Company\u2019s profits and future growth.\nAlthough we enter into exclusive contracts with the majority of our enterprise customers, these contracts do not have provisions for firm long-term volume commitments. In general, customer purchase orders may be canceled and order volume levels can be changed or delayed with limited or no penalties. Canceled, delayed or reduced purchase orders could significantly affect our financial performance.\nThe Company is subject to extensive and costly federal, state and local laws, and existing or future regulations may restrict the Company\u2019s operations, increase our costs of operations and subject us to additional liability.\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations. We are required to obtain permits, authorizations, approvals, certificates and other types of governmental permission from the EPA, the Department of Transportation, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the State of Texas, the State of Pennsylvania and local governments with respect to our facilities and operations. Such laws, rules and regulations have been established to promote occupational safety and health standards and certain standards have been established in connection with the handling, transportation and disposal of certain types of medical and solid wastes, including transported medical waste. We believe that we are currently in compliance in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations governing our business, including the permits and authorizations for our incinerator facility. Our estimated annual costs of complying with these laws, regulations and guidelines, including environmental laws, is currently less than $200,000 per year. In the event additional laws, rules or regulations are adopted which affect our business, additional expenditures may be required for us to be in compliance with such changing laws, rules and regulations. Furthermore, any material relaxation of any existing regulatory requirements governing the transportation and disposal of medical waste could result in a reduced demand for our products and services and could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and financial condition. The scope and duration of existing and future regulations affecting the medical and solid waste disposal industry cannot be anticipated and are subject to change.\nThe inability of the Company to operate its treatment facilities would adversely affect its operations\nThe Company has two (2) fully-permitted facilities that house our processing and treatment operations. Our processing and treatment facilities which, are located in Carthage, Texas and in Nesquehoning, Pennsylvania, are currently permitted to treat and process 182 tons of medical, pharmaceutical and other healthcare related waste per day. The Company owns one of these processing and treatment facilities and leases the other. Sharps believes it operates and maintains the facilities in compliance in all material respects with all federal, state and local laws and/or any other regulatory agency requirements involving treatment and disposal and the operation of the incinerator and autoclave facilities. The failure to maintain the permits for the treatment facilities or unfavorable conditions contained in the permits or new regulations could substantially impair our operations and reduce our revenues. Any disruption in the availability of the disposal or treatment facilities, whether as a result of action taken by governmental authorities, natural disasters or otherwise, would have an adverse effect on our operations and results of operations.\nThe handling, transportation and disposal or treatment of regulated waste carries with it the risk of personal injury to employees and others.\nOur business requires us to handle materials that may be infectious or hazardous to life and property in other ways. Although our products and procedures are designed to minimize exposure to these materials, the possibility of accidents, leaks, spills and acts of God always exists. Examples of possible exposure to such materials include: truck accidents, damaged or leaking containers, improper storage of regulated waste by customers, improper placement by customers of materials into the waste stream that we are not authorized or able to process, such as certain body parts and tissues; or malfunctioning treatment plant equipment. Human beings, animals or property could be injured, sickened or damaged by exposure to regulated waste. This in turn could result in lawsuits in which we are found liable for such injuries, and substantial damages could be awarded against us. While we carry liability insurance intended to cover these contingencies, particular instances may occur that are not insured against or that are inadequately insured against. An uninsured or underinsured loss could be substantial and could impair our profitability and reduce our liquidity.\nIncreases in transportation costs may adversely affect our business and results of operation.\nWe maintain a transportation network and a fleet of transportation vehicles. A significant increase in market prices for trucks, fuel or driver wages could adversely affect our business through higher transportation costs and reduce our operating margins and reported results of operations.\nRestrictions in our Credit Agreement could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and value of our securities.\nThe Credit Agreement and the Loan Agreement, as defined in Note 5 \u201cNotes Payable and Long-Term Debt\u201d in \u201cNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements,\u201d contain affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, require the Company to maintain a maximum cash flow leverage ratio of no more than 3.0 to 1.0 and a minimum debt service coverage ratio of not less than 1.15 to 1.00. The Credit Agreement, which expires on March 29, 2021 for the working capital portion of the Credit Agreement, and the Loan Agreement also contain customary events of default which, if uncured, may terminate the agreements and require immediate repayment of all indebtedness to the lenders. The leverage ratio covenant may limit the amount of our borrowing available under the agreements. These covenants could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to have sufficient funding or otherwise to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise.\nOur ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in the Credit Agreement and the Loan Agreement may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial, and industry conditions. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate, our ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. A failure to comply with these provisions could result in a default or an event of default. Upon an event of default, unless waived, the lenders could elect to terminate commitments, cease making further loans, require cash collateralization of letters of credit, cause its loans to become due and payable in full and force us into bankruptcy or liquidation. If the payment of our debt is accelerated, our assets may be insufficient to repay such debt in full, and the holders of our stock could experience a partial or total loss of their investment.\nAn inability to win additional government contracts could have a material adverse effect on our operations and adversely affect our future revenue.\nAlthough the Company has secured some U.S. government business during fiscal year 2020, there can be no assurances that future periods will include similar business. All contracts with, or subcontracts involving, the federal government are terminable or subject to renegotiation by the applicable governmental agency on 30-day notice at the option of the governmental agency. If a material contract is terminated or renegotiated in a manner that is materially adverse to us, our revenues and future operations could be materially adversely affected.\nAs a government contractor, we are subject to extensive government regulation, and our failure to comply with applicable regulations could subject us to penalties that may restrict our ability to conduct our business.\nGovernmental contracts or subcontracts involving governmental facilities are often subject to specific procurement regulations, contract provisions and a variety of other requirements relating to the formation, administration, performance and accounting of these contracts. Many of these contracts include express or implied certifications of compliance with applicable regulations and contractual provisions. If we fail to comply with any regulations, requirements or statutes, our existing governmental contracts or subcontracts involving governmental facilities could be terminated, or we could be suspended from government contracting or subcontracting. If one or more of our governmental contracts or subcontracts are terminated for any reason, or if we are suspended or barred from government work, we could suffer a significant reduction in expected revenues and profits. Furthermore, as a result of our governmental contracts or subcontracts involving governmental facilities, claims for civil or criminal fraud may be brought by the government for violations of these regulations, requirements or statutes.\nThe possibility of postal work interruptions and restrictions on shipping through the mail would adversely affect the disposal or treatment element of the Company\u2019s business and have an adverse effect on our operations, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe currently transport (from the patient or user to our facilities or subcontracted treatment facilities) the majority of our solution offerings using USPS. Therefore, any long-term interruption in USPS delivery services would disrupt the return transportation and treatment element of our business. Additionally, since USPS employees are federal employees, such employees may be prohibited from engaging in or continuing a postal work stoppage, although there can be no assurance that such work stoppage can be avoided. As noted above, we entered into an arrangement with UPS whereby UPS transports certain other solution offerings. The ability to ship items, whether through the USPS or UPS, is regulated by the government and related agencies. Any change in regulation restricting the shipping of medical waste, used healthcare materials or unused or expired dispensed pharmaceuticals through these channels would be detrimental to our ability to conduct operations. Any disruption in the transportation of products would have an adverse effect on our operations, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, low trading volume and price volatility.\nThe Company\u2019s common stock is quoted on the NASDAQ Capital Market (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d) under the symbol \u201cSMED.\u201d The daily trading volumes for our common stock are, and may continue to be, relatively small compared to many other publicly traded securities. Over the past three years, the Company\u2019s common stock has had an average trading volume of approximately 58,000 shares traded per month. It may be difficult for investors to sell shares in the public market at any given time at prevailing prices, and the price of our common stock may, therefore, be volatile.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of federal securities laws, and compliance with such requirements can be expensive and may divert resources from other projects, thus impairing our ability to grow.\nWe are subject to the information and reporting requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), and other federal securities laws, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d) and the Dodd-Frank Act Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d). The costs of preparing and filing annual and quarterly reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission and furnishing audited reports to stockholders will cause our expenses to be higher than they would have been if we were privately held.\nIt may be time consuming, difficult and costly for us to develop, implement and maintain the internal controls and reporting procedures required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act. We may need to hire additional financial reporting, internal controls and other finance personnel in order to develop and implement appropriate internal controls and reporting procedures.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain an effective system of internal control, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or to prevent fraud. An inability to report and file our financial results accurately and timely could harm our reputation and adversely impact the trading price of our common stock.\nEffective internal control is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent and detect errors or fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent or detect errors or fraud, we may not be able to manage our business as effectively as we would if an effective control environment existed, and our business and reputation with investors may be harmed. As a result, our small size and any current internal control deficiencies may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operation and access to capital. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with any policies and procedures may deteriorate.\nWe may be subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches in data security.\nWe rely upon sophisticated information technology systems, infrastructure and security procedures and systems to operate our business and ensure the secure storage and transmission of information. The size and complexity of our computer systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion and random attack. Likewise, computer networks and the internet are, by nature, vulnerable to unauthorized access. An accidental or willful security breach could result in unauthorized access and/or use of sensitive data. Our security measures could be breached by third-party action, computer viruses, accidents or error or misconduct by an employee or contractor. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or to sabotage computer systems change frequently, it may be difficult to detect immediately and we may be unable to implement adequate preventive measures. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means, including hacking into our systems or facilities, fraud, trickery or other means of deceiving employees, contractors and temporary staff. We have encountered threats of this type from time to time, none of which have materially impacted our operations or financial results. Although we maintain a system of information security and controls, a party that is able to circumvent our security measures could cause interruption in our operations, damage our computers or those of our users or otherwise damage our reputation. Depending on the severity, any of these events could adversely affect our operations and financial results. In addition, if we were to experience an information security breach, we may be required to expend significant amounts of time and money to remedy, protect against or mitigate the effect of the breach, and we may not be able to remedy the situation in a timely manner, or at all. While we have invested in protection of data and information technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business.", "PERMNO": 92935, "SIC": 4955, "TIC": "SMED"}
