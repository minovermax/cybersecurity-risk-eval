{"cik": "354963", "company": "SHENANDOAH TELECOMMUNICATIONS CO/VA/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-25", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS\nOur business and operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. The risks set forth under \"Part I Item 1. Business\" and the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business. The following risks (or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us) could materially affect our financial condition, liquidity, or operating results, as well as the price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nIntensifying competition may limit our ability to sustain profitable operations.\nAs new technologies are developed and deployed by competitors in our service area, some of our subscribers may select other providers\u2019 offerings based on price, capabilities or personal preferences. Most of our competitors possess greater resources, have greater brand recognition, have more extensive coverage areas, have access to spectrum or technologies not available to us, are able to offer bundled service offerings that we are not able to duplicate and offer more services than we do. If significant numbers of our subscribers elect to move to competing providers, or if market saturation limits the rate of new subscriber additions, we may not be able to sustain profitable operations.\nThe Company\u2019s revenue from fiber leases may be adversely impacted by price competition for these facilities.\nConsumers are increasingly accessing video content from alternative sources, such as Internet-based \u201cover the top\u201d providers such as Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu, and related platforms. The influx of competitors in this area, together with the development of new technologies to support them, are resulting in significant changes in the video business models and regulatory provisions that have applied to the provision of video and other services. These developments have led to a loss of video subscribers due to \"cord cutting\" as customers adopt alternative sources and may lead to a decline in the demand, price and profitability of our cable and related video services.\nIncumbent cable companies also face competition from direct broadcast satellite providers, and from large providers of wireline telecommunications services (such as Verizon, CenturyLink and AT&T), which have upgraded their networks in certain markets outside of our cable footprint to provide video services in addition to voice and broadband services and may offer bundled service offerings that we are not able to duplicate. Wireless providers are also entering the market for video services by making such services available on handsets and tablets. In some areas, direct broadcast satellite providers have partnered with large incumbent telecommunications service providers to offer triple-play services.\nNationwide, incumbent local exchange carriers have experienced a decrease in access lines due to the effect of wireless and wireline competition. We have experienced reductions in the number of access lines to date, and based on industry experience we anticipate that the long-term trend toward declining telephone subscriber counts will continue. There is a significant risk that this downward trend will have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s landline telephone operations in the future.\nOur future growth is partially dependent upon our edge-out strategy, which may or may not be successful.\nWe are strategically focused on driving growth by expanding our broadband network in order to provide service in communities that are near or adjacent to our network. This edge-out strategy includes our fiber to the home and fixed wireless broadband services, which we offer under the Glo Fiber and Beam Internet brands, respectively. These brands are relatively new in the marketplace. This strategy requires considerable management resources and capital investment and it is uncertain whether and when it will contribute to positive free cash flow. As a result, we expect our capital expenditures to exceed the cash flow provided from continuing operations through 2023. Additionally, we must obtain pole attachment agreements, franchises, construction permits, and other regulatory approvals to commence operations in these communities. Delays in entering into pole attachment agreements, receiving the necessary franchises and construction permits, procuring needed contractors, materials or supplies, and conducting the construction itself could adversely impact our scheduled construction plans. Difficulty in obtaining necessary resources may also adversely affect our ability to expand into new markets. We may face resistance from competitors who are already in markets we wish to enter. If our expectations regarding our ability to attract customers in these communities are not met, or if the capital requirements to complete the network investment or the\ntime required to attract our expected level of customers are incorrect, our financial performance may be negatively impacted.\nMany of our competitors are larger than we are and possess greater resources than we do.\nIn some instances, we compete against companies with fewer regulatory burdens, greater personnel resources, greater resources for marketing, greater brand name recognition, and long-established relationships with regulatory authorities and customers. We are realigning our corporate expenses to reflect the forthcoming sale of our Wireless assets and operations. This initiative will take multiple years and be enabled by certain of our information technology initiatives. If we are unable to sufficiently build the necessary infrastructure and internal support functions to scale and expand our network and customer base, our potential growth would be limited. We may not be able to successfully compete with these competitors or be able to make the operational or financial investments necessary to successfully serve the targeted customer base.\nAlternative technologies, changes in the regulatory environment and current uncertainties in the marketplace may reduce future demand for existing telecommunication services.\nThe telecommunications industry is experiencing significant technological change, evolving industry standards, ongoing improvements in the capacity and quality of digital technology, shorter development cycles for new products and enhancements and changes in end-user requirements and preferences. Technological advances, industry changes, changes in the regulatory environment and the availability of additional spectrum or additional flexibility with respect to the use of currently available spectrum could cause the technology we use to become obsolete. We may not be able to respond to such changes and implement new technology on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost. Additionally, we may be required to select one developing or new technology over another and may not choose the technology that is ultimately determined to be the most economic, efficient or attractive to customers. We may also encounter difficulties in implementing new technologies, products and services and may encounter disruptions in service as a result.\nOur distribution networks may be subject to weather-related events that may damage our networks and adversely impact our ability to deliver promised services or increase costs related to such events.\nOur distribution networks may be subject to weather-related events that could damage our networks and impact service delivery. Some published reports predict that warming global temperatures will increase the frequency and severity of such weather-related events. Should such predictions be correct or if for other reasons there are more weather-related events, and should such events impact the Mid-Atlantic region covered by our networks more frequently or more severely than in the past, our revenues and expenses could be materially adversely impacted.\nOur programming costs are subject to demands for increased payments.\nThe cable television industry has continued to experience an increase in the cost of programming, especially sports programming and retransmission fees. In addition, as we add programming to our video services for existing customers or distribute existing programming to more customers, we incur increased programming expenses. Broadcasters affiliated with major over-the-air network services have been increasing their demands for cash payments and other concessions for the right to carry local network television signals on our cable systems. As compared to large national providers, our smaller base of subscribers limits our ability to negotiate lower programming costs. If we are unable to raise our customers\u2019 rates, these increased programming costs could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Moreover, as our programming contracts and retransmission agreements with programming providers expire, there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms which could lead to a loss of video customers.\nNegative outcomes of legal proceedings may adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe may become involved in legal proceedings from time to time. These proceedings may be complicated, costly and disruptive to our business operations. We might also incur significant expenses in defending these matters or may be required to pay significant fines, awards and settlements. Any of these potential outcomes, such as judgments, awards, settlements or orders could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results or our ability to do business.\nWe may not benefit from our acquisition strategy.\nAs part of our business strategy, we regularly evaluate opportunities to enhance the value of the Company by pursuing acquisitions of other businesses. Although we remain subject to financial and other covenants in our credit agreement that may limit our ability to pursue certain strategic opportunities, we intend to continue to evaluate and, when appropriate, pursue strategic acquisition opportunities as they arise. We cannot provide any assurance, however, with respect to the timing, likelihood, size or financial effect of any potential transaction involving the Company, as we may not be successful in identifying and consummating any acquisition or in integrating any newly acquired business into our operations.\nThe evaluation of business acquisition opportunities and the integration of any acquired businesses pose a number of significant risks, including the following:\n\u2022acquisitions may place significant strain on our management, financial and other resources by requiring us to expend a substantial amount of time and resources in the pursuit of acquisitions that we may not complete, or to devote significant attention to the various integration efforts of any newly acquired businesses, all of which will require the allocation of limited resources;\n\u2022acquisitions may not have a positive impact on our cash flows or financial performance;\n\u2022even if acquired companies eventually contribute to an increase in our cash flows or financial performance, such acquisitions may adversely affect our operating results in the short term as a result of transaction-related expenses we will have to pay or the higher operating and administrative expenses we may incur in the periods immediately following an acquisition as we seek to integrate the acquired business into our operations;\n\u2022we may not be able to realize anticipated synergies, achieve the desired level of integration of the acquired business or eliminate as many redundant costs;\n\u2022we may not be able to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers and other business partners of the acquired business;\n\u2022our operating and financial systems and controls and information services may not be compatible with those of the companies we may acquire and may not be adequate to support our integration efforts, and any steps we take to improve these systems and controls may not be sufficient;\n\u2022our business plans and projections used to justify the acquisitions and expansion investments are based on assumptions of revenues per subscriber, penetration rates in specific markets where we operate and expected operating costs. These assumptions may not develop as projected, which may negatively impact our profitability or the value of our intangible assets;\n\u2022growth through acquisitions will increase our need for qualified personnel, who may not be available to us or, if they were employed by a business we acquire, remain with us after the acquisition; and\n\u2022acquired businesses may have unexpected liabilities and contingencies, which could be significant.\nAdverse economic conditions in the United States and in our market area involving significantly reduced consumer spending could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nUnfavorable general economic conditions could negatively affect our business. Although it is difficult to predict the impact of general economic conditions on our business, these conditions could adversely affect the affordability of, and customer demand for our services, and could cause customers to delay or forgo purchases of our services. Any national economic weakness, restricted credit markets, or high unemployment rates could depress consumer spending and harm our operating performance. In addition, any material adverse economic conditions that affect our geographic markets in particular could have a disproportionately negative impact on our results.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted, and the future outbreak of other highly infectious or contagious diseases could disrupt, the operation of our business resulting in adverse impacts to our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow and could create significant volatility in the trading and value of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nSince being reported in December 2019, an outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) has spread globally, including to every state in the United States. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic and the United States declared a national emergency. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets, and another pandemic in the future could have similar effects. Given the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances, it is difficult to predict the impact of COVID-19 on the Company, and there is no guarantee that efforts by Shentel, designed to address adverse impacts of the coronavirus, will be effective.\nGovernments in the markets in which we operate have taken a number of actions in response to the pandemic, including mandating that residents stay at home, temporarily closing businesses that are not considered essential and limiting hours of businesses or the number of customers that may be served.\nThe Company has also limited non-essential travel, in-person meetings and large employee meetings, while also implementing a work-from-home policy to encourage all employees whose job responsibilities permit remote working to do so. Our transition to a work-from-home policy for many employees could impact the ability of our employees to advance research and development projects as efficiently or productively as they could in an office setting. The extent and duration of ongoing workplace restrictions and limitations, particularly in sites with significant headcount, could adversely impact our operations and our ability to execute on strategic imperatives for our business. Continued restrictions on travel and limitations on interaction with customers may impact our sales and marketing activities, including our ability to secure new customers, to qualify and sell new products, or to grow sales with customers where or with whom we do not have a longer-standing supply relationship.\nIn addition, the current COVID-19 pandemic, or a future pandemic, could have material and adverse effects on our ability to successfully operate and on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows due to, among other factors:\n\u2022additional disruptions or delays in our operations or network performance, as well as network maintenance and construction, testing, supervisory and customer support activities, and inventory and supply procurement;\n\u2022increases in operating costs, inventory shortages and/or a decrease in productivity related to travel bans and social distancing efforts, which could include delays in our ability to install broadband services at customer locations or require our vendors and contractors to incur additional costs that may be passed on to us;\n\u2022a deterioration in our ability to operate in affected areas or delays in the supply of products or services to us from vendors that are needed for our efficient operations;\n\u2022increases in health insurance and labor-related costs arising from illness, quarantine and the implementation of social distancing and work-from-home measures;\n\u2022increased risk of phishing and other cybersecurity attacks, and increased risk of unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information about us, our customers or other third parties as a result of employees or third-party vendors' employees working remotely;\n\u2022a decrease in the ability of our counterparties to meet their obligations to us in full, or at all;\n\u2022a general reduction in business and economic activity may severely impact our customers and may cause them to be unable to pay for services provided; and\n\u2022the potential negative impact on the health of our personnel, particularly if a significant number of them are impacted, could result in a deterioration in our ability to ensure business continuity during a disruption.\nShentel has implemented policies and procedures designed to mitigate the risk of adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, or a future pandemic, on the Company\u2019s operations, but may incur additional costs to ensure continuity of\nbusiness operations caused by COVID-19, or other future pandemics, which could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. However, the extent of such impacts will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and actions taken to contain COVID-19 or its impact. Additionally, to the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, financial condition or results of operations, it may heighten other risks described in this \"Risk Factors\" section.\nWe have an underfunded non-contributory defined benefit pension plan.\nThrough our acquisition of nTelos, we assumed nTelos\u2019 non-contributory defined benefit pension plan and other post-retirement benefit plans, covering all employees who met eligibility requirements and were employed by nTelos prior to October 1, 2003. This pension plan was closed to nTelos employees hired on or after October 1, 2003. As of December 31, 2020, the plan was underfunded by approximately $8.0 million. Refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, included with the Notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the accounting for the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. We do not expect that we will be required to make a cash contribution to the underfunded pension plan in 2021, but we may be required to make cash contributions in future periods depending on the level of interest rates and investment returns on plan assets.\nDisruptions of our information technology infrastructure could harm our business.\nWe depend on our information technology infrastructure to achieve our business objectives. A disruption of our infrastructure could be caused by a natural disaster, manufacturing failure, telecommunications system failure, cybersecurity or terrorist attack, intrusion or incident, or defective or improperly installed new or upgraded business management systems. Although we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of the Company's information technology infrastructure, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging, especially in light of the growing sophistication of cyber-attacks and intrusions sponsored by state or other interests. Portions of our information technology infrastructure also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time. In the event of any such disruption, we may be unable to conduct our business in the normal course. Moreover, our business involves the processing, storage and transmission of data, which would also be negatively affected by such an event. A disruption of our infrastructure could cause us to lose customers and revenue, particularly during a period of heavy demand for our services. We also could incur significant expense in repairing system damage and taking other remedial measures.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting that, if not properly corrected, could materially adversely affect our operations and result in material misstatements in our financial statements.\nIn accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we, along with our independent registered public accounting firm, are required to report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. Failure to design and maintain effective internal controls could constitute a material weakness which could result in inaccurate financial statements, inaccurate disclosures or failure to prevent fraud.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we did not maintain an effective control environment attributable to certain identified material weaknesses. We describe these material weaknesses in Item 9A. Controls and Procedures in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The identified control deficiencies create a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement to the consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis, and therefore we concluded that the deficiencies represent material weaknesses in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting and our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2020. We cannot provide any assurance that these weaknesses will be effectively remediated or that additional material weaknesses will not occur in the future. The existence of these or other material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting could also result in errors in our financial statements that could require us to restate our financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and cause stockholders to lose confidence in our reported financial information, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business and stock price.\nImplementation of our new ERP system could disrupt business operations.\nOur current ERP system will no longer be supported by the software vendor after January 2023. We are planning to implement a new ERP system over the next 18 months to replace the current system. Implementing a new ERP system is not only costly but complex and difficult. The implementation requires significant investments of time, money and resources and may result in the diversion of senior management\u2019s attention from our ongoing operations. Furthermore, the implementation will result in changes to many of our existing operational, financial and administrative business processes. The new ERP system will require both the implementation of new internal controls and changes to existing internal control frameworks and procedures. If unexpected delays, technical problems or other significant issues arise in connection with the implementation, it could have a material negative impact on our operations, business, financial results and financial condition. There can be no assurance that we will successfully implement our new ERP system or that we will avoid these and other negative impacts from our implementation efforts.\nOur success largely depends on our ability to retain and recruit key personnel, and any failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to manage our business.\nOur operational results have depended, and our future results will depend, upon the retention and continued performance of our management team, as well as the attraction and retention of relevant engineering and construction resources. The competitive environment for these talents in our industry could adversely impact our ability to retain and hire new key employees and contractors. The loss of the services of key members of management and the inability or delay in hiring new key employees and contractors could adversely affect our ability to manage our business and our future operational and financial results. Moreover, an inability to attract and retain sufficient qualified accounting personnel could adversely affect our ability to maintain an effective system of internal controls or our ability to produce reliable financial reports, which could materially and adversely affect our business and our stock price.\nWe could suffer a loss of revenue and increased costs, exposure to significant liability, reputational harm and other serious negative consequences if we sustain cyber-attacks or other data security breaches that disrupt our operations or result in the dissemination of proprietary or confidential information about us or our customers or other third parties.\nWe utilize our information technology infrastructure to manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our operations. We routinely process, store and transmit large amounts of data for our customers, including sensitive and personally identifiable information. We depend on our information technology infrastructure to conduct business operations and provide customer services. We may be subject to data breaches and disruptions of the information technology systems we use for these purposes. Our industry has witnessed an increase in the number, intensity and sophistication of cybersecurity incidents caused by hackers and other malicious actors such as foreign governments, criminals, hacktivists, terrorists and insider threats. Hackers and other malicious actors may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential, sensitive, personal or proprietary information, or that of third parties, and engage in the unauthorized use or dissemination of such information. They may be able to create system disruptions, or cause shutdowns. Hackers and other malicious actors may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, ransomware and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our systems. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including \u201cbugs,\u201d cybersecurity vulnerabilities and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation or security of our systems.\nThe shift to our workforce working remotely as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic has amplified certain risks to our operations and business, including increased demand on our information technology infrastructure and systems, increased phishing and other cybersecurity attacks as hackers and malicious actors try to exploit the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and an increase in the number of points of potential attack, such as laptops and mobile devices (both of which are now being used in increased numbers), and any failure to effectively manage these risks, including to timely identify and appropriately respond to any cyber-attacks, may adversely affect our business.\nTo date, interruptions of our information technology infrastructure have been infrequent and have not had a material impact on our operations. However, because technology is increasingly complex and cyber-attacks are increasingly sophisticated and more frequent, there can be no assurance that such incidents will not have a material adverse effect\non us in the future. The consequences of a breach of our security measures, a cyber-related service or operational disruption, or a breach of personal, confidential, proprietary or sensitive data caused by a hacker or other malicious actor could be significant for us, our customers and other affected third parties. For example, the consequences could include damage to infrastructure and property, impairment of business operations, disruptions to customer service, financial costs and harm to our liquidity, costs associated with remediation, loss of revenues, loss of customers, competitive disadvantage, legal expenses associated with litigation, regulatory action, fines or penalties or damage to our brand and reputation.\nIn addition, the costs to us to eliminate or address the foregoing security challenges and vulnerabilities before or after a cyber incident could be significant. In addition, our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service. We could also lose existing or potential customers for our services in connection with any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in the services.\nWe are subject to laws, rules and regulations relating to the collection, use and security of user data. Our operations are also subject to federal and state laws governing information security. In the event of a data breach or operational disruption caused by an information security incident, such rules may require consumer and government agency notification and may result in regulatory enforcement actions with the potential of monetary forfeitures as well as civil litigation. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, expenses to comply with privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards and contractual obligations.\nRisks Related to Regulation and Legislation\nRegulation by government agencies may increase our costs of providing service or require changes in services, either of which could impair our financial performance.\nOur operations are subject to varying degrees of regulation by the FCC, the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, as well as by state and local regulatory agencies and franchising authorities. Action by these regulatory bodies could negatively affect our operations and our costs of doing business.\nChanges to key regulatory requirements can affect our ability to compete.\nOur industry is subject to extensive governmental regulation, which impacts many aspects of our operations. Legislators and regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing, and sometimes do change, existing statutes, regulations, and interpretations thereof. Future legislative, judicial, or administrative actions may increase our costs or impose additional challenges and restrictions on our business.\nFederal law strictly limits the scope of permissible cable rate regulation, and none of our local franchising authorities currently regulate our rates for video services. Our rates for broadband services have historically not been subject to rate regulation. However, as broadband service is increasingly viewed as an essential service, governments could adopt new laws or regulations related to the prices we charge for our services that could adversely impact our existing business model.\nThe Company operates cable television systems in largely rural areas of Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland and Kentucky pursuant to local franchise agreements. These franchises are not exclusive, and other entities may secure franchise authorizations in the future, thereby increasing direct competition to the Company.\nMany franchises establish comprehensive facilities and service requirements, as well as specific customer service standards and monetary penalties for non-compliance. In many cases, franchises are terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with significant provisions set forth in the franchise agreement governing system operations. Franchises are generally granted for fixed terms and must be periodically renewed. Franchising authorities may resist granting a renewal if either past performance or the prospective operating proposal is considered inadequate. Franchise authorities often demand concessions or other commitments as a condition to renewal. If our local franchises are not renewed at expiration we would have to cease operations or, operate under either temporary operating agreements or without a franchise while negotiating renewal terms with the local franchising authorities. Although we have historically renewed our franchises without incurring significant costs, we cannot offer assurance that we will be able to renew, or to renew as favorably, our franchises in the future. A termination of or a sustained failure to renew a franchise in one or more key markets or obtaining such franchise on unfavorable terms could adversely affect our business in the affected geographic area.\nPole attachments are wires and cables that are attached to utility poles. Cable system attachments to investor-owned public utility poles historically have been regulated at the federal or state level, generally resulting in reasonable pole attachment rates for attachments used to provide cable service. In contrast, utility poles owned by municipalities or cooperatives are not subject to federal regulation and are, with exceptions, generally exempt from state regulation and their attachment rates tend to be higher. Future regulatory changes in this area could impact the pole attachment rates we pay utility companies.\nThe FCC has periodically considered proposals for new regulations intended to make our cable set-top boxes open to other service providers. If enacted, such new regulations concerning set-top boxes could increase our cost for equipment, affect our relationship with our customers, and/or enable third parties to try to offer equipment that accesses disaggregated cable content merged with other services delivered over the Internet to compete with our premium service offerings.\nIncreases in broadband usage may cause network capacity limitations, resulting in service disruptions, reduced capacity or slower transmission speeds for our customers.\nVideo streaming services, gaming and peer-to-peer file sharing applications use significantly more bandwidth than other Internet activity such as web browsing and email. As use of these newer services continues to grow, our broadband customers will likely use much more bandwidth than in the past. If this occurs, we could be required to make significant capital expenditures to increase network capacity in order to avoid service disruptions, service degradation or slower transmission speeds for our customers. Alternatively, we could choose to implement network management practices to reduce the network capacity available to bandwidth-intensive activities during certain times in market areas experiencing congestion, which could negatively affect our ability to retain and attract customers in affected markets. Competitive or regulatory constraints may preclude us from recovering costs of network investments designed to address these issues, which could adversely impact our operating margins, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur services may be adversely impacted by legislative or regulatory changes that affect our ability to develop and offer services or that could expose us to liability from customers or others.\nThe Company provides broadband Internet access services to its cable and telephone customers through cable modems and DSL. As the Internet has matured, it has become the subject of increasing regulatory interest. Congress and Federal regulators have adopted a wide range of measures directly or potentially affecting Internet use. The adoption of new Internet regulations or policies could adversely affect our business.\nIn 2015, the FCC determined that broadband Internet access services, such as those we offer, were a form of \u201ctelecommunications service\u201d under the Communications Act and, on that basis, imposed rules banning service providers from blocking access to lawful content, restricting data rates for downloading lawful content, prohibiting the attachment of non-harmful devices, giving special transmission priority to affiliates, and offering third parties the ability to pay for priority routing. The 2015 rules also imposed a \u201ctransparency\u201d requirement, i.e., an obligation to disclose all material terms and conditions of our service to consumers.\nIn December 2017, the FCC adopted an order repudiating its prior (2015) treatment of broadband as a \u201ctelecommunications service,\u201d reclassifying broadband as an \u201cinformation service,\u201d and eliminating the rules it had imposed at that time (other than a transparency/disclosure-requirement, which it eased in significant ways). The FCC also ruled that state regulators may not impose obligations similar to federal obligations that the FCC removed. Various parties have challenged this ruling in court, and, we cannot predict how any such court challenges will be resolved. Moreover, it is possible that the FCC might further revise its approach to broadband Internet access, or that Congress might enact legislation affecting the rules applicable to the service. In 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia upheld the information service reclassification, but vacated the FCC\u2019s blanket prohibition of state utility regulation of broadband services. The court left open the possibility that individual state laws could still be deemed preempted on a case-by-case basis if it is shown that they conflict with federal law. In October 2020 the FCC, responding to the court\u2019s remand order, issued a further decision clarifying certain aspects of its earlier order. In this decision the FCC re-classified broadband internet access service as an unregulated information service, thus eliminating all federal regulatory \"network neutrality\" obligations beyond requiring broadband providers to accurately disclose network management practices, performance, and commercial terms of service. These issues may be revisited by the FCC in the current Administration.\nThe FCC imposes obligations on telecommunications service providers, including broadband Internet access service providers, and multichannel video program distributors, like our cable company, intended to ensure that individuals with disabilities are able to access and use telecommunications and video programming services and equipment. We cannot predict the nature and pace these requirements and other developments, or the impact they may have on our operations.\nOur business may be impacted by new or changing tax laws or regulations and actions by federal, state and/or local agencies, or how judicial authorities apply tax laws.\nWe expect to pay over $400 million in federal and state income taxes in 2021 from the pending sale of our Wireless assets and operations to T-Mobile. If federal or state income tax rates are increased during 2021, we could pay more income taxes and may need to reduce the expected special dividend payable to shareholders, raise additional indebtedness or lower our available liquidity.\nIn connection with the products and services we sell, we calculate, collect and remit various federal, state and local taxes, surcharges and regulatory fees to numerous federal, state and local governmental authorities, including federal USF contributions and regulatory fees. In addition, we incur and pay state and local taxes and fees on purchases of goods and services used in our business.\nTax laws are subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. In many cases, the application of tax laws is uncertain and subject to differing interpretations, especially when evaluated against new technologies and telecommunications services, such as broadband internet access and cloud related services.\nIn the event that we have incorrectly calculated, assessed or remitted amounts that were due to governmental authorities, we could be subject to additional taxes, fines, penalties or other adverse actions, which could materially impact our business, financial condition and operating results. In the event that federal, state and/or local municipalities were to significantly increase taxes on our network, operations or services, or seek to impose new taxes, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results or ability to do business.\nRisks Related to the Sale of our Discontinued Wireless Operations\nThe sale of our discontinued Wireless operations is pending and may not close.\nOur discontinued Wireless operations have been an affiliate of Sprint since 1999.\nOn August 26, 2020, Sprint Corporation (\u201cSprint\u201d), an indirect subsidiary of T-Mobile US, Inc., (\"T-Mobile\"), on behalf of and as the direct or indirect owner of Sprint PCS, delivered notice to the Company exercising its option to purchase the assets and operations of our Wireless operations, (\"Shentel Wireless\"), for 90% of the \u201cEntire Business Value\u201d (as defined under our affiliate agreement and determined pursuant to the appraisal process set forth therein). Shortly thereafter, the Company committed to a plan to sell the discontinued Wireless operations.\nThe final and binding appraisal process was completed on February 1, 2021. Expected sale proceeds are $1.95 billion based upon the appraisal process and other agreements between the parties.\nWe expect to enter into a definitive asset purchase agreement with T-Mobile during the first quarter 2021 and expect that the transaction will close during the second quarter 2021, subject to customary closing conditions and required regulatory approvals.\nThe Company currently expects to use the after-tax proceeds from the sale of Shentel Wireless to, among other things:\n\u2022As required by our credit agreement, repay approximately $702 million of outstanding term loans and swap liabilities and terminate the respective agreement;\n\u2022Issue a special dividend of $18.75 per share to Shentel's shareholders (the \"Special Dividend\");\n\u2022Provide adequate liquidity for growth and potential strategic acquisitions; and\n\u2022Provide liquidity for general corporate purposes.\nWhile the Company expects to pay the special dividend after the close of the Wireless sale, this declaration is subject to the approval of Shentel\u2019s Board of Directors.\nIt is uncertain if we will be able to agree to terms with T-Mobile on the asset purchase agreement, secure the required regulatory approvals and close on the transaction with T-Mobile. If we do not close on the transaction with T-Mobile, we will not be able to declare and pay a special dividend to our shareholders, our ability to continue to profitably operate our wireless business may be compromised and this could cause significant volatility in the trading and value of our common stock.\nIn the event that the sale of our discontinued Wireless operations does not close, our ability to comply with the financial covenants under the agreement governing our secured credit facilities will depend primarily on our success in generating sufficient operating cash flow. Under our credit agreement, we are subject to a total leverage ratio covenant, a minimum debt service coverage ratio covenant and a minimum liquidity test. Industry conditions and financial, business and other factors, including those we identify as risk factors in this and our other reports, will affect our ability to generate the cash flows we need to satisfy those financial tests and ratios. Our failure to satisfy the tests or ratios could result in a default and acceleration of repayment of the indebtedness under our credit facilities. If the maturity of our indebtedness were accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds to repay such indebtedness. In such event, to the extent permitted by our credit agreement and applicable law, our lenders would be entitled to proceed against the collateral securing the indebtedness, which includes substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries.\nBecause our Wireless segment has historically represented a large portion of our consolidated revenue, if the sale to of our Wireless assets and operations to T-Mobile is completed, our business will be substantially different.\nThe revenue generated from our Wireless segment for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 constituted approximately 67%, 70% and 71% of our consolidated revenue for those years, respectively. Although we expect the revenue generated from our remaining segments to grow in the future, our business will be substantially different following the sale to of our Wireless assets and operations to T-Mobile, and there can be no assurance that we will achieve sustained growth, reduce Corporate overhead expenses or achieve improvement in our financial condition and results of operations in our remaining segments or in new products or business opportunities we may pursue.\nIn addition, since our focus following the closing of the sale will be on building long-term shareholder value with our remaining segments, investors and analysts may have different expectations for our company to produce improved quarterly financial results for our remaining segments as compared to the periods prior to the sale to of our Wireless assets and operations. This might cause fluctuations in our stock price as well as distractions for our management and our board of directors, and might at times conflict with our desire to build long-term stockholder value.\nOur stockholders may not receive any distribution from the sale of our Wireless assets and operations and may never receive any return of value.\nThe Company\u2019s Board of Directors has not made a final determination of the use of the proceeds from the sale of our Wireless assets and operations to T-Mobile. The Company may use the net proceeds from the sale for general corporate purposes, which may include, without limitation, funding growth initiatives, strategic acquisition opportunities, repayment or refinancing of debt or other corporate obligations, capital expenditures, working capital, and repurchases and redemptions of securities. Stockholders may not directly receive any liquidity from the sale and the only return to them may be based on any future appreciation in our stock price or upon a future sale or liquidation of us. Much depends on our future business, including the success or failure of our remaining business. There are no assurances that we will be successful, and current stockholders may never receive a return on their investment.\nThere can be no assurances that we will be successful in investing the proceeds of the sale of our Wireless assets and operations.\nThe process to identify potential investment opportunities, growth initiatives, strategic acquisition opportunities and to evaluate the future returns therefrom and business prospects thereof can be time consuming and uncertain. Our management could spend or invest the proceeds from the sale of our Wireless assets and operations in ways with which our stockholders may not agree, and our management and the Board of Directors may authorize such spending or investment without seeking stockholder approval. The investment of these proceeds may not yield a favorable return and there can be no assurances that we will be successful in the investment of these proceeds.\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness\nWe are required to repay all outstanding amounts under our credit agreements when the sale of our discontinued Wireless operations closes. We may not be able to obtain additional credit facilities on terms that are acceptable to us or as favorable as those of our existing facilities.\nUnder the agreement governing our secured credit facilities, we are required to repay all of our term loans and terminate our $75 million revolving credit facility when the sale of our discontinued Wireless operations closes.\nWe may not be able to issue new indebtedness to recapitalize our continuing operations under terms that we find acceptable. If we do not raise additional indebtedness, we may have to scale back our network edge-out growth strategy or reduce the value of the special dividend that we plan to declare and pay to shareholders following the sale of our wireless business to T-Mobile.\nWe may not be able to repay future indebtedness raised after the closing of the sale of our wireless operations.\nAs discussed in the Risks Related to our Business section above, we expect our capital expenditures to exceed the cash flow provided from continuing operations through 2023 as we invest in our network edge-out strategy. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in 2024 and beyond or to raise additional capital in amounts necessary for us to repay any future indebtedness when such indebtedness becomes due and to meet our other cash needs.\nOur level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and ability to compete.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $688.5 million of total indebtedness. Our level of indebtedness could have important adverse consequences. For example, it may:\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including interest rate increases, because as of December 31, 2020, a significant portion of our borrowings were, and may continue to be, subject to variable rates of interest;\n\u2022require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022limit our ability to borrow additional funds to alleviate liquidity constraints, as a result of financial and other restrictive covenants in our credit agreement;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies that have less indebtedness.", "PERMNO": 88742, "SIC": 4812, "TIC": "SHEN"}
