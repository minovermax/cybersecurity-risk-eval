{"cik": "771999", "company": "DOCUMENT SECURITY SYSTEMS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-06", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves risk. Before deciding whether to invest in our common stock, you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below. There may be other unknown or unpredictable economic, business, competitive, regulatory or other factors that could have material adverse effects on our future results. If any of these risks actually occurs, our business, business prospects, financial condition or results of operations could be seriously harmed. This could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, resulting in a loss of all or part of your investment. Please also read carefully the section contained in Part II, Item 7, below, entitled \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nWe have identified the following risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations in the future. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also significantly impair our business operations. If any of these risks occur, our business, results of operations or financial condition could suffer, the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common stock.\nWe have a history of losses.\nWe have a history of losses, including net losses for the fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015 of approximately $578,000, $950,000 and $14.3 million, respectively. Our results of operations in the future will depend on many factors, but largely on our ability to successfully market our anti-counterfeiting products, technologies and services and successfully monetize our IP assets. Failure to achieve profitability in the future could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our ability to raise additional capital and, accordingly, our ability to continue to grow our business. There can be no assurance that we will succeed in addressing any or all of these risks, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness, some of which is secured by our assets, and we may be unable to satisfy our obligations to pay interest and principal thereon when due or negotiate acceptable extensions or settlements.\nWe have outstanding indebtedness (described below), some of which is secured by our assets. Given our history of operating losses and our cash position, we may not be able to repay indebtedness when due. If we were to default on any of our other indebtedness that require payments of cash to settle such default and not receive an extension or a waiver from the creditor and the creditor were to foreclose on secured assets, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had the following significant amounts of outstanding indebtedness:\n(i) $50,000 promissory note secured by certain equipment and the assets of our wholly-owned subsidiary, Secuprint. The note, as amended on May 31, 2017, requires monthly principal payments of $15,000, plus interest at 10% per annum, with a maturity date of April 30, 2018 at which point the note is scheduled to be paid in full.\n(ii) $915,000 due under a promissory note with Citizens Bank used to purchase our packaging division facility. We are required to pay monthly installments of $7,658 plus interest until August 2021 at which time a balloon payment of the remaining principal balance will be due. We entered into an interest rate swap agreement to lock into a 5.87% effective interest rate over the life of the term loan. The promissory note is secured by a first mortgage on our packaging division facility.\n(iii) $325,000 due under a promissory note secured by certain equipment and the assets of our wholly-owned subsidiary, Secuprint. The note, as amended on May 31, 2017, requires monthly principal payments of $15,000, plus interest at 9% per annum. The note matures on December 31, 2018 at which point the note is scheduled to be paid in full.\n(iv) $287,000 under an equipment note entered into by our subsidiary, Premier Packaging, with Peoples Capital. The note is secured by the equipment, bears interest at 4.84%, and is repayable over a 60-month period in monthly payments of interest and principal of $24,511 which commenced in January 2014.\n(v) $345,000 under a promissory note entered into by our subsidiary, Premier Packaging, with Citizens Bank pursuant to which Premier Packaging made improvements and additions to its production facility. The promissory note is payable in monthly installments over a five-year period of $2,500 plus interest calculated at a variable rate of 1 Month Libor plus 3.15% (4.52% at December 31, 2017), which payments commenced on July 1, 2014. The note matures in July 2019 at which time a balloon payment of the remaining principal balance of $300,000 is due. The promissory note is secured by the assets of our packaging facility.\n(vi) $257,007, under a promissory note entered into by our subsidiary, Premier Packaging; with Citizens Bank pursuant to which Premier Packaging purchased a HP Indigo 7800 Digital press. The term note bears interest at 3.61% and is payable in 60 equal monthly installments of principal and interest of $9,591 until April 28, 2020.\n(vii) Up to $800,000 in a revolving line of credit with Citizens Bank available for use by Plastic Printing Professionals, subject to certain limitations, payable in monthly installments of interest only. Interest accrues at 1 Month LIBOR plus 2.00%. As of December 31, 2017, there was $522,000 outstanding under the line to fund the purchase of a used 6-color commercial press which is expected to be placed in service in the first quarter of 2018.\n(viii) An aggregate of $3,702,000 which includes accrued interest, outstanding under promissory notes and $459,000 outstanding under fixed return equity interests and contingent equity interests pursuant to an agreement with Fortress Credit Corp collateralized by certain of our semi-conductor patents, bearing interest at 1.95% payable in cash or in kind in our discretion. The notes are subject to various covenants and will also be subject to a Make Whole Amount calculation (as defined in the loan agreement), which will result in an effective annual interest rate of approximately 4.23% for the term thereof, assuming no prepayments. The notes matured on February 13, 2018.\nThe Citizens Bank obligations are secured by all of the assets of Premier Packaging and are also secured through cross guarantees by us and our other wholly-owned subsidiaries, P3 and Secuprint. Under the Citizens Bank credit facilities, our subsidiary, Premier Packaging Corporation is subject to various covenants including fixed charge coverage ratio, tangible net worth and current ratio covenants. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, Premier Packaging was in compliance with the covenants.\nThe Fortress agreement defines certain events of default, one of which was the failure by DSS Technology Management, on or before the second anniversary of the effective date, to make payments to the investors equal to the outstanding advances. On February 13, 2016, DSS Technology Management had failed to make these payments. Under the Agreement, upon an event of default, the collateral agent and the investors have a number of remedies, including rights related to foreclosure or direct monetization of the patents that secure the loan. On December 2, 2016, DSS Technology Management, the Company, the Collateral Agent and the Investors entered into a First Amendment to Investment Agreement which, among other amendments, vacated the Company\u2019s ongoing non-payment default under that agreement. On February 13, 2018, the Maturity Date, DSS Technology Management again defaulted by failing to pay the investors an amount equal to (x) two times the aggregate amount of all advances made by the investors as of such date plus (y) the Capitalized Expenses. The sole recourse available to the investors under the agreement is the establishment of a special purpose entity controlled by the investors which would take ownership of the collateral consisting of the patents covered under the agreement, as amended. Each of the investors and the collateral agent have contractually agreed that they will not, individually or collectively, seek to enforce any monetary judgment with respect to or against any assets of the Company other than the patents and the monetization payments and the remaining deposit. The Investors and the Collateral Agent have not taken any action as of the date of this Report to take ownership of the Collateral.\nWe cannot predict our future capital needs and we may not be able to secure additional financing.\nWe may need to raise additional funds in the future to fund our working capital needs and to continue our business. We also may need additional funds to complete development, testing and marketing of our products and technologies, or to make strategic acquisitions or investments. We may seek equity or debt financings, collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or funds from other sources for these purposes. No assurance can be given that necessary funds will be available for us to finance our development on acceptable terms, if at all. Furthermore, such additional financings may involve substantial dilution of our stockholders or may require that we relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or products. In addition, we may experience operational difficulties and delays due to working capital restrictions. If adequate funds are not available from operations or additional sources of financing, we may have to delay or scale back our growth plans or reduce or refocus our operations.\nThe value of our intangible assets and investments may not be equal to their carrying values.\nAs of December 31, 2017 we had approximately $3.7 million of net intangible assets, including goodwill. Approximately $1.2 million of this amount are intangible assets which derive their value from patents or patent rights, some of which are involved in litigation in order to derive licensing revenues, damages awards or settlements from infringers of the patents. If licensing efforts and litigation are not successful, the values of these assets could be reduced. We are required to evaluate the carrying value of such intangibles and goodwill and the fair value of investments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an intangible asset, including goodwill, and investment may not be recoverable. In the past, we have had to write down certain investments, some of which were significant. If any of our existing or future intangible assets, goodwill or investments are deemed to be impaired then it will result in a significant reduction of our operating results in such period.\nWe rely on two significant customers, the loss of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nDuring 2017, two customers accounted for 46% of our consolidated revenue. As of December 31, 2017, these two customers accounted for 38% of our trade accounts receivable balance. During 2016, these same two customers accounted for 38% of our consolidated revenue. As of December 31, 2016, these two customers accounted for 31% of our trade accounts receivable balance. The loss of either of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe have pending legal proceedings against numerous companies, and we expect such litigation to continue to be time-consuming and costly, which may adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to operate our business.\nTo monetize and protect our patent assets, we have commenced legal proceedings against numerous companies alleging infringement of our patents. Our viability as an operating company is partially dependent on the outcome of this litigation, and there is a risk that we may be unable to achieve the results we desire from such litigation, which failure could significantly harm our business. In addition, the defendants in this litigation are much larger than us and have substantially more resources than us, which could make our litigation efforts more difficult.\nThese legal proceedings may continue for several years and may require significant expenditures for legal fees and other expenses. Disputes regarding the assertion of patents and other intellectual property rights are highly complex and technical. Once initiated, we may be forced to litigate against others to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of other parties\u2019 proprietary rights. The defendants or other third parties involved in the lawsuits in which we are involved may allege defenses and/or file counterclaims in an effort to avoid or limit liability and damages for patent infringement. If such defenses or counterclaims are successful, they may have a great impact on the value of the patents and preclude our ability to derive licensing revenue from the patents. Therefore, a negative outcome of any such litigation, or one or more claims contained within any such litigation, could materially and adversely impact our business. The defendants may also seek reimbursement of court costs, legal fees and other expenses, which, if awarded, could be substantial and materially and adversely impact our cash positions.\nIn addition, certain of our patents are subject to security agreements with third parties that could cause the ownership of the patents to be transferred to such third-party in the event of default, which could result in the loss of value to the Company. As an example, our proceeds investment agreement with BKI is secured by certain of our LED patents.\nWhile we believe that certain of our patents are being infringed by the defendants named in our various litigation matters, there is a risk that a court will find the patents invalid, not infringed or unenforceable and/or that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, will either invalidate the patents or materially narrow the scope of their claims during the course of a re-examination or Inter Partes Review. In addition, even with a positive trial court verdict, the patents may be invalidated, found not infringed or rendered unenforceable on appeal. This risk may occur either presently in our current litigation or from time to time in connection with future litigation we may bring. If this were to occur, it would have a material adverse effect on our viability and operations.\nPatent litigation is inherently risky and the outcome is uncertain. Some of the parties we believe are infringing on our patents are large and well-financed companies with substantially greater resources than ours. We believe that parties will devote a substantial amount of resources in an attempt to avoid or limit a finding that they are liable for infringing our patents or, in the event liability is found, to avoid or limit the amount of associated damages. In addition, there is a risk that these parties may file re-examinations or other proceedings with the USPTO or other government agencies in an attempt to invalidate, narrow the scope or render unenforceable our patents. It is also possible that a court may rule that we have violated statutory authority, regulatory authority, federal rules, local court rules, or governing standards relating to the substantive or procedural aspects of such enforcement actions. In such event, a court may issue monetary sanctions against us or award attorneys\u2019 fees and/or expenses to one or more defendants, which could be material, and if we are required to pay such monetary sanctions, attorneys\u2019 fees and/or expenses, such payment could materially harm our operating results and our financial position.\nIn addition, it is difficult in general to predict the outcome of patent enforcement litigation at the trial level. There is a higher rate of appeals in patent enforcement litigation than more standard business litigation. Such appeals are expensive and time-consuming, and the outcomes of such appeals are sometimes unpredictable, resulting in increased costs and reduced or delayed revenue. We would expect any defendant in our patient enforcement litigation to appeal a trial court ruling against them, which would add to the expense and duration of the litigation and could result in a reversal of the trial court ruling.\nNew legislation, regulations or rules related to obtaining patents or enforcing patents could significantly increase our operating costs and decrease our revenue.\nWe expect to spend a significant amount of resources to enforce our patent assets. If new legislation, regulations or rules are implemented either by Congress, the USPTO, any state or the courts that impact the patent application process, the patent enforcement process or the rights of patent holders, these changes could negatively affect our expenses and revenue and any reductions in the funding of the USPTO could negatively impact the value of our assets. United States patent laws have been amended by the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act. The America Invents Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. In general, the legislation attempts to address issues surrounding the enforceability of patents and the increase in patent litigation by, among other things, establishing new procedures for patent litigation. For example, the America Invents Act changes the way that parties may be joined in patent infringement actions, increasing the likelihood that such actions will need to be brought against individual parties allegedly infringing by their respective individual actions or activities. The America Invents Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the enforcement of our patented technologies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nA number of states have adopted or are considering legislation to make the patent enforcement process more difficult for non-practicing entities, such as allowing such entities to be sued in state court and setting higher standards of proof for infringement claims. We cannot predict what, if any, impact these state initiatives will have on the operation of our enforcement business. However, such legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the enforcement of our patented technologies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nIn addition, the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, has conducted reviews of the patent system to evaluate the impact of patent assertion entities on industries in which those patents relate. It is possible that the findings and recommendations of the DOJ could impact the ability to effectively license and enforce standards-essential patents and could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the enforcement of any such patented technologies.\nFinally, new rules regarding the burden of proof in patent enforcement actions could significantly increase the cost of our enforcement actions, and new standards or limitations on liability for patent infringement could negatively impact any revenue we might derive from such enforcement actions.\nIf we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property, our competitive advantage may disappear.\nOur success will be determined in part by our ability to obtain United States and foreign patent protection for our technology and to preserve our trade secrets. Because of the substantial length of time and expense associated with developing new document security technology, we place considerable importance on patent and trade secret protection. We intend to continue to rely primarily on a combination of patent protection, trade secrets, technical measures, and nondisclosure agreements with our employees and customers to establish and protect the ideas, concepts and documentation of software and trade secrets developed by us. Our ability to compete and the ability of our business to grow could suffer if these intellectual property rights are not adequately protected. There can be no assurance that our patent applications will result in patents being issued or that current or additional patents will afford protection against competitors. Failure of our patents, trademarks and trade secret protection, non-disclosure agreements and other measures to provide protection of our technology and our intellectual property rights could enable our competitors to more effectively compete with us and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our trade secrets and proprietary know-how may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by others. No guarantee can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or techniques, or otherwise gain access to our proprietary technology.\nIn addition, we may be required to litigate in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Any such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, and there can be no assurances of the success of any such litigation.\nWe may face intellectual property infringement or other claims against us, our customers or our intellectual property that could be costly to defend and result in our loss of significant rights.\nAlthough we have received patents with respect to certain of our core business technologies, there can be no assurance that these patents will afford us any meaningful protection. Although we believe that our use of the technology and products we have developed and other trade secrets used in our operations do not infringe upon the rights of others, our use of the technology and trade secrets we developed may infringe upon the patents or intellectual property rights of others. In the event of infringement, we could, under certain circumstances, be required to obtain a license or modify aspects of the technology and trade secrets we developed or refrain from using the same. We may not have the necessary financial resources to defend an infringement claim made against us or be able to successfully terminate any infringement in a timely manner, upon acceptable terms and conditions or at all. Failure to do any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our operations and our financial condition. Moreover, if the patents, technology or trade secrets we developed or use in our business are deemed to infringe upon the rights of others, we could, under certain circumstances, become liable for damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and our financial condition. As we continue to market our products, we could encounter patent barriers that are not known today. A patent search may not disclose all related applications that are currently pending in the United States Patent Office, and there may be one or more such pending applications that would take precedence over any or all of our applications.\nFurthermore, third parties may assert that our intellectual property rights are invalid, which could result in significant expenditures by us to refute such assertions. If we become involved in litigation, we could lose our proprietary rights, be subject to damages and incur substantial unexpected operating expenses. Intellectual property litigation is expensive and time-consuming, even if the claims are subsequently proven unfounded, and could divert management\u2019s attention from our business. If there is a successful claim of infringement, we may not be able to develop non-infringing technology or enter into royalty or license agreements on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unsuccessful in defending claims that our intellectual property rights are invalid, we may not be able to enter into royalty or license agreements on acceptable terms, if at all. Moreover, if we are unsuccessful in our pending patent infringement litigation, we could lose certain patents that have been collateralized by third party funding partners. This could prohibit us from providing our products and services to customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and our financial condition.\nCertain of our recently developed products are not yet commercially accepted and there can be no assurance that those products will be accepted, which would adversely affect our financial results.\nOver the past several years, we have spent significant funds and time to create new products by applying its technologies onto media other than paper, including plastic and cardboard packaging, and delivery of our technologies digitally. We have had limited success to date in selling our products that are on cardboard packaging and those that are delivered digitally. Our business plan includes plans to incur significant marketing, intellectual property development and sales costs for these newer products, particularly the digitally delivered products. If we are not able to sell these new products, our financial results will be adversely affected.\nThe results of our research and development efforts are uncertain and there can be no assurance of the commercial success of our products.\nWe believe that we will need to continue to incur research and development expenditures to remain competitive. The products we are currently developing or may develop in the future may not be technologically successful. In addition, the length of our product development cycle may be greater than we originally expected and we may experience delays in future product development. If our resulting products are not technologically successful, they may not achieve market acceptance or compete effectively with our competitors\u2019 products.\nChanges in document security technology and standards could render our applications and services obsolete.\nThe market for document security products, applications, and services is fast moving and evolving. Identification and authentication technology is constantly changing as we and our competitors introduce new products, applications, and services, and retire old ones as customer requirements quickly develop and change. In addition, the standards for document security are continuing to evolve. If any segments of our market adopt technologies or standards that are inconsistent with our applications and technology, sales to that market segments could decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and our financial condition.\nThe market in which we operate is highly competitive, and we may not be able to compete effectively, especially against established industry competitors with greater market presence and financial resources.\nOur market is highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change and product innovations. Our competitors may have advantages over us because of their longer operating histories, more established products, greater name recognition, larger customer bases, and greater financial, technical and marketing resources. As a result, they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, and devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products. Competition may also force us to decrease the price of our products and services. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in developing and introducing new technology on a timely basis, new products with enhanced features, or that these products, if introduced, will enable us to establish selling prices and gross margins at profitable levels.\nIf we are unable to respond to regulatory or industry standards effectively, our growth and development could be delayed or limited.\nOur future success will depend in part on our ability to enhance and improve the functionality and features of our products and services in accordance with regulatory or industry standards. Our ability to compete effectively will depend in part on our ability to influence and respond to emerging industry governmental standards in a timely and cost-effective manner. If we are unable to influence these or other standards or respond to these or other standards effectively, our growth and development of various products and services could be delayed or limited.\nIf we do not successfully expand our sales force, we may be unable to increase our revenues.\nWe must expand the size of our marketing activities and sales force to increase revenues. We continue to evaluate various methods of expanding our marketing activities, including the use of outside marketing consultants and representatives and expanding our in-house marketing capabilities. If we are unable to hire or retain qualified sales personnel or if newly hired personnel fail to develop the necessary skills to be productive, or if they reach productivity more slowly than anticipated, our ability to increase our revenues and grow could be compromised. The challenge of attracting, training and retaining qualified candidates may make it difficult to meet our sales growth targets. Further, we may not generate sufficient sales to offset the increased expense resulting from expanding our sales force or we may be unable to manage a larger sales force.\nIf we fail to retain certain of our key personnel and attract and retain additional qualified personnel, we might not be able to remain competitive, continue to expand our technology or pursue growth.\nOur future success depends upon the continued service of certain of our executive officers and other key sales and research personnel who possess longstanding industry relationships and technical knowledge of our products and operations. Although we believe that our relationship with these individuals is positive, there can be no assurance that the services of these individuals will continue to be available to us in the future. There can be no assurance that these persons will agree to continue to be employed by us after the expiration dates of their current contracts.\nWe may be unable to retain experts and legal counsel on a favorable basis to represent us in our patent infringement litigation.\nThe success of our pending legal proceedings and future legal proceedings depends in part upon our ability to retain experts and legal counsel on a favorable basis to represent us in such litigation. The retention of such experts and legal counsel is expensive and we may not be able to retain such experts and legal counsel on favorable economic terms. Therefore, an inability to retain experts and legal counsel to represent us in our litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFuture growth in our business could make it difficult to manage our resources.\nFuture business expansion could place a significant strain on our management, administrative and financial resources. Significant growth in our business may require us to implement additional operating, product development and financial controls, improve coordination among marketing, product development and finance functions, increase capital expenditures and hire additional personnel. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully manage any substantial expansion of our business, including attracting and retaining qualified personnel. Any failure to properly manage our future growth could negatively impact our business and operating results.\nWe have identified weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting structure; any material weaknesses may cause errors in our financial statements that could require restatements of our financial statements and investors may lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could lead to a decline in our stock price.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires us to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each year, and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in each Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have and had previously identified weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting following management\u2019s annual assessment of internal controls over financial reporting and, as a result of that assessment, management has concluded this year that we did not maintain a sufficient complement of qualified accounting personnel and controls associated with segregation of duties, and that the foregoing represented material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. If our internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures are not effective in the future, there may be errors in our financial statements and in our disclosure that could require restatements. Investors may lose confidence in our reported financial information and in our disclosure, which could lead to a decline in our stock price.\nWe have a large number of authorized but unissued shares of common stock, which our management may issue without further stockholder approval, thereby causing dilution of your holdings of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 183 million authorized but unissued shares of our common stock. Our management continues to have broad discretion to issue shares of our common stock in a range of transactions, including capital-raising transactions, mergers, acquisitions, for anti-takeover purposes, and in other transactions, without obtaining stockholder approval, unless stockholder approval is required for a particular transaction under the rules of the NYSE American LLC Exchange (\u201cNYSE American\u201d), state and federal law, or other applicable laws. If our board of directors determines to issue additional shares of our common stock from the large pool of authorized but unissued shares for any purpose in the future with or without obtaining stockholder approval, your ownership position would be diluted without your ability to vote on such transaction.\nThe exercise of our outstanding options and warrants, vesting of restricted stock awards and conversion of debt securities may depress our stock price.\nAs of December 31, 2017, there were 3,177,759 of common stock share equivalents potentially issuable under convertible debt agreements, employment agreements, options, warrants, and restricted stock agreements that could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the future. The prospect of the issuance of shares of common stock upon the conversion, exercise or vesting of these securities in the public market, or the perception that future sales of the common stock underlying these securities could occur, could have the effect of lowering the market price of our common stock below current levels and make it more difficult for us and our stockholders to sell our equity securities in the future. Sales or the availability for sale of shares of common stock by stockholders, including upon conversion, exercise or vesting of any outstanding derivative or restricted securities, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline and could impair our ability to raise capital through an offering of additional equity securities.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends.\nWe do not intend to declare or pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will retain any earnings and other cash resources for investment in our business. The payment of dividends on our common stock is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our operations, financial position, financial requirements, general business conditions, restrictions imposed by financing arrangements, if any, legal restrictions on the payment of dividends and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant.\nWe may seek to internally develop additional new inventions and intellectual property, which would take time and would be costly. Moreover, the failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights for such inventions would lead to the loss of our investments in such activities.\nMembers of our management team have significant experience as inventors. As such, part of our business may include the internal development of new inventions and intellectual property that we would seek to monetize. However, this aspect of our business would likely require significant capital and would take time to achieve. Such activities could also distract our management team from our present business initiatives, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business. There is also the risk that these initiatives would not yield any viable new inventions or technology, which would lead to a loss our investments in time and resources in such activities.\nIn addition, even if we are able to internally develop new inventions, in order for those inventions to be viable and to compete effectively, we would need to develop and maintain, and we would heavily rely on, a proprietary position with respect to such inventions and intellectual property. However, there are significant risks associated with any such intellectual property we may develop principally including the following:\n\u25cf patent applications we may file may not result in issued patents or may take longer than we expect to result in issued patents;\n\u25cf we may be subject to interference proceedings;\n\u25cf we may be subject to opposition proceedings in the U.S. or foreign countries;\n\u25cf any patents that are issued to us may not provide meaningful protection;\n\u25cf we may not be able to develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;\n\u25cf other companies may challenge patents issued to us;\n\u25cf other companies may design around technologies we have developed; and\n\u25cf enforcement of our patents may be complex, uncertain and very expensive.\nWe cannot be certain that patents will be issued as a result of any future applications, or that any of our patents, once issued, will provide us with adequate protection from competing products. For example, issued patents may be circumvented or challenged, declared invalid or unenforceable, or narrowed in scope. In addition, since publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that it will be the first to make our additional new inventions or to file patent applications covering those inventions. It is also possible that others may have or may obtain issued patents that could prevent us from commercializing our products or require us to obtain licenses requiring the payment of significant fees or royalties in order to enable us to conduct our business. As to those patents that we may license or otherwise monetize, our rights will depend on maintaining our obligations to the licensor under the applicable license agreement, and we may be unable to do so. Our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights for our inventions would lead to the loss of our investments in such activities, which would have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nMoreover, patent application delays could cause delays in recognizing revenue from our internally generated patents and could cause us to miss opportunities to license patents before other competing technologies are developed or introduced into the market.\nChanges in the laws and regulations to which we are subject may increase our costs.\nWe are subject to numerous laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, environmental and health and welfare benefit regulations, as well as those associated with being a public company. These rules and regulations may be changed by local, state, provincial, national or foreign governments or agencies. Such changes may result in significant increases in our compliance costs. Compliance with changes in rules and regulations could require increases to our workforce, and could result in increased costs for services, compensation and benefits, and investment in new or upgraded equipment.\nOur acquisitions of patent assets may be time consuming, complex and costly, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nAcquisitions of patent or other intellectual property assets, which may continue to be part of our business plan, are often-times consuming, complex and costly to consummate. We may utilize many different transaction structures in our acquisitions and the terms of such acquisition agreements tend to be heavily negotiated. As a result, we would expect to incur significant operating expenses and would likely be required to raise capital during the negotiations even if the acquisition were ultimately not consummated. Even if we were able to acquire particular patent assets, there is no guarantee that we would generate sufficient revenue related to those patent assets to offset the acquisition costs. While we would seek to conduct confirmatory due diligence on any patent assets we consider for acquisition, we may acquire patent assets from a seller who does not have proper title to those assets. In those cases, we could be required to spend significant resources to defend our interest in the patent assets and, if we were not successful, our acquisition may be invalid, in which case we could lose part or all of our investment in the assets.\nIn addition, we may acquire patents and technologies that are in the early stages of adoption in the commercial, industrial and consumer markets. Demand for some of these technologies will likely be untested and may be subject to fluctuation based upon the rate at which licensees will adopt these patents and technologies in their products and services. As a result, there can be no assurance as to whether technologies we acquire or develop will have value that we can monetize.\nIn certain acquisitions of patent assets, we may seek to defer payment or finance a portion of the acquisition price. This approach may put us at a competitive disadvantage and could result in harm to our business.\nWe have limited capital and may seek to negotiate acquisitions of patent or other intellectual property assets where we can defer payments or finance a portion of the acquisition price. These types of debt financing or deferred payment arrangements may not be as attractive to sellers of patent assets as receiving the full purchase price for those assets in cash at the closing of the acquisition. Moreover, funding by third parties for patent acquisitions may not be available to us in the future. As a result, we might not compete effectively against other companies in the market for acquiring patent assets, many of whom have greater cash resources than we have.\nWe may not be able to capitalize on potential market opportunities related to our licensing strategy or patent portfolio for our core business.\nIn order to capitalize on our core business patent portfolio, we intend to enter into licensing relationships. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to capitalize on our patent portfolio or any potential market opportunity in the foreseeable future. Our inability to generate licensing revenues associated with potential market opportunities could result from a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf failure to enter into licensing relationships on commercially acceptable terms, or at all; and\n\u25cf challenges from third parties as to the validity of our patents underlying licensing opportunities.\nWeak global economic conditions may cause infringing parties to delay entering into licensing agreements, which could prolong our litigation and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nOur business plan may be affected by worldwide economic conditions, and the United States and world economies have recently experienced and in some areas continue to experience prolonged weak economic conditions. Uncertainty about global economic conditions poses a risk as businesses may postpone spending in response to tighter credit, negative financial news and declines in income or asset values. This response could have a material negative effect on the willingness of parties infringing on our assets to enter into licensing or other revenue generating agreements voluntarily. Entering into such agreements is critical to our business plan, and failure to do so could cause material harm to our business.\nDeclines in general economic conditions or acts of war and terrorism may adversely impact our business.\nDemand for printing services is typically correlated with general economic conditions. The prolonged decline in United States economic conditions associated with the great recession adversely impacted our business and results of operations, and may do so again. The overall business climate of our industry may also be impacted by domestic and foreign wars or acts of terrorism, which events may have sudden and unpredictable adverse impacts on demand for our products and services.\nIf we fail to comply with the continued listing standards of the NYSE American LLC Exchange, it may result in a delisting of our common stock from the exchange.\nOur common stock is currently listed for trading on the NYSE American LLC Exchange (formerly NYSE MKT LLC), and the continued listing of our common stock on the NYSE American LLC Exchange (\u201cNYSE American\u201d) is subject to our compliance with a number of listing standards. On March 15, 2016, we were notified by the NYSE American that we were not in compliance with the continued listing standards set forth in Section 1003(f)(v) of the NYSE American LLC Company Guide (the \u201cCompany Guide\u201d), which addresses Low Selling Price Issues. The NYSE American stated in its notice that the most recent 30-day average selling price per share of $0.16 fell below the acceptable minimum required average share price for continued listing under Section 1003(f)(v) of the Company Guide, and that our stock had been closing at or below $0.20 per share since December 11, 2015. The NYSE American does not provide a specific minimum average price per share in its rules for purposes of compliance with Section 1003(f)(v) of the Company Guide, but instead makes those determinations in its discretion, on a case by case basis. Under NYSE American\u2019s rules, we had six months following receipt of notification to regain compliance with the minimum share price requirement. At the suggestion of NYSE Regulation, we affected a 1-for-4 reverse stock split on August 26, 2016. Thereafter, on September 15, 2016, we received a letter from NYSE Regulation notifying us that we were back in compliance with respect to Section 1003(f)(v) of the Company Guide. On April 1, 2016, we were notified by the NYSE American that we were not in compliance with the stockholders\u2019 equity continued listing standards set forth in Section 1003(a)(ii) of the Company Guide. In order to maintain our NYSE American listing, we were required to submit a plan of compliance by May 2, 2016 addressing how we intend to regain compliance with Section 1003(a)(ii) of the Company Guide by October 2, 2017. We complied with this request, and on May 19, 2016, we received notification from the NYSE American that NYSE Regulation had accepted our plan to regain compliance with the exchange\u2019s continued listing standards set forth in Section 1003(a)(ii) of the Company Guide by October 2, 2017, subject to periodic review by NYSE American for compliance with the initiatives set forth in the plan. On October 2, 2017, the Company was formally notified by the NYSE American that the Company had regained compliance with the stockholders\u2019 equity continued listing standards set forth in Section 1003(a)(ii) of the Company Guide and will be permitted to continue to list its common stock for trading on the NYSE American exchange under the symbol \u201cDSS\u201d. However, there can be no assurance that we will continue to meet the continued listing standards of the NYSE American in the future.\nIf we are delisted from the NYSE American, your ability to sell your shares of our common stock may be limited by the penny stock restrictions, which could further limit the marketability of your shares.\nIf our common stock is delisted from the NYSE American, it could come within the definition of a \u201cpenny stock\u201d as defined in the Exchange Act and could be covered by Rule 15g-9 of the Exchange Act. That rule imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. For transactions covered by Rule 15g-9, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction prior to the sale. Consequently, Rule 15g-9, if it were to become applicable, would affect the ability or willingness of broker-dealers to sell our securities, and accordingly would affect the ability of stockholders to sell their securities in the public market. These additional procedures could also limit our ability to raise additional capital in the future.\nIf our common stock is not listed on a national securities exchange, compliance with applicable state securities laws may be required for certain offers, transfers and sales of the shares of our common stock.\nBecause our common stock is listed on the NYSE American, we are not required to register or qualify in any state the offer, transfer or sale of the common stock. If our common stock is delisted from the NYSE American and is not eligible to be listed on another national securities exchange, sales of stock pursuant to the exercise of warrants and transfers of the shares of our common stock sold by us in private placements to U.S. holders may not be exempt from state securities laws. In such event, it will be the responsibility of us in the case of warrant exercises or the holder of privately placed shares to register or qualify the shares for any offer, transfer or sale in the United States or to determine that any such offer, transfer or sale is exempt under applicable state securities laws.\nThere is no public market for the warrants we issued in the Fall of 2015.\nThere is no established public trading market for the warrants we issued in the Fall of 2015, and we do not expect a market to develop. In addition, we do not intend to apply for listing of those warrants on any national securities exchange or other nationally recognized trading system. Without an active market, the liquidity of those warrants will be limited.", "PERMNO": 10253, "SIC": 7373, "TIC": "DSS"}
