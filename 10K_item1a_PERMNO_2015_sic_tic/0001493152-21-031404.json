The COVID-19 pandemic, federal, state and local government responses to COVID-19, our customers\u2019 responses to the pandemic, and our Company\u2019s responses to the pandemic have all disrupted and will continue to disrupt our business. In the United States, as well as globally, individuals are being encouraged to practice social distancing, restricted from gathering in groups and, in some areas, placed on complete restriction from non-essential movements outside of their homes. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and these changing conditions, we temporarily closed all of our clubs and restaurants on March 18, 2020. We furloughed club and restaurant employees, except for a limited number of unit managers, and implemented cost savings measures throughout our operations. We have since reopened many of our club and Bombshells locations with certain operating hour restrictions and with limited occupancy. The COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s impact on the economy in general could also adversely affect our customers\u2019 financial condition, resulting in reduced spending at our clubs and restaurants. The COVID-19 pandemic and these responses have affected and will continue to adversely affect our customer traffic, sales and operating costs and we cannot predict how long the pandemic will last or what other government responses may occur.\nIf the business interruptions caused by COVID-19 last longer than we expect, we may need to seek other sources of liquidity. The COVID-19 pandemic is adversely affecting the availability of liquidity generally in the credit markets, and there can be no guarantee that additional liquidity will be readily available or available on favorable terms.\nOur club and restaurant operations could be further disrupted if any of our employees are diagnosed with COVID-19 and the circumstances require quarantine of some or all of a club or restaurant\u2019s employees and disinfection of the facilities. If a significant percentage of our workforce is unable to work, whether because of illness, quarantine, limitations on travel or other government restrictions in connection with COVID-19, our operations may be negatively impacted, potentially materially adversely affecting our liquidity, financial condition or results of operations. Those employees might seek and find other employment during our business interruption, which could materially adversely affect our ability to properly staff and reopen our clubs and restaurants with experienced team members when permitted to do so by governments.\nOur suppliers could be adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. If our suppliers\u2019 employees are unable to work, whether because of illness, quarantine, limitations on travel or other government restrictions in connection with COVID-19, we could face shortages of food items or other supplies at our restaurants and our operations and sales could be adversely impacted by such supply interruptions.\nThe equity markets in the United States have been extremely volatile due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the Company\u2019s stock price has fluctuated significantly.\nIf we are unable to maintain compliance with certain of our debt covenants or unable to obtain waivers, we may be unable to make additional borrowings and be declared in default where our debt will be made immediately due and payable. In addition, global economic conditions may make it more difficult to access new credit facilities.\nOur liquidity position is, in part, dependent upon our ability to borrow funds from financial institutions and/or private individuals. Certain of our debts have financial covenants that require us to maintain certain operating income to debt service ratios. As of September 30, 2021, we were in compliance with all covenants. However, as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, our total revenues decreased significantly (although they have since recovered), and we have implemented certain operational changes in order to address the evolving challenges presented by the global pandemic on our operations. Due to the impact of COVID-19, our financial performance in future fiscal quarters will be negatively impacted. A failure to comply with the financial covenants under our credit facility or obtain waivers would give rise to an event of default under the terms of certain of our debts, allowing the lenders to accelerate repayment of any outstanding debt.\nWe have recorded impairment charges in current and past periods and may record additional impairment charges in future periods.\nOur nightclubs are often acquired with a purchase price based on historical EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization). This results in certain nightclubs carrying a substantial amount of intangible asset value, mostly allocated to licenses and goodwill. Generally accepted accounting principles require periodic impairment review of indefinite-lived intangible assets, long-lived assets, and goodwill to determine if, or when events and circumstances indicate that, the fair value of these assets is not recoverable. As a result of our periodic impairment reviews, we recorded impairment charges of $13.6 million in 2021 (representing $6.3 million goodwill impairment on seven clubs, $5.3 million SOB license impairment on three clubs, and $2.0 million property and equipment impairment on four clubs and one held-for-sale property); $10.6 million in 2020 (representing $7.9 million goodwill impairment on seven club reporting units, $2.3 million of license impairment on two clubs, $302,000 property and equipment impairment on one club and one Bombshells, and $104,000 of operating lease right-of-use asset impairment on one club); and $6.0 million in 2019 (representing $4.2 million property and equipment impairment on two clubs, $1.6 million goodwill impairment on four clubs, and $178,000 of license impairment on one club). A huge portion, if not all, of the impairments in 2021 and 2020 related to the projected decline in EBITDA caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. If difficult market and economic conditions materialize over the next year and/or we experience a decrease in revenue at one or more nightclubs or restaurants, we could incur a decline in fair value of one or more of our nightclubs or restaurants. This could result in future impairment charges of up to the total value of our tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill. We actively monitor our clubs and restaurants for any indication of impairment.\nRisks related to regulations and/or regulatory agencies\nOur business operations are subject to regulatory uncertainties which may affect our ability to continue operations of existing nightclubs, acquire additional nightclubs, or be profitable.\nAdult entertainment nightclubs are subject to local, state and federal regulations. Our business is regulated by local zoning, local and state liquor licensing, local ordinances, and state and federal time place and manner restrictions. The adult entertainment provided by our nightclubs has elements of speech and expression and, therefore, enjoys some protection under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. However, the protection is limited to the expression, and not the conduct of an entertainer. While our nightclubs are generally well established in their respective markets, there can be no assurance that local, state and/or federal licensing and other regulations will permit our nightclubs to remain in operation or profitable in the future.\nThe adult entertainment industry standard is to classify adult entertainers as independent contractors, not employees. If federal or state law mandates that they be classified as employees, our business could be adversely impacted.\nThe adult entertainment industry standard is to classify adult entertainers as independent contractors, not employees. The Internal Revenue Service regulations and applicable state law guidelines regarding independent contractor classification are subject to judicial and agency interpretation, and it could be determined that the independent contractor classification is inapplicable. Further, if legal standards for classification of independent contractors change, it may be necessary to modify our compensation structure for these adult entertainers, including by paying additional compensation or reimbursing expenses. While we take steps to ensure that our adult entertainers are deemed independent contractors, if our adult entertainers are determined to have been misclassified as independent contractors, we would incur additional exposure under federal and state law, workers\u2019 compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, employment and tort laws, including for prior periods, as well as potential liability for employee benefits and tax withholdings. Any of these outcomes could result in substantial costs to us, could significantly impair our financial condition and our ability to conduct our business as we choose, and could damage our ability to attract and retain other personnel.\nOur revenues could be significantly affected by limitations relating to permits to sell alcoholic beverages.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from the sale of alcoholic beverages. States in which we operate may have laws which may limit the availability of a permit to sell alcoholic beverages, or which may provide for suspension or revocation of a permit to sell alcoholic beverages in certain circumstances. The temporary or permanent suspension or revocations of any such permits would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, financial condition and results of operations. In all states where we operate, management believes we are in compliance with applicable city, county, state or other local laws governing the sale of alcohol.\nActivities or conduct at our nightclubs may cause us to lose necessary business licenses, expose us to liability, or result in adverse publicity, which may increase our costs and divert management\u2019s attention from our business.\nWe are subject to risks associated with activities or conduct at our nightclubs that are illegal or violate the terms of necessary business licenses. Some of our nightclubs operate under licenses for sexually oriented businesses and are afforded some protection under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. While we believe that the activities at our nightclubs comply with the terms of such licenses, and that the element of our business that constitutes an expression of free speech under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution is protected, activities and conduct at our nightclubs may be found to violate the terms of such licenses or be unprotected under the U.S. Constitution. This protection is limited to the expression and not the conduct of an entertainer. An issuing authority may suspend or terminate a license for a nightclub found to have violated the license terms. Illegal activities or conduct at any of our nightclubs may result in negative publicity or litigation. Such consequences may increase our cost of doing business, divert management\u2019s attention from our business and make an investment in our securities unattractive to current and potential investors, thereby lowering our profitability and our stock price.\nWe have developed comprehensive policies aimed at ensuring that the operation of each of our nightclubs is conducted in conformance with local, state and federal laws. We have a \u201cno tolerance\u201d policy on illegal drug use in or around our facilities. We continually monitor the actions of entertainers, waitresses and customers to ensure that proper behavior standards are met. However, such policies, no matter how well designed and enforced, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the policies\u2019 objectives are being achieved. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems and policies, there can be no assurance that our policies will prevent deliberate acts by persons attempting to violate or circumvent them. Notwithstanding the foregoing limitations, management believes that our policies are reasonably effective in achieving their purposes.\nRisks related to our business\nWe may deviate from our present capital allocation strategy.\nWe believe that our present capital allocation strategy will provide us with optimized returns. However, implementation of our capital allocation strategy depends on the interplay of several factors such as our stock price, our outstanding common shares, the interest rates on our debt, and the rate of return on available investments. If these factors are not conducive to implementing our present capital allocation strategy, or we determine that adopting a different capital allocation strategy is in the best interest of shareholders, we reserve the right to deviate from this approach. There can be no assurance that we will not deviate from or adopt an alternative capital allocation strategy moving forward.\nWe may need additional financing, or our business expansion plans may be significantly limited.\nIf cash generated from our operations is insufficient to satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements, we will need to raise additional funds through the public or private sale of our equity or debt securities. The timing and amount of our capital requirements will depend on a number of factors, including cash flow and cash requirements for nightclub acquisitions and new restaurant development. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership percentage of our then-existing shareholders will be diluted. We cannot ensure that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us, if at all. Any future equity financing, if available, may result in dilution to existing shareholders; and debt financing, if available, may include restrictive covenants. Any failure by us to procure timely additional financing, if needed, will have material adverse consequences on our business operations.\nThere is substantial competition in the nightclub entertainment industry, which may affect our ability to operate profitably or acquire additional clubs.\nOur nightclubs face substantial competition. Some of our competitors may have greater financial and management resources than we do. Additionally, the industry is subject to unpredictable competitive trends and competition for general entertainment dollars. There can be no assurance that we will be able to remain profitable in this competitive industry.\nThe adult entertainment industry is extremely volatile.\nHistorically, the adult entertainment, restaurant and bar industry has been an extremely volatile industry. The industry tends to be extremely sensitive to the general local economy, in that when economic conditions are prosperous, adult entertainment industry revenues increase, and when economic conditions are unfavorable, entertainment industry revenues decline. Coupled with this economic sensitivity are the trendy personal preferences of the customers who frequent adult cabarets. We continuously monitor trends in our customers\u2019 tastes and entertainment preferences so that, if necessary, we can make appropriate changes which will allow us to remain one of the premiere adult cabarets. However, any significant decline in general corporate conditions or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects that affect consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, we have historically catered to a clientele base from the upper end of the market. Accordingly, further reductions in the amounts of entertainment expenses allowed as deductions from income under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, could adversely affect sales to customers dependent upon corporate expense accounts.\nPrivate advocacy group actions targeted at the kind of adult entertainment we offer could result in limitations in our inability to operate in certain locations and negatively impact our business.\nOur ability to operate successfully depends on the protection provided to us under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. From time to time, private advocacy groups have sought to target our nightclubs by petitioning for non-renewal of certain of our permits and licenses. Furthermore, private advocacy groups which have influences on certain financial institutions have managed to sway these financial institutions into not doing business with us. In addition to possibly limiting our operations and financing options, negative publicity campaigns, lawsuits and boycotts could negatively affect our businesses and cause additional financial harm by discouraging investors from investing in our securities or requiring that we incur significant expenditures to defend our business.\nWe rely heavily on information technology in our operations and any material failure, weakness, interruption, or breach of security could prevent us from effectively operating our business.\nOur operations and corporate functions rely heavily on information systems, including point-of-sale processing, management of our supply chain, payment of obligations, collection of cash, electronic communications, data warehousing to support analytics, finance and accounting systems, mobile technologies to enhance the customer experience, and other various processes and procedures, some of which are handled by third parties. Our ability to efficiently and effectively manage our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, maintenance problems, upgrading or transitioning to new platforms, or a breach in security relating to these systems could result in delays in consumer service and reduce efficiency in our operations. These problems could adversely affect our results of operations, and remediation could result in significant, unplanned capital investments.\nSecurity breaches of confidential customer information or personal employee information may adversely affect our business.\nA significant portion of our revenues are paid through debit and credit cards. Other restaurants and retailers have experienced significant security breaches in which debit and credit card information or other personal information of their customers have been stolen. We also maintain certain personal information regarding our employees. Although we aim to safeguard our technology systems, they could potentially be vulnerable to damage, disability or failures due to physical theft, fire, power outage, telecommunication failure or other catastrophic events, as well as from internal and external security breaches, employee error or malfeasance, denial of service attacks, viruses, worms and other disruptive problems caused by hackers and cyber criminals. A breach in our systems that compromises the information of our customers or employees could result in widespread negative publicity, damage to our reputation, a loss of customers, and legal liabilities. We may in the future become subject to lawsuits or other proceedings for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising from the actual or alleged theft of our customers\u2019 debit and credit card information or if customer or employee information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately. Any such claim or proceeding, or any adverse publicity resulting from such an event, may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur acquisitions may result in disruptions in our business and diversion of management\u2019s attention.\nWe have made and may continue to make acquisitions of complementary nightclubs, restaurants or related operations. Any acquisitions will require the integration of the operations, products and personnel of the acquired businesses and the training and motivation of these individuals. Such acquisitions may disrupt our operations and divert management\u2019s attention from day-to-day operations, which could impair our relationships with current employees, customers and partners. We may also incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions. These issuances could be substantially dilutive to our stockholders. In addition, our profitability may suffer because of acquisition-related costs or amortization, or impairment costs for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets. If management is unable to fully integrate acquired business, products or persons with existing operations, we may not receive the benefits of the acquisitions, and our revenues and stock trading price may decrease.\nWe face a variety of risks associated with doing business with franchisees and licensees.\nWe have started franchising Bombshells. We believe that we have selected highly competent operating partners and franchisees with significant experience in restaurant operations, and we are providing them training and support on the Bombshells brand. However, the probability of opening, ultimate success and quality of any franchise or licensed restaurant rests principally with the franchisee. If the franchisee does not successfully open and operate its restaurants in a manner consistent with our standards, or if guests have negative experiences due to issues with food quality or operational execution, our brand value could suffer, which could have an adverse impact on our business.\nThe impact of new club or restaurant openings could result in fluctuations in our financial performance.\nPerformance of any new club or restaurant location will usually differ from its originally targeted performance due to a variety of factors, and these differences may be material. New clubs and restaurants typically encounter higher customer traffic and sales in their initial months, which may decrease over time. Accordingly, sales achieved by new or reconcepted locations may not be indicative of future operating results. Additionally, we incur substantial pre-opening expenses each time we open a new establishment, which expenses may be higher than anticipated. Due to the foregoing factors, results for any one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other fiscal quarter or for a full fiscal year.\nOur ability to grow sales through delivery orders is uncertain.\nPart of our strategy for restaurant growth is dependent on increased sales from guests that want our food delivered to them. We currently rely on third-party delivery providers for the ordering and payment platforms that receive guest orders and that send orders directly to our point-of-sale system. These platforms could be damaged or interrupted by technological failures, cyber-attacks, or other factors, which may adversely impact our sales through these channels.\nDelivery providers generally fulfill delivery orders through drivers that are independent contractors. These drivers may make errors, fail to make timely deliveries, damage our food, or poorly represent our brands, which may lead to customer disappointment, reputational harm and unmet sales expectations. Our sales may also be adversely impacted if there is a shortage of drivers that are willing and available to make deliveries from our restaurants. We also incur additional costs associated with delivery orders, and it is possible that these orders could cannibalize more profitable in-restaurant visits or take-out orders.\nWe incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management devotes substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\nWe incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that our non-public competition does not incur. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), as well as new rules subsequently implemented by the SEC, have imposed various requirements on public companies, including requiring certain corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly.\nIn addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and effective disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we are required to perform system and process evaluation and testing on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, and our independent registered public accounting firm is required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In performing this evaluation and testing, both our management and our independent registered public accounting firm concluded that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as of September 30, 2021 because of a material weakness. We are, however, addressing this issue and remediating our material weakness. Upon finalizing the remediation of this material weakness, we believe our internal control will be deemed effective. Correcting this issue, and thereafter our continued compliance with Section 404 will require that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. Moreover, if we are not able to correct our internal control issues and comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, or if in the future we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2021 and concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting. Specifically, management identified a material weakness over the impairment of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangibles and long-lived assets, specifically over the precision of management\u2019s review of certain assumptions-see Item 9A, \u201cControls and Procedures,\u201d below. While certain actions have been taken to implement a remediation plan to address this material weakness and to enhance our internal control over financial reporting, if this material weakness is not remediated, it could adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations in a timely and accurate manner, which could negatively affect investor confidence in our company, and, as a result, the value of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nWe may have uninsured risks in excess of our insurance coverage.\nWe maintain insurance in amounts we consider adequate for personal injury and property damage to which the business of the Company may be subject. However, there can be no assurance that uninsured liabilities in excess of the coverage provided by insurance, which liabilities may be imposed pursuant to the Texas \u201cdram shop\u201d statute or similar \u201cdram shop\u201d statutes or common law theories of liability in other states where we operate or expand. For example, the Texas \u201cdram shop\u201d statute provides a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to such person if it was apparent to the server that the individual being sold, served or provided with an alcoholic beverage was obviously intoxicated to the extent that he presented a clear danger to himself and others. An employer is not liable for the actions of its employee who over-serves if (i) the employer requires its employees to attend a seller training program approved by the TABC; (ii) the employee has actually attended such a training program; and (iii) the employer has not directly or indirectly encouraged the employee to violate the law. It is our policy to require that all servers of alcohol working at our clubs in Texas be certified as servers under a training program approved by the TABC, which certification gives statutory immunity to the sellers of alcohol from damage caused to third parties by those who have consumed alcoholic beverages at such establishment pursuant to the TABC. There can be no assurance, however, that uninsured liabilities may not arise in the markets in which we operate which could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nOur previous liability insurer may be unable to provide coverage to us and our subsidiaries.\nAs previously reported, the Company and its subsidiaries were insured under a liability policy issued by Indemnity Insurance Corporation, RRG (\u201cIIC\u201d) through October 25, 2013. The Company and its subsidiaries changed insurance companies on that date.\nOn November 7, 2013, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware entered a Rehabilitation and Injunction Order (\u201cRehabilitation Order\u201d), which declared IIC impaired, insolvent and in an unsafe condition and placed IIC under the supervision of the Insurance Commissioner of the State of Delaware (\u201cCommissioner\u201d) in her capacity as receiver (\u201cReceiver\u201d). The Rehabilitation Order empowered the Commissioner to rehabilitate IIC through a variety of means, including gathering assets and marshaling those assets, as necessary. Further, the order stayed or abated pending lawsuits involving IIC as the insurer until May 6, 2014.\nOn April 10, 2014, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware entered a Liquidation and Injunction Order With Bar Date (\u201cLiquidation Order\u201d), which ordered the liquidation of IIC and terminated all insurance policies or contracts of insurance issued by IIC. The Liquidation Order further ordered that all claims against IIC must have been filed with the Receiver before the close of business on January 16, 2015 and that all pending lawsuits involving IIC as the insurer were further stayed or abated until October 7, 2014. As a result, the Company and its subsidiaries no longer had insurance coverage under the liability policy with IIC. The Company has retained counsel to defend against and evaluate these claims and lawsuits. We are funding 100% of the costs of litigation and will seek reimbursement from the bankruptcy receiver. The Company filed the appropriate claims against IIC with the Receiver before the January 16, 2015 deadline and has provided updates as requested; however, there are no assurances of any recovery from these claims. It is unknown at this time what effect this uncertainty will have on the Company. As previously stated, since October 25, 2013, the Company obtained general liability coverage from other insurers, which have covered and/or will cover any claims arising from actions after that date. As of September 30, 2021, we had 2 remaining unresolved claims out of the original 71 claims. One of the two remaining claims was settled in November 2021.\nThe protection provided by our service marks is limited.\nOur rights to the trade names \u201cRCI Hospitality Holdings, Inc.,\u201d \u201cRick\u2019s,\u201d \u201cRick\u2019s Cabaret,\u201d \u201cTootsie\u2019s Cabaret,\u201d \u201cClub Onyx,\u201d \u201cXTC Cabaret,\u201d \u201cTemptations,\u201d \u201cJaguars,\u201d \u201cDowntown Cabaret,\u201d \u201cCabaret East,\u201d \u201cBombshells Restaurant and Bar,\u201d \u201cVee Lounge,\u201d \u201cMile High Men\u2019s Club,\u201d \u201cCountry Rock Cabaret,\u201d \u201cPT\u2019s,\u201d and \u201cDiamond Cabaret\u201d are established under common law, based upon our substantial and continuous use of these trade names in interstate commerce, some of which have been in use at least as early as 1987.

There can be no assurance that these steps we have taken to protect our service marks will be adequate to deter misappropriation of our protected intellectual property rights. Litigation may be necessary in the future to protect our rights from infringement, which may be costly and time consuming. The loss of the intellectual property rights owned or claimed by us could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAs a result of the acquisition that closed on October 18, 2021, we obtained the rights to the following service mark registrations from the Patent and Trademark Office: \u201cMILE HIGH MEN\u2019S CLUB,\u201d \u201cMHMC logo,\u201d \u201cAFTER DARK,\u201d \u201cCOUNTRY ROCK CABARET,\u201d \u201cPT\u2019S,\u201d \u201cDIAMOND CABARET,\u201d and \u201cNAUGHTY MOMMIES NIGHT OUT\u201d.\nWe are dependent on key personnel.\nOur future success is dependent, in a large part, on retaining the services of Eric Langan, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Bradley Chhay, our Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Langan possesses a unique and comprehensive knowledge of our industry. While Mr. Langan has no present plans to leave or retire in the near future, his loss could have a negative effect on our operating, marketing and financial performance if we are unable to find an adequate replacement with similar knowledge and experience within our industry. Mr. Chhay possesses thorough familiarity with our accounting system and how it affects our operations. Mr. Chhay is also vital in our due diligence efforts when acquiring clubs. We maintain key-man life insurance with respect to Mr. Langan but not for Mr. Chhay. Although Messrs. Langan and Chhay have signed employment agreements with us (as described herein), there can be no assurance that Mr. Langan or Mr. Chhay will continue to be employed by us.\nA failure to maintain food safety throughout the supply chain and food-borne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our business.\nFood safety is a top priority, and we dedicate substantial resources to ensuring that our guests enjoy safe, quality food products. However, food safety issues could be caused at the point of source or by food suppliers or distributors and, as a result, be out of our control. In addition, regardless of the source or cause, any report of food-borne illnesses such as E. coli, hepatitis A, trichinosis or salmonella, and other food safety issues including food tampering or contamination, at one of our restaurants or clubs could adversely affect the reputation of our brands and have a negative impact on our sales. Even instances of food-borne illness, food tampering or food contamination occurring solely at restaurants of our competitors could result in negative publicity about the food service industry generally and adversely impact our sales. The occurrence of food-borne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients, resulting in higher costs and lower margins.\nOther risk factors may adversely affect our financial performance.\nOther risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements by affecting, among many things, pricing, consumer spending and consumer confidence, include, without limitation, changes in economic conditions and financial and credit markets, credit availability, increased fuel costs and availability for our employees, customers and suppliers, health epidemics or pandemics or the prospects of these events (such as reports on avian flu or COVID-19), consumer perceptions of food safety, changes in consumer tastes and behaviors, governmental monetary policies, changes in demographic trends, terrorist acts, energy shortages and rolling blackouts, and weather (including, major hurricanes and regional snow storms) and other acts of God.\nWe are also subject to the general risks of inflation, increases in minimum wage, health care, and other benefits that may have a material adverse effect on our cost structure, and the disruption in our supply chain caused by several factor, including the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRisk related to our common stock\nWe must continue to meet NASDAQ Global Market Continued Listing Requirements, or we risk delisting.\nOur securities are currently listed for trading on the NASDAQ Global Market. We must continue to satisfy NASDAQ\u2019s continued listing requirements or risk delisting which would have an adverse effect on our business. If our securities are ever delisted from NASDAQ, they may trade on the over-the-counter market, which may be a less liquid market. In such case, our shareholders\u2019 ability to trade or obtain quotations of the market value of shares of our common stock would be severely limited because of lower trading volumes and transaction delays. These factors could contribute to lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for our securities.\nWe may be subject to allegations, defamations, or other detrimental conduct by third parties, which could harm our reputation and cause us to lose customers and/or contribute to a deflation of our stock price.\nWe have been subject to allegations by third parties or purported former employees, negative internet postings, and other adverse public exposure on our business, operations and staff compensation. We may also become the target of defamations or other detrimental conduct by third parties or disgruntled former or current employees. Such conduct may include complaints, anonymous or otherwise, to regulatory agencies, media or other organizations. We may be subject to government or regulatory investigation or other proceedings as a result of such third-party conduct and may be required to spend significant time and incur substantial costs to address such third-party conduct, and there is no assurance that we will be able to conclusively refute each of the allegations within a reasonable period of time, or at all. Any government or regulatory investigations initiated as a result of the above may cause a deflation in our stock price. Additionally, allegations, directly or indirectly against us, may be posted on the internet, including social media platforms by anyone, whether or not related to us, on an anonymous basis. Any negative publicity on us or our management can be quickly and widely disseminated. Social media platforms and devices immediately publish the content of their subscribers and participants post, often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted. Information posted may be inaccurate and adverse to us, and it may harm our reputation, business or prospects. The harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction. Our reputation may be negatively affected as a result of the public dissemination of negative and potentially false information about our business and operations, which in turn may cause us to lose customers.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate and could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors due to seasonality and other factors, some of which are beyond our control, resulting in a decline in our stock price.\nOur nightclub operations are affected by seasonal factors. Historically, we have experienced reduced revenues from April through September with the strongest operating results occurring from October through March. As a result, our quarterly and annual operating results and comparable restaurant sales may fluctuate significantly as a result of seasonality and the factors discussed above. Accordingly, results for any one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other fiscal quarter or for any fiscal year and same-store sales for any particular future period may decrease. In the future, operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In that event, the price of our common stock would likely decrease.\nAnti-takeover effects of the issuance of our preferred stock could adversely affect our common stock.\nOur Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series, to fix the number of shares constituting any such series, and to fix the rights and preferences of the shares constituting any series, without any further vote or action by the stockholders. The issuance of preferred stock by the Board of Directors could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock. For example, such issuance could result in a class of securities outstanding that would have preferences with respect to voting rights and dividends and in liquidation over the common stock, and could (upon conversion or otherwise) enjoy all of the rights appurtenant to common stock. The Board\u2019s authority to issue preferred stock could discourage potential takeover attempts and could delay or prevent a change in control of the Company through merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise by making such attempts more difficult to achieve or costlier. There are no issued and outstanding shares of preferred stock; there are no agreements or understandings for the issuance of preferred stock; and the Board of Directors has no present intention to issue preferred stock.\nFuture sales or the perception of future sales of a substantial amount of our common stock may depress our stock price.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or as a result of the perception that these sales could occur. In addition, these factors could make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of common stock.\nOur stock price has been volatile and may fluctuate in the future.\nThe trading price of our securities may fluctuate significantly. This price may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u25cf our performance and prospects;\n\u25cf the depth and liquidity of the market for our securities;\n\u25cf investor perception of us and the industry in which we operate;\n\u25cf changes in earnings estimates or buy/sell recommendations by analysts;\n\u25cf general financial and other market conditions; and\n\u25cf domestic economic conditions.\nPublic stock markets have experienced, and may experience, extreme price and trading volume volatility. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our securities.\nCumulative voting is not available to our stockholders.\nCumulative voting in the election of Directors is expressly denied in our Articles of Incorporation. Accordingly, the holder or holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock may elect all of our Directors.\nOur directors and officers have limited liability and have rights to indemnification.\nOur Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws provide, as permitted by governing Texas law, that our directors and officers shall not be personally liable to us or any of our stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director or officer, with certain exceptions. The Articles further provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers against expenses and liabilities they incur to defend, settle, or satisfy any civil litigation or criminal action brought against them on account of their being or having been its directors or officers unless, in such action, they are adjudged to have acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct.\nThe inclusion of these provisions in the Articles may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and officers and may discourage or deter stockholders or management from bringing a lawsuit against directors and officers for breach of their duty of care, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise have benefited us and our stockholders.\nThe Articles provide for the indemnification of our officers and directors, and the advancement to them of expenses in connection with any proceedings and claims, to the fullest extent permitted by Texas law. The Articles include related provisions meant to facilitate the indemnitee\u2019s receipt of such benefits. These provisions cover, among other things: (i) specification of the method of determining entitlement to indemnification and the selection of independent counsel that will in some cases make such determination, (ii) specification of certain time periods by which certain payments or determinations must be made and actions must be taken, and (iii) the establishment of certain presumptions in favor of an indemnitee.\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to the foregoing provisions, we have been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.", "PERMNO": 82518, "SIC": 5810, "TIC": "RICK"}
