{"cik": "1703489", "company": "PDL Community Bancorp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-17", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe effects of the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (\"COVID-19\") has negatively affected the global economy, United States economy, our local economy and our markets and may disrupt our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 global and national health emergency has caused significant disruption in the international and United States economies and financial markets. Further spread of COVID-19 could cause additional quarantines, cancellation of events and travel, business and school shutdowns, reduction in business activity and financial transactions, labor shortages, supply chain\ninterruptions and overall economic and financial market instability. The COVID-19 outbreak in the United States may disrupt our operations through its impact on our employees, customers and their businesses, and certain industries in which our customers operate. Disruptions to our customers may impair their ability to fulfill their obligations to the Bank and result in increased risk of delinquencies, defaults, foreclosures, declining collateral values associated with our existing loans, and losses on our loans. Further, the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak has caused severe disruptions in the United States economy and may materially disrupt banking and other financial activity generally and in the areas in which the Company operates. This would likely result in a decline in demand for our products and services, including loans and deposits which would negatively impact our liquidity position and our growth strategy. Any one or more of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, consolidated financial condition, and consolidated results of operations. The Company is taking precautions to protect the safety and well-being of our employees and customers. However, no assurance can be given that the steps being taken will be deemed to be adequate or appropriate, nor can we predict the level of disruption which will occur to our employee\u2019s ability to provide customer support and service.\nMultifamily, nonresidential and construction and land loans may carry greater credit risk than loans secured by one-to-four family real estate.\nOur focus is primarily on prudently growing our multifamily, nonresidential and construction and land loan portfolio. At December 31, 2019, $556.8 million, or 57.6%, of our loan portfolio consisted of multifamily, nonresidential and construction and land loans as compared to $517.0 million, or 55.6%, of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2018. Given their larger balances and the complexity of the underlying collateral, multifamily, nonresidential and construction and land loans generally expose a lender to greater credit risk than loans secured by one-to-four family real estate.\nConsequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one-to-four family residential real estate loan. In addition, any adverse developments with respect to borrowers or groups of borrowers that have more than one of these types of loans outstanding can expose us to significantly greater risk of loss compared to borrowers or groups of borrowers that only have one type of these loans. If loans that are collateralized by real estate or other business assets become troubled and the values of the underlying collateral have been significantly impaired, we may not be able to recover the full contractual amounts of principal and interest that we anticipated at the time we originated the loans, which could cause us to increase our provision for loan losses which would, in turn, adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Further, if we foreclose on this type of collateral, our holding period for that collateral may be longer than for one-to-four family real estate loans because there are fewer potential purchasers of that collateral, which can result in substantial holding costs.\nSome of our borrowers have more than one of these types of loans outstanding. At December 31, 2019, 1,439 loans with an aggregate balance of $860.1 million are to borrowers with only one loan. Another 176 loans are to borrowers with two loans each with a corresponding aggregate balance of $89.4 million. In addition, 30 loans are to borrowers with three loans each and another 12 loans to borrowers with four loans each with a corresponding aggregate balance of $13.5 million and $1.8 million, respectively. One borrower accounts for 8 loans with an aggregate balance of $1.3 million.\nThe unseasoned nature of our multifamily, nonresidential and construction and land loans portfolio may result in changes to our estimates of collectability, which may lead to additional provisions or charge-offs, which could hurt our profits.\nOur multifamily, nonresidential and construction and land loan portfolio has increased approximately $39.8 million, or 7.7%, from $517.0 million at December 31, 2018 to $556.8 million at December 31, 2019 and increased approximately $110.0 million, or 27.0%, from $407.0 million at December 31, 2017 to $517.0 million at December 31, 2018. A large portion of our multifamily, nonresidential and construction and land loan portfolio is unseasoned and does not provide us with a significant payment or charge-off history pattern from which to judge future collectability. Currently, we estimate potential charge-offs using a rolling 12 quarter average and peer data adjusted for qualitative factors specific to us. As a result, it may be difficult to predict the future performance of this part of our loan portfolio. These loans may have delinquency or charge-off levels above our historical experience or current estimates, which could adversely affect our future performance. Further, these types of loans generally have larger balances and involve a greater risk than one-to-four family owner-occupied residential mortgage loans. Accordingly, if we make any errors in judgment in the collectability of our multifamily, nonresidential and construction and land loans, any resulting charge-offs may be larger on a per loan basis than those incurred historically with our residential mortgage loans.\nOur business may be adversely affected by credit risk associated with residential property.\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, one-to-four family residential real estate loans amounted to $397.2 million and $396.0 million, or 41.2% and 42.6%, respectively, of our total loan portfolio. Of these amounts, $305.3 million and $303.2 million, or 76.9% and 76.6%, respectively, is comprised of one-to-four family residential investor-owned properties. One-to-four family residential mortgage lending, whether owner-occupied or non-owner occupied is generally sensitive to regional and local economic conditions that significantly impact the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations. Declines in real estate values could cause some of our one-to-four family residential mortgages to be inadequately collateralized, which would expose us to a greater risk of loss if we seek to recover on defaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral.\nOne-to-four family residential mortgage lending, whether owner-occupied or non-owner-occupied, with higher combined loan-to-value ratios are more sensitive to declining property values than those with lower combined loan-to-value ratios and therefore may experience a higher incidence of default and severity of losses. In addition, if the borrowers sell their properties, they may be unable to repay their loans in full from the sale proceeds. For those home equity loans and lines of credit secured by a second mortgage, it is unlikely that we will be successful in recovering all or a portion of our loan proceeds in the event of default unless we are prepared to repay the first mortgage loan and such repayment and the costs associated with a foreclosure are justified by the value of the property. In addition, the current judicial and legal climate makes it difficult to foreclose on residential properties expeditiously and with reasonable costs. For these reasons, we may experience higher rates of delinquencies, default and losses on our one-to-four family residential mortgage loans.\nThe geographic concentration of our loan portfolio and lending activities makes us vulnerable to a downturn in the local economy.\nAlthough there is not a single employer or industry in our market area on which a significant number of our customers are dependent, a substantial portion of our loan portfolio is composed of loans secured by property located in the greater New York metropolitan area. This can make us vulnerable to a downturn in the local economy and real estate markets. Adverse conditions in the local economy, such as unemployment, recession, a catastrophic event or other factors beyond our control, could impact the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, which could adversely impact our net interest income. Decreases in local real estate values caused by economic conditions or other events could adversely affect the value of the property used as collateral for our loans, which could cause us to realize a loss in the event of a foreclosure. See \u201cBusiness - Market Area and - Competition.\u201d\nIf our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings and capital could decrease.\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, our allowance for loan losses totaled $12.3 million and $12.7 million, which represented 1.27%, and 1.36% of total loans at such dates. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for many of our loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we review our loans, loss and delinquency experience, and business and commercial real estate peer data, and we evaluate other factors including, but not limited to, current economic conditions. If our assumptions are incorrect, or if delinquencies or non-performing loans increase, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, which would require additions to our allowance, which in turn, could materially decrease our net income.\nIn addition, our regulators, as well as auditors, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the allowance for loan losses and, as a result of such reviews, we may determine that it is appropriate to increase the allowance for loan losses by recognizing additional provisions for loan losses charged to income, or to charge off loans, which, net of any recoveries, would decrease the allowance for loan losses. Any such additional provisions for loan losses or charge-offs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nA worsening of economic conditions in our market area could reduce demand for our products and services and/or result in increases in our level of nonperforming loans, which could adversely affect our operations, financial condition and earnings.\nLocal economic conditions have a significant impact on the ability of our borrowers to repay loans and the value of the collateral securing their loans. Any deterioration in economic conditions could have the following consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations:\n\u2022\ndemand for our products and services may decline;\n\u2022\nloan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures may increase;\n\u2022\ncollateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, thereby reducing customers\u2019 future borrowing power, and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with existing loans; and\n\u2022\nthe net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us.\nMoreover, a significant decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation, recession, acts of terrorism, an outbreak of hostilities, a pandemic or other international or domestic calamities, unemployment or other factors beyond our control could further impact these local economic conditions and could further negatively affect the financial results of our banking operations. In addition, deflationary pressures, while possibly lowering our operating costs, could have a significant negative effect on our borrowers, especially our business borrowers, and the values of underlying collateral securing their loans, which could negatively affect our financial performance.\nOur business strategy includes growth, and our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively. Growing our operations could also cause our expenses to increase faster than our revenues.\nOur business strategy includes growth in assets, loans, deposits and the scale of our operations. Achieving such growth will require us to attract customers that currently bank at other financial institutions in our market area. Our ability to successfully grow will depend on a variety of factors, including our ability to attract and retain experienced bankers, the continued availability of desirable business opportunities, competition from other financial institutions in our market area and our ability to manage our growth. Growth opportunities may not be available or we may not be able to manage our growth successfully. If we do not manage our growth effectively, our financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected. Furthermore, there can be considerable costs involved in expanding deposit and lending capacity that generally require a period of time to generate the necessary revenues to offset their costs, especially in areas in which we do not have an established presence and require alternative delivery methods. Accordingly, any such business expansion can be expected to negatively impact our earnings for some period of time until certain economies of scale are reached. Our expenses could be further increased if we encounter delays in modernizing existing facilities, opening of new branches or deploying new services.\nWe depend on our management team to implement our business strategy and execute successful operations and we could be harmed by the loss of their services.\nWe are dependent upon the services of the members of our senior management team who direct our strategy and operations. Members of our senior management team, or lending personnel who possess expertise in our markets and key business relationships, could be difficult to replace. Our loss of these persons, or our inability to hire additional qualified personnel, could impact our ability to implement our business strategy and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our ability to compete in our markets. See \u201cDirectors, Executives Officers, and Corporate Governance.\u201d\nAdherence to our internal policies and procedures by management is critical to our performance and how we are perceived by our regulators.\nOur internal policies and procedures are a critical component of our corporate governance and, in some cases, compliance with applicable regulations. We adopt internal policies and procedures to guide management and employees regarding the operation and conduct of our business. We may not always achieve absolute compliance with all of our policies and procedures. Any deviation or non-adherence to these internal policies and procedures, whether intentional or unintentional, could have a detrimental effect on our management, operations or financial condition.\nOur efficiency ratio is high, and we anticipate that it may remain high, as a result of the ongoing implementation of our business strategy.\nOur non-interest expense totaled $46.6 million and $34.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Although we continue to analyze our expenses and pursue efficiencies where available, our efficiency ratio remains high as a result of the implementation of our business strategy combined with operating in an expensive market. Our efficiency ratio was 114.19% and 87.26% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. If we are unable to successfully implement our business strategy and increase our revenues, our profitability could be adversely affected.\nThe historically low interest rate environment and the possibility that we may access higher-cost funds to support our loan growth and operations may adversely affect our net interest income and profitability.\nThe Federal Reserve Board increased the benchmark federal funds rate starting in December 2016 to December 2018 by an aggregate of 200 basis points. Thereafter, the Federal Reserve Board reduced the benchmark federal funds rate by a total of 75 basis points through three rate cuts during the second-half of 2019. On March 3, 2020, and March 15, 2020, the Federal Reserve Board, in emergency actions, decreased the targeted federal funds rate by an aggregate of 150 basis points. These rate cuts were in response to unprecedented market turmoil. Because of significant competitive pressures in our markets and the negative impact of these pressures on our deposit and loan pricing, our net interest margin was and is being negatively impacted by these rate cuts and additional rate cuts may further negatively impact our net interest margin. These rate cuts and further rate cuts in 2020 could also negatively impact our net interest income, particularly if we are unable to lower our funding costs as quickly as the rates we earn on our loans declines.\nAn important component of our ability to mitigate pressures of a down rate environment will be our ability to reduce the rates we pay on deposits, including core deposits. If we are unable to reduce these rates, because of competitive pricing pressures in our markets, liquidity purposes or otherwise, our net interest margin will be negatively impacted. In addition, as our growth in earnings assets has outpaced growth in our core deposits in recent quarters, we have had to increase our reliance on noncore funding. These funding sources may be more rate sensitive than our core depositors, and, accordingly, we may be limited in our ability to reduce the rates we pay on these funds while maintaining on-balance sheet liquidity levels consistent with our policies, which would negatively impact our net interest margin. We seek to limit the amount of non-core funding we utilize to support our growth. If we are unable to grow our core funding at rates that are sufficient to match or exceed our loan growth we may be required to slow our loan growth.\nAs interest rates change, we expect that we will periodically experience \u201cgaps\u201d in the interest rate sensitivities of our assets and liabilities, meaning that either our interest-bearing liabilities (usually deposits and borrowings) will be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than our interest-earning assets (usually loans and investment securities), or vice versa. In either event, if market interest rates should move contrary to our position, this \u201cgap\u201d may work against us, and our results of operations and financial condition may be negatively affected. We attempt to manage our risk from changes in market interest rates by adjusting the rates, maturity, repricing characteristics, and balances of the different types of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Interest rate risk management techniques are not exact. From time to time we have repositioned a portion of our investment securities portfolio in an effort to better position our balance sheet for potential changes in short-term rates. We employ the use of models and modeling techniques to quantify the levels of risks to net interest income, which inherently involve the use of assumptions, judgments, and estimates. While we strive to ensure the accuracy of our modeled interest rate risk profile, there are inherent limitations and imprecisions in this determination and actual results may differ.\nFuture changes in interest rates could reduce our profits and asset values.\nNet income (loss) is the amount by which net interest income and non-interest income exceeds (or does not exceed) non-interest expense and the provisions for loan losses and taxes. Net interest income makes up a majority of our income and is based on the difference between:\n\u2022\nthe interest income we earn on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities; and\n\u2022\nthe interest expense we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings.\nThe rates we earn on our assets and the rates we pay on our liabilities are generally fixed for a contractual period of time. Like many savings institutions, our liabilities generally have shorter contractual maturities than our assets. This imbalance can create significant earnings volatility because market interest rates change over time. In a period of rising interest rates, the interest income we earn on our assets may not increase as rapidly as the interest we pay on our liabilities. In a period of declining interest rates, the interest income we earn on our assets may decrease more rapidly than the interest we pay on our liabilities, as borrowers prepay mortgage loans, and mortgage-backed securities and callable investment securities are called, requiring us to reinvest those cash flows at lower interest rates.\nIn addition, changes in interest rates can affect the average life of loans and mortgage-backed and related securities. A decline in interest rates results in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed and related securities as borrowers refinance their debt to reduce their borrowing costs. This creates reinvestment risk, which is the risk that we may not be able to reinvest prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates we earned on the prepaid loans or securities. Furthermore, an inverted interest rate yield curve, where short-term interest rates (which are usually the rates at which financial institutions borrow funds) are higher than long-term interest rates (which are usually the rates at which financial institutions lend funds for fixed-rate loans), can reduce a financial institution\u2019s net interest margin and create financial risk for financial institutions who originate and hold longer-term, fixed rate mortgage loans.\nAny substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Changes in the level of interest rates also may negatively affect the value of our assets and ultimately affect our earnings.\nWe monitor interest rate risk through the use of simulation models, including estimates of the amounts by which the economic value of our assets and liabilities (the Economic Value of Equity Model \u201cEVE\u201d) and our net interest income would change in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates. At December 31, 2019, in the event of an instantaneous 100 basis point decrease in interest rates, we estimate that we would experience a 2.03% increase in EVE and a 0.03% decrease in net interest income. For further discussion of how changes in interest rates could impact us, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Management of Market Risk-Net Interest Income Simulation Models and-Economic Value of Equity Model .\u201d\nChanges in the valuation of securities held could adversely affect us.\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, our securities portfolio totaled $21.5 million and $27.1 million, which represented 2.0% and 2.6% of total assets, respectively. All of the securities in our portfolio are classified as available-for-sale. Accordingly, a decline in the fair value of our securities could cause a material decline in our reported equity and/or net income. At least quarterly, and more frequently when warranted by economic or market conditions, management evaluates all securities classified as available-for-sale with a decline in fair value below the amortized cost of the investment to determine whether the impairment is deemed to be other-than-temporary impairment (\u201cOTTI\u201d). For impaired debt securities that are intended to be sold, or more likely than not will be required to be sold, the full amount of market decline is recognized as OTTI through earnings. Credit-related OTTI for all other impaired debt securities is recognized through earnings. Non-credit related OTTI for debt securities is recognized in other comprehensive income net of applicable taxes. A decline in the market value of our securities portfolio could adversely affect our earnings.\nStrong competition within our market areas may limit our growth and profitability.\nCompetition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. In our market area, we compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, brokerage and investment banking firms and unregulated or less regulated non-banking entities, operating locally and elsewhere. Many of these competitors have substantially greater resources and higher lending limits than we have and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide. In addition, some of our competitors offer loans with lower interest rates on more attractive terms than loans we offer. Competition also makes it increasingly difficult and costly to attract and retain qualified employees. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market area. If we must raise interest rates paid on deposits or lower interest rates charged on our loans, our net interest margin and profitability could be adversely affected.\nThe financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of new legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Banks, securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company, which can offer virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting) and merchant banking. Also, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. Many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. Additionally, due to their size, many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than we can. We expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. For additional information see \u201cBusiness -Market Area and-Competition.\u201d\nOur small size makes it more difficult for us to compete.\nOur small asset size makes it more difficult to compete with other financial institutions that are larger and can more easily afford to invest in the marketing and technologies needed to attract and retain customers. Because our principal source of income is the net interest income we earn on our loans and investments after deducting interest paid on deposits and other sources of funds, our ability to generate the revenues needed to cover our expenses and finance such investments is limited by the size of our loan and investment portfolios. Accordingly, we are not always able to offer new products and services as quickly as our competitors. Our lower earnings may also make it more difficult to offer competitive salaries and benefits. In addition, our smaller customer base may make it difficult to generate meaningful non-interest income from such activities as securities and insurance brokerage. Finally, as a smaller institution, we are disproportionately affected by the continually increasing costs of compliance with new banking and other regulations.\nChanges in laws and regulations and the cost of regulatory compliance with new laws and regulations may adversely affect our operations and/or increase our costs of operations.\nPonce Bank is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the OCC, and the Company is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve Board. Such regulation and supervision governs the activities in which our institution and its holding company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund and the depositors and borrowers of Ponce Bank, rather than for our stockholders. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on our operations, the classification of our assets and influencing the level of our allowance for loan losses. These regulations, along with existing tax, accounting, securities, insurance and monetary laws, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations, control the methods by which financial institutions conduct business, implement strategic initiatives and tax compliance, and govern financial reporting and disclosures. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material impact on our operations. Further, changes in accounting standards can be both difficult to predict and involve judgment and discretion in interpretation by us. These changes could materially impact, potentially even retroactively, how we report our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act has significantly changed the regulation of banks and savings institutions and affects the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new rules and regulations and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. The federal agencies have been given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations, many of which are not in final form. As a result, we cannot at this time predict the full extent to which the Dodd-Frank Act will impact our business, operations or financial condition. However, compliance with the Dodd-Frank Act and its regulations and policies has already resulted in changes to our business and operations, as well as additional costs, and has diverted management\u2019s time from other business activities, all of which have adversely affected our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, in February 2017, the President issued an Executive Order stating that a policy of his administration would be to make regulations efficient, effective, and appropriately tailored. The Executive Order directed certain regulatory agencies to review and identify laws and regulations that inhibit federal regulation of the U.S. financial system in a manner consistent with the policies stated in the Executive Order. Any changes in laws or regulation as a result of this review could result in a repeal, amendment to or delayed implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act. On May 24, 2018, President Trump signed into law a bipartisan regulatory reform bill. Among other provisions, the bill increased the threshold to qualify for the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement from $1.0 billion to $3.0 billion and also provide for charter flexibility for federally-chartered savings banks and associations to adopt the powers of a national bank.\nNon-compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, Bank Secrecy Act, or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions.\nThe USA PATRIOT and Bank Secrecy Acts require financial institutions to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury\u2019s Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions, including restrictions on conducting acquisitions or establishing new branches. The policies and procedures we have adopted that are designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations may not be effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations.\nOur ability to originate loans could be restricted by recently adopted federal regulations.\nThe CFPB has issued a rule intended to clarify how lenders can avoid legal liability under the Dodd-Frank Act, which holds lenders accountable for ensuring a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a mortgage loan. Under the rule, loans that meet the \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d definition will be presumed to have complied with the new ability-to-repay standard. Under the rule, a \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d loan must not contain certain specified features, including:\n\u2022\nexcessive upfront points and fees (those exceeding 3% of the total loan amount, less \u201cbona fide discount points\u201d for prime loans);\n\u2022\ninterest-only payments;\n\u2022\nnegative amortization; and\n\u2022\nterms of longer than 30 years.\nAlso, to qualify as a \u201cqualified mortgage,\u201d a loan must be made to a borrower whose total monthly debt-to-income ratio does not exceed 43%. Lenders must also verify and document the income and financial resources relied upon to qualify a borrower for the loan and underwrite the loan based on a fully amortizing payment schedule and maximum interest rate during the first five years, taking into account all applicable taxes, insurance and assessments.\nIn addition, the CFPB has adopted rules and published forms that combine certain disclosures that consumers receive in connection with applying for and closing on certain mortgage loans under the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act.\nWe face significant operational risks because the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions and increased reliance on technology, including risk of loss related to cyber security breaches.\nWe operate in diverse markets and rely on the ability of our employees and systems to process a high number of transactions and to collect, process, transmit and store significant amounts of confidential information regarding our customers, employees and others and concerning our own business, operations, plans and strategies. Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from our operations, including but not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside our company, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, systems failures or interruptions, breaches of our internal control systems and compliance requirements, and business continuation and disaster recovery. Insurance coverage may not be available for such losses, or where available, such losses may exceed insurance limits. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of operational deficiencies or as a result of non-compliance with applicable regulatory standards or customer attrition due to potential negative publicity. In addition, we outsource some of our data processing to certain third-party providers. If these third-party providers encounter difficulties, including as a result of cyber-attacks or information security breaches, or if we have difficulty communicating with them, our ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and our business operations could be adversely affected.\nIn the event of a breakdown in our internal control systems, improper operation of systems or improper employee actions, or a breach of our security systems, including if confidential or proprietary information were to be mishandled, misused or lost, we could suffer financial loss, face regulatory action, civil litigation and/or suffer damage to our reputation.\nWe are subject to stringent capital requirements, which may adversely impact our return on equity, require us to raise additional capital, or limit our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares.\nThe Bank\u2019s minimum capital requirements are: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6.0%; (iii) a total capital ratio of 8.0%; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%. The capital rule also establishes a \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d of 2.5%, and, now that it is fully phased in, results in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 8.5%; and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The capital conservation buffer requirement which began phasing in January of 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and which increased each year until fully implemented in January, 2019, to 2.5%. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount.\nWe have analyzed the effects of these capital requirements, and we believe that Ponce Bank meets all of these new requirements, including the full 2.5% capital conservation buffer.\nThe application of more stringent capital requirements could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, and result in regulatory actions if we are unable to comply with such requirements. Furthermore, the imposition of liquidity requirements in connection with the implementation of the requirements of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (\u201cBasel III\u201d) could result in our having to lengthen the term of our funding sources, change our business models or increase our holdings of liquid assets. Ponce Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends to the Company will be limited if it does not have the capital conservation buffer required by the capital rules, which may further limit the Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends to stockholders. See \u201cRegulation and Supervision-Federal Banking Regulation-Capital Requirements.\u201d\nThe cost of finance and accounting systems, procedures and controls in order to satisfy our public company reporting requirements increases our expenses.\nThe obligations of being a public company, including the substantial public reporting obligations, require significant expenditures and place additional demands on our management team. We have made, and will continue to make, changes to our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting and accounting systems to meet our reporting obligations as a stand-alone public company. However, the measures we take may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations as a public company. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Any failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price. In addition, we may need to hire additional compliance, accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical knowledge, and we may not be able to do so in a timely fashion. As a result, we may need to rely on outside consultants to provide these services for us until qualified personnel are hired. These obligations will increase our operating expenses and could divert our management\u2019s attention from our operations.\nChanges in accounting standards could affect reported earnings.\nThe bodies responsible for establishing accounting standards, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC and other regulatory bodies, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting guidance that governs the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply new or revised guidance retroactively.\nChanges in management\u2019s estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and our financial condition or operating results.\nOur management is and will be required under applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of a specified date to file periodic reports under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, including our consolidated financial statements. These estimates and assumptions are based on management\u2019s best estimates and experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. Materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. Areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include our evaluation of the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses and our determinations with respect to amounts owed for income taxes.\nLegal and regulatory proceedings and related matters could adversely affect us.\nWe have been and may in the future become involved in legal and regulatory proceedings. We consider most of the proceedings to be in the normal course of our business or typical for the industry; however, it is inherently difficult to assess the outcome of these matters, and we may not prevail in any proceedings or litigation. There could be substantial cost and management diversion in such litigation and proceedings, and any adverse determination could have a materially adverse effect on our business, brand or image, or our financial condition and results of our operations.\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities or properties we own.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate, and we could become subject to environmental liabilities with respect to one or more of these properties, or with respect to properties that we own in operating our business. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing defaulted loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous conditions or toxic substances are found on these properties, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage, civil fines and criminal penalties regardless of when the hazardous conditions or toxic substances first affected any particular property. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses to address unknown liabilities and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. Our policies, which require us to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on non-residential real property, may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are a community bank and our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance.\nWe are a community bank, and our reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business. A key component of our business strategy is to rely on our reputation for customer service and knowledge of local markets to expand our presence by capturing new business opportunities from existing and prospective customers in our market area and contiguous areas. As such, we strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation. This is done, in part, by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities we serve, delivering superior service to our customers and caring about our customers and associates. If our reputation is negatively affected by the actions of our employees, by our inability to conduct our operations in a manner that is appealing to current or prospective customers, or otherwise, our business and, therefore, our operating results may be materially adversely affected.\nOur historical markets, minority and immigrant individuals, may be threatened by gentrification and adverse political developments, which could decrease our growth and profitability.\nWe believe that our historical strength has been our focus on the minority and immigrant markets. The continuing displacement of minorities due to gentrification of our communities may adversely affect us unless we are able to adapt and increase the acceptance of our products and services by non-minority customers. We may also be unfavorably impacted by political developments unfavorable to markets that are dependent on immigrant populations.", "PERMNO": 16995, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "PDLB"}
