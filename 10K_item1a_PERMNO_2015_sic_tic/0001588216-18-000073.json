RISK FACTORS\nThe nature of the business activities conducted by the Company subjects it to certain hazards and risks. The following is a summary of some of the material risks relating to the Company\u2019s business activities. Other risks are described in \u201cPart I. Item 1. Business-Competition and Markets\u201d and \u201c-Regulation of the Oil and Gas Industry,\u201d and \u201cPart II. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\u201d These risks are not the only risks facing the Company. The Company\u2019s business could also be affected by additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that it currently deems to be immaterial. If any of these risks actually occurs, it could materially harm the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations and impair the Company\u2019s ability to implement business plans or complete development activities as scheduled. In that case, the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock could decline.\nOil, NGLs and natural gas prices are volatile. A reduction or sustained decline in commodity prices may adversely affect our operations, financial condition and level of expenditures for the development of oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves.\nThe prices we receive for our oil, NGLs and natural gas production heavily influence our revenue, operating results, profitability, access to capital, future rate of growth and carrying value of our properties. Oil, NGLs and natural gas are commodities and, therefore, their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor actual or expected changes in supply and demand for oil, NGLs and natural gas, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond our control. Historically, the commodities markets have been volatile, and these markets will likely continue to be volatile in the future. Significant and sustained declines in the prices we receive for our oil, NGLs and natural gas production, such as the decline experienced from 2015 through 2017, could adversely affect our operations, financial condition, access to capital, future rate of growth, carrying value of our properties and level of expenditures. The prices we receive for our production, and the levels of our production, depend on numerous factors beyond our control and include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nthe level of global exploration and production;\n\u2022\nthe level of global inventories;\n\u2022\nactions of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, its members and other state-controlled oil companies relating to oil price and production controls;\n\u2022\nworldwide and regional economic conditions affecting the global supply and demand for oil, NGLs and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe price and quantity of imports of foreign oil, NGLs and natural gas;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic conditions in or affecting other producing countries, including U.S. sanctions on oil producing countries and conflicts in the Middle East, Africa, South America and Russia;\n\u2022\nprevailing prices on local price indexes in the areas in which we operate and expectations about future commodity prices;\n\u2022\nthe proximity, capacity, cost and availability of gathering and transportation facilities, and other factors that result in differentials to benchmark prices;\n\u2022\nlocalized and global supply and demand fundamentals and transportation availability;\n\u2022\nthe cost of exploring for, developing, producing and transporting reserves;\n\u2022\nweather conditions and other natural disasters;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels;\n\u2022\nexpectations about future commodity prices;\n\u2022\ndomestic, local and foreign governmental regulation and taxes;\n\u2022\nspeculation as to the future price of oil, NGLs and natural gas and the speculative trading of oil, NGLs and natural gas and the trading prices of future contracts; and\n\u2022\neffect of energy conservation efforts.\nThe long-term effects of these and other conditions on the prices of oil, NGLs and natural gas are uncertain. Global economic and political conditions have driven oil and natural gas prices down from their highs significantly since 2014. These conditions may continue for an extended period.\nLower commodity prices may reduce our cash flows and borrowing ability. We may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, which could lead to a decline in our reserves as existing reserves are depleted. Lower commodity prices may also reduce the amount of oil, NGLs and natural gas that we can produce economically, and a significant portion of our exploitation, development and exploration projects could become unprofitable. This may result in us having to make significant downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves and impair the carrying value of assets. As a result, if commodity prices remain depressed for a lengthy period of time or experience a further substantial or extended decline, our future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur derivative activities could result in financial losses or could reduce our earnings. Additionally, our hedging program may not protect us against continuing and prolonged declines in the price of oil, NGLs and natural gas.\nTo achieve more predictable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in the prices of oil, NGLs and natural gas, we enter into derivative instruments from time to time to hedge a portion of our production that could result in both realized and unrealized losses. The extent of our commodity price exposure is related largely to the effectiveness and scope of our commodity derivative contracts. As of December 31, 2017, we had entered into hedging contracts covering approximately 10,707 MBbls and 2,555 MBbls of our projected oil production for 2018 and 2019, respectively. Subsequent to December 31, 2017, we entered into additional hedging contracts covering approximately 698 MBbls and 2,555 MBbls of our projected oil production for 2018 and 2019, respectively. Accordingly, our earnings may fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in fair value of our derivative instruments.\nDerivative instruments may expose us to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when:\n\u2022\nproduction is less than the volume covered by the derivative instruments;\n\u2022\nthe counterparty to the derivative instrument defaults on its contractual obligations;\n\u2022\nthere is an increase in the differential between the underlying price in the derivative instrument and actual prices received; or\n\u2022\nthere are issues with regard to legal enforceability of such instruments.\nThe use of derivative instruments may, in some cases, require the posting of collateral, including cash collateral, with counterparties. If we enter into derivative instruments that require cash collateral and commodity prices change in a manner adverse to us, our cash otherwise available for use in our operations would be reduced, which could limit our ability to make future capital expenditures and make payments on our indebtedness, and which could also limit the size of our borrowing base. Future collateral requirements will depend on arrangements with our counterparties, highly volatile oil and natural gas prices and interest rates.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the estimated fair value of our commodity derivative contracts was a net liability of approximately $42.2 million. Any default by the counterparties to these derivative contracts when they become due may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our actual future production may be significantly higher or lower than we estimate at the time we enter into commodity derivative contracts for such period. If the actual amount is higher than we estimate, we will have greater commodity price exposure than we projected. If the actual amount is lower than the notional amount of our commodity derivative contracts, we might be forced to satisfy all or a portion of our commodity derivative contracts without the benefit of the cash flow from our sale or purchase of the underlying physical commodity, substantially diminishing our liquidity. There may be a change in the expected differential between the underlying commodity price in the commodity derivative contract and the actual price received, which may result in payments to our derivative counterparty that are not offset by our receipt of payments for our production in the field.\nOur exploitation, development and exploration projects require substantial capital expenditures. We may be unable to obtain required capital or financing on satisfactory terms, which could lead to a decline in our ability to access or grow reserves.\nOur business is capital intensive. We make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures for the exploitation, development and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves.\nWe expect to fund 2018 capital expenditures with cash generated by operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, as amended and restated (\u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d), our cash balance at year-end, and possibly offerings of our debt and equity securities. These funding methods could adversely impact our financial condition through increased leveraged or debt with restrictive covenants. Additional financing also may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. In the event additional capital resources are unavailable, we may curtail drilling, development and other activities, which in turn could lead to a decline in our reserves and production or require us to sell some of our assets on an untimely or unfavorable basis.\nOur cash flow from operations and access to other capital to finance our exploitation, development and exploration of near-term wells and our identified drilling locations over many years are subject to a number of variables, including:\n\u2022\nthe prices at which our production is sold;\n\u2022\nthe level of hydrocarbons we are able to produce from existing wells;\n\u2022\nour proved reserves;\n\u2022\nour ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves;\n\u2022\nthe levels of our operating expenses;\n\u2022\nour ability to borrow under our Revolving Credit Facility and our ability to access the capital markets; and\n\u2022\nthe scope, rate of progress and cost of our exploration, appraisal and development activities.\nPart of our strategy involves using some of the latest available horizontal drilling and completion techniques, which involve risks and uncertainties in their application.\nOur operations involve utilizing some of the latest drilling and completion techniques as developed by us and our service providers. Risks that we face while drilling horizontal wells include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nlanding our wellbore in the desired drilling zone;\n\u2022\nstaying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation;\n\u2022\nrunning our casing the entire length of the wellbore;\n\u2022\nbeing able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal wellbore; and\n\u2022\neffectively controlling the level of pressure flowing from particular wells.\nRisks that we face while completing our wells include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nthe ability to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages;\n\u2022\nthe ability to run tools the entire length of the wellbore during completion operations; and\n\u2022\nthe ability to successfully clean out the wellbore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage.\nIn addition, certain of the new techniques we are adopting may cause irregularities or interruptions in production due to offset wells being shut in and the time required to drill and complete multiple wells before any such wells begin producing. Furthermore, the results of our drilling in new or emerging formations are initially more uncertain than drilling results in areas that are more developed and have a longer history of established production. Newer or emerging formations and areas have limited or no production history and, consequently, we are more limited in assessing future drilling results in these areas. If our\ndrilling results are less than anticipated, the return on our investment for a particular project may not be as attractive as we anticipated, and we could incur material write-downs of unevaluated properties, and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future.\nDrilling for and producing oil and natural gas are high-risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur future financial condition and results of operations will depend on the success of our exploitation, development and acquisition activities, which are subject to numerous risks beyond our control, including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable oil and natural gas production.\nOur decisions to purchase, explore, develop or otherwise exploit prospects or properties will depend, in part, on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses, production data and engineering studies, the results of which are often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations. In addition, our cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain before drilling commences.\nFurther, many factors may curtail, delay or cancel our scheduled drilling projects, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\ndelays imposed by or resulting from compliance with regulatory requirements including limitations resulting from wastewater disposal, discharge of GHGs and limitations on hydraulic fracturing;\n\u2022\npressure or irregularities in geological formations;\n\u2022\nshortages of or delays in obtaining equipment and qualified personnel or in obtaining water for hydraulic fracturing activities;\n\u2022\nequipment failures, accidents or other unexpected operational events;\n\u2022\nlack of available gathering facilities or delays in construction of gathering facilities;\n\u2022\nlack of available capacity on interconnecting transmission pipelines;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions;\n\u2022\nissues related to compliance with environmental regulations;\n\u2022\nenvironmental hazards, such as oil and natural gas leaks, oil spills, pipeline and tank ruptures and unauthorized discharges of brine, well stimulation and completion fluids, toxic gases or other pollutants into the surface and subsurface environment;\n\u2022\ndeclines in oil and natural gas prices;\n\u2022\nlimited availability of financing at acceptable terms;\n\u2022\nloss of title or other title problems;\n\u2022\nlimitations in the market for oil and natural gas; and\n\u2022\noil, NGLs or natural gas gathering, transportation and processing availability restrictions or limitations.\nWe contract with third parties to conduct drilling and related services on our development projects and exploration prospects for us. Such third parties may not perform the services they provide us on schedule or within budget. Furthermore, the drilling equipment, facilities and infrastructure owned and operated by the third parties we contract with is highly complex and subject to malfunction and breakdown. Any malfunctions or breakdowns may be outside our control and result in delays, which could be substantial. Any delays in our drilling program caused by equipment, facility or equipment malfunction or breakdown could materially increase our costs of drilling and adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.\nReserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\nThe process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex. It requires interpretations of available technical data and many assumptions, including assumptions relating to current and future economic conditions and commodity prices. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves.\nIn order to prepare reserve estimates, we must project production rates and timing of development expenditures. We must also analyze available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data. The extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary. The process also requires economic assumptions about matters such as oil, NGLs and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds.\nActual future production, oil and natural gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves may vary from our estimates. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves. For instance, initial production rates reported by us or other operators may not be indicative of future or long-term production rates. In addition, stated recovery efficiencies may vary from projected rates and production declines may deviate from current estimates and may be more rapid and irregular when compared to initial production rates. We may also adjust reserve estimates to reflect additional production history, results of exploration and development activities, current commodity prices and other existing factors.\nYou should not assume that the present value of future net revenues from our reserves is the current market value of our estimated reserves. We generally base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the present value estimate.\nThe loss of senior management or technical personnel could adversely affect operations.\nWe depend on the services of our senior management and technical personnel. We do not maintain, nor do we plan to obtain, any insurance against the loss of any of these individuals. The loss of the services of our senior management or technical personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations are substantially dependent on the availability of water and sand, which may be hard or expensive to obtain.\nWater and sand are essential components of deep shale oil and natural gas production processes. Our ability to obtain water and sand for our operations may be affected by the price of water and sand, the availability of transportation and other market conditions. Additionally, some governmental authorities have restricted the use of water subject to their jurisdiction for hydraulic fracturing to protect local water supplies. Other regulations may restrict our ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of waste, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of oil and natural gas. Furthermore, future environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal, storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells could increase operating costs and cause delays, interruptions or termination of operations, which could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial performance. If we are unable to obtain water or sand to use in our operations, we may be unable to economically produce oil and natural gas, which could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur producing properties are located in the Permian Basin of West Texas, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in one major geographic area and reducing our realized price of oil.\nAll of our producing properties are geographically concentrated in the Permian Basin of West Texas. At December 31, 2017, all of our total estimated proved reserves were attributable to properties located in this area. As a result of this concentration, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors, delays or interruptions of production from wells in this area caused by governmental regulation, processing or transportation capacity constraints, market limitations, availability of equipment and personnel, water shortages or other drought related conditions or interruption of the processing or transportation of oil, NGLs or natural gas.\nIn addition, all of our oil contracts are impacted by the Midland-Cushing price differential, which reflects the difference between the price of crude at Midland, Texas, versus the price of crude at Cushing, Oklahoma, a major hub where production from Midland is often transported via pipeline. The price we currently realize on barrels of oil we sell is reduced by the value of the Midland-Cushing differential, which from 2014 to 2017 reached as high as $2.75 per barrel on August 13, 2015 and as low\nas negative $21.00 per barrel on August 19, 2014. If the Midland-Cushing differential, or other price differentials pursuant to which our production is subject, were to widen due to oversupply or other factors, our revenue could be negatively impacted.\nThe marketability of our production is dependent upon transportation and other facilities, certain of which we do not control. If these facilities are unavailable or become more costly, our operations could be interrupted and our revenues reduced.\nThe marketability of our oil and natural gas production depends in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of transportation facilities owned by third parties. Our oil production is transported from the wellhead to our tank batteries by our own gathering systems as well as third party gathering systems. Our purchasers then transport the oil by truck or pipeline. Our natural gas production is generally transported by gathering lines from the wellhead to a gas processing facility. We do not control these trucks and other third party transportation facilities and our access to them may be limited or denied. Insufficient production from our wells to support the construction of pipeline facilities by our purchasers or a significant disruption in the availability of our or third party transportation facilities, or other production facilities, could adversely impact our ability to deliver to market or produce our oil and natural gas and thereby cause a significant interruption in our operations. If, in the future, we are unable, for any sustained period, to implement acceptable delivery or transportation arrangements or encounter production related difficulties, we may be required to shut in or curtail production. Any such shut in or curtailment, or an increase in cost for delivery of the oil and natural gas produced from our fields, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may incur losses as a result of title defects.\nThe existence of a material title deficiency can render a lease worthless and can adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. While we typically obtain title opinions prior to commencing drilling operations on a lease or in a unit, the failure of title may not be discovered until after a well is drilled, in which case we may lose the lease and the right to produce all or a portion of the minerals under the property.\nThe development of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves \u201cPUDs\u201d may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate. Therefore, our estimated PUDs may not be ultimately developed or produced.\nAs of December 31, 2017, 58% of our total estimated proved reserves were classified as proved undeveloped. Development of these undeveloped reserves may take longer and require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate. Delays in the development of our reserves, increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves or decreases in commodity prices will reduce the value of our estimated PUDs and future net revenues estimated for such reserves and may result in some projects becoming uneconomic. In addition, delays in the development of reserves could cause us to have to reclassify our PUDs as unproved reserves. Further, we may be required to write down our PUDs if we do not drill those wells within five years after their respective dates of booking.\nIf commodity prices decrease to a level such that our future undiscounted cash flows from our properties are less than their carrying value for a significant period of time, we will be required to take write-downs of the carrying values of our properties.\nAccounting rules require that we periodically review the carrying value of our properties for possible impairment. Based on specific market factors and circumstances at the time of prospective impairment reviews, and the continuing evaluation of development plans, production data, economics and other factors, we may be required to write down the carrying value of our properties. A write-down constitutes a non-cash charge to earnings. We may incur impairment charges in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the periods in which such charges are taken.\nWe periodically assess our unproved oil and natural gas properties for impairment and could be required to recognize non-cash charges to earnings in future periods.\nAt December 31, 2017, our unproved property costs totaled $2.9 billion. Unproved property costs are assessed quarterly for potential impairment and when industry conditions dictate an impairment may be possible. Our assessment considers lease expirations, future drilling and exploration plans, results of exploration activities and commodity price outlooks. Based on our assessments, we may determine that we are unable to fully recover the cost invested in each project, and we will recognize non-cash charges to earnings in future periods if such determination is made.\nConservation measures and technological advances could reduce demand for oil and natural gas.\nFuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, tax advantages and other subsidies to support alternative energy sources, increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas, technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices could reduce demand for oil and natural gas. The impact of the changing demand for oil and natural gas may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe depend upon several significant purchasers for the sale of most of our oil, NGLs and natural gas production.\nDomestic and global economic conditions, especially in the energy industry, are volatile and there is the possibility that lenders could react by tightening credit. These conditions and factors may adversely affect the ability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us from time to time and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us, as well as their ability to access the credit and capital markets for such purposes.\nMoreover, our contractual counterparties may be unable to satisfy their contractual obligations to us due to the volatile market or other reasons. If a counterparty is unable to satisfy its contractual obligation to purchase oil, NGLs or natural gas from us, we may be unable to sell such production to another customer on terms we consider acceptable. Furthermore, the inability of our contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us and third parties may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur operations may be exposed to significant delays, costs and liabilities as a result of environmental and occupational health and safety requirements applicable to our business activities.\nOur operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment, worker health and safety aspects of our operations, or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations on our operations including the acquisition of a permit before conducting regulated drilling activities; the restriction of types, quantities and concentration of materials that can be released into the environment; the limitation or prohibition of drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; the application of specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection; and the imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations. Numerous governmental authorities, such as the EPA and analogous state agencies, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them. Such enforcement actions often involve taking difficult and costly compliance measures or corrective actions. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil or criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations, and the issuance of orders limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations. In addition, we may experience delays in obtaining, or be unable to obtain, required permits, which may delay or interrupt our operations and limit our growth and revenue.\nCertain environmental laws impose strict as well as joint and several liability for costs required to remediate and restore sites where hazardous substances, hydrocarbons, or solid wastes have been stored or released. We may be required to remediate contaminated properties currently or formerly operated by us or facilities of third parties that received waste generated by our operations regardless of whether such contamination resulted from the conduct of others or from consequences of our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. In connection with certain acquisitions, we could acquire, or be required to provide indemnification against, environmental liabilities that could expose us to material losses.\nWe may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of our operations. Additionally, we may not be insured for, or our insurance may be inadequate to protect us against, these risks.\nWe are not insured against all risks. Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured and underinsured events could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur exploration and production activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil and natural gas.\nAny of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial loss to us as a result of claims for:\n\u2022\ninjury or loss of life;\n\u2022\ndamage to and destruction of property, natural resources and equipment;\n\u2022\npollution and other environmental damage;\n\u2022\nregulatory investigations and penalties;\n\u2022\nsuspension of our operations; and\n\u2022\nrepair and remediation costs.\nWe may elect not to obtain insurance for any or all of these risks if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. The occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe must replace production but properties that we decide to drill may not yield oil or natural gas in commercially viable quantities.\nProducing oil and natural gas reservoirs are generally characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Unless we conduct successful ongoing exploitation, development and exploration activities or continually acquire properties containing proved reserves, our proved reserves will decline as those reserves are produced. Our future reserves and production, and therefore our future cash flow and results of operations, are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing and exploiting our current reserve base and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. We may not be able to develop, exploit, find or acquire sufficient additional reserves to replace our current and future production. If we are unable to replace our current and future production, the value of our reserves will decrease, and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nThere is no way to predict in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular prospect will yield oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to recover drilling or completion costs or to be economically viable, if at all. We cannot assure you that the analogies we draw from available data from other wells, more fully explored prospects or producing fields will be applicable to our drilling prospects. In addition, the use of micro-seismic data and other technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area will not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present or, if present, whether oil or natural gas will be present in commercial quantities. Even when properly used and interpreted, 2-D and 3-D seismic data and visualization techniques are only tools used to assist geoscientists in identifying subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators and do not enable the interpreter to know whether hydrocarbons are, in fact, present in those structures. In addition, the use of 3-D seismic and other advanced technologies requires greater predrilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies, and we could incur losses as a result of such expenditures.\nFurther, our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nunexpected drilling conditions;\n\u2022\ntitle problems;\n\u2022\npressure or lost circulation in formations;\n\u2022\nequipment failure or accidents;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions;\n\u2022\ncompliance with environmental and other governmental or contractual requirements; and\n\u2022\nincrease in the cost of, shortages or delays in the availability of, electricity, supplies, materials, drilling or workover rigs, equipment and services.\nAs a result, our drilling activities may not be successful or economical.\nWe may be unable to make attractive acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired businesses or assets, and any inability to do so may disrupt our business and hinder our ability to grow.\nFrom time to time, we may make acquisitions of assets or businesses that complement or expand our current business. However, there is no guarantee we will be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities. In the event we are able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities, we may be unable to complete the acquisitions, or do so on commercially acceptable terms. Competition for acquisitions may also increase the cost of, or cause us to refrain from, successfully completing acquisitions.\nThe success of any completed acquisition will depend on our ability to effectively integrate the acquired business into our existing operations. The process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managerial and financial resources. No assurance can be given that we will be able to identify additional suitable acquisition opportunities, negotiate acceptable terms, obtain financing for acquisitions on acceptable terms or successfully acquire identified targets. Our failure to achieve consolidation savings, to integrate the acquired businesses and assets into our existing operations successfully or to minimize any unforeseen operational difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our Revolving Credit Facility, the indenture governing our 6.625% senior notes due 2022 (\u201c2022 Senior Notes\u201d) and the indenture governing our 5.25% senior notes due 2025 (\u201c2025 Senior Notes\u201d, and collectively, the \u201csenior notes\u201d) impose certain limitations on our ability to enter into mergers or combination transactions. Our Revolving Credit Facility and the indentures also limit our ability to incur certain indebtedness, which could indirectly limit our ability to engage in acquisitions of businesses. If we desire to engage in an acquisition that is otherwise prohibited by our Revolving Credit Facility or the indentures governing our senior notes, we will be required to seek the consent of our lenders or the holders of the senior notes in accordance with the requirements of the credit facility or the indentures, which consent may be withheld by the lenders under our Revolving Credit Facility or such holders of senior notes at their sole discretion.\nAny acquisition we complete is subject to risks that could adversely affect our business, including the risk that our acquisitions may prove to be worth less than what we paid because of uncertainties in evaluating recoverable reserves and could expose us to potentially significant liabilities.\nWe have obtained a significant portion of our current reserve base through acquisitions of producing properties and undeveloped acreage. The success of any acquisition involves potential risks, including among other things:\n\u2022\nthe inability to estimate accurately the costs to develop the reserves, recoverable volumes of reserves, rates of future production and future net cash flows attainable from the reserves;\n\u2022\nthe assumption of unknown liabilities, including environmental liabilities, and losses or costs for which the Company is not indemnified or for which the indemnity the Company receives is inadequate;\n\u2022\nthe effect on our liquidity or financial leverage of using available cash or debt to finance acquisitions; and\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns.\nSuccessful acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties require an assessment of a number of factors, including estimates of recoverable reserves, the timing of recovering reserves, exploration potential, future commodity prices, operating costs and potential environmental, regulatory and other liabilities. Such assessments are inexact, and we cannot make these assessments with a high degree of accuracy. In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems, such as groundwater contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. There may be threatened, contemplated, asserted or other claims against the acquired assets related to environmental, title, regulatory, tax, contract, litigation, accounting or other matters of which we are unaware, which could materially and adversely affect our production, revenues and results of operations. Even when problems are identified, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems. We often are not entitled to contractual indemnification for environmental liabilities and acquire properties on an \u201cas is\u201d basis.\nWe could experience periods of higher costs if commodity prices rise. These increases could reduce our profitability, cash flow and ability to complete development activities as planned.\nHistorically, our capital and operating costs have risen during periods of increasing oil, natural gas and NGLs prices. These cost increases result from a variety of factors beyond our control, such as increases in the cost of electricity, steel and other raw materials that we and our vendors rely upon and increased demand for labor, services and materials as drilling activity increases. Decreased levels of drilling activity in the oil and natural gas industry in recent periods have led to declining costs of some drilling equipment, materials and supplies. However, such costs may rise quickly if commodity prices, thereby negatively impacting our profitability, cash flow and ability to complete development activities as scheduled and on budget.\nCertain of our properties are subject to land use restrictions, which could limit the manner in which we conduct our business.\nCertain of our properties are subject to land use restrictions, including city ordinances, which could limit the manner in which we conduct our business. These land use restrictions could affect, among other things, our access to and the permissible uses of our facilities as well as the manner in which we produce oil and natural gas and may restrict or prohibit drilling in general. The costs we incur to comply with such restrictions may be significant in nature, and we may experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities and perhaps even be precluded from the drilling of wells.\nThe unavailability of additional drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel and oilfield services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans within our budget and on a timely basis.\nThe demand for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations, geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with oil and natural gas prices, causing periodic shortages both in high and low price environments. Historically, there have been shortages of drilling and workover rigs, pipe and other equipment as demand for rigs and equipment has increased along with the number of wells being drilled. Additionally, during periods of low prices, the labor pool may be reduced and equipment retired, causing shortages when activity levels pick up. We cannot predict whether these conditions will exist in the future and, if so, what their timing and duration will be. If we are unable to secure a sufficient number of drilling rigs at reasonable costs, we may not be able to drill all of our acreage before our leases expire. Equipment shortages could delay or cause us to incur significant expenditures that are not provided for in our capital budget, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business depends in part on pipelines, transportation and gathering systems and processing facilities owned by others. Any limitation in the availability of those facilities could interfere with our ability to market our oil, natural gas and NGLs production and could harm our business. In particular, the marketability of our oil, natural gas and NGLs production depends in part on the availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines and other transportation methods, such as trucks, gathering systems and processing facilities owned by third parties. The amount of oil, natural gas and NGLs that can be produced and sold is subject to curtailment in certain circumstances, such as pipeline interruptions due to scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, excessive pressure, physical damage or lack of contracted capacity on such systems. Also, the transfer of our oil, natural gas and NGLs on third party pipelines may be curtailed or delayed if it does not meet the quality specifications of the pipeline owners. Our access to transportation options, including trucks owned by third parties, can also be affected by U.S. federal and state regulation of oil and gas production and transportation, general economic conditions and changes in supply and demand. The curtailments arising from these and similar circumstances may last from a few days to several months. In many cases, we are provided only with limited, if any, notice as to when these circumstances will arise and their duration. Any significant curtailment in gathering system or transportation or processing facility capacity could reduce our ability to market our oil, natural gas and NGLs production and harm our business.\nShould we fail to comply with all applicable FERC administered statutes, rules, regulations and orders, we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines.\nUnder the EPAct, the FERC has civil penalty authority under the NGA and the Natural Gas Policy Act to impose penalties for current violations of up to $1,213,503 per day for each violation and disgorgement of profits associated with any violation. We believe our operations are exempt from regulation by FERC as a natural gas gathering and exploration company under the NGA. However, FERC has adopted regulations that may subject certain of our otherwise non-FERC jurisdictional operations to FERC annual reporting and posting requirements. In addition, we must comply with the anti-market manipulation rules and transparency rules and regulations enforced by FERC. FERC actively pursues anti-manipulation matters and has successfully upheld its actions in Federal Courts, and these enforcement actions may result in significant financial penalties or settlement\npayments. Also, additional policies, rules and legislation pertaining to those and other matters may be considered or adopted by FERC, Congress and the Courts from time to time. Failure to comply with FERC\u2019s regulatory requirements in the future could subject us to civil penalty liability, as described in \u201cPart I. Item 1. Business-Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry.\u201d\nClimate change laws and regulations could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce while potential physical effects of climate change could disrupt our production and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects.\nIn response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act that, among other things, limit tailpipe emissions from motor vehicles and require preconstruction and operating permits for certain large stationary sources. Facilities required to obtain preconstruction permits for their GHG emissions must meet \u201cbest available control technology\u201d standards that will be established by the states or, in some cases, by the EPA on a case-by-case basis. These EPA rulemakings could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified sources. In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources in the United States, as well as onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production sources, on an annual basis, which include certain of our operations. Recent federal regulatory action with respect to climate change has focused on methane emissions. In 2016, the EPA finalized new air emission control requirements for emissions of methane from certain equipment and processes in the oil and natural gas source category, including production, processing, transmission and storage activities. The final rule package includes first-time standards to address emissions of methane from equipment and processes across the source category, including hydraulically fractured oil and natural gas well completions, and also imposes leak detection and repair requirements on operators. The BLM adopted similar rules in January 2017 that limit methane emissions from new and existing oil and gas operations on federal lands through limitations on the venting and flaring of gas, as well as enhanced leak detection and repair requirements. Operators generally had one year from rule\u2019s effective date to come into compliance with the rule\u2019s requirements. However, in December 2017, the BLM temporarily suspended or delayed certain of these requirements set forth in its Venting and Flaring Rule until January 2019, pending administrate review of the rule.\nIn the absence of additional federal climate legislation and the scaling back of environmental regulations under President Trump, a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking and/or reducing GHG emissions by means of cap and trade programs. These programs typically require major sources of GHG emissions to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those GHGs. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year in an effort to achieve the overall GHG emission reduction goal. In addition, in 2015, the United States participated in the United Nations Conference on Climate Change, which led to the creation of the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement requires countries to review and \u201crepresent a progression\u201d in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set GHG emission reduction goals, every five years beginning in 2020. However, in June 2017, President Trump announced that the United States plans to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and to seek negotiations either to reenter the Paris Agreement on different terms or establish a new framework agreement. The Paris Agreement provides for a four-year exit process beginning in November 2016, which would result in an effective exit date of November 2020. The United States\u2019 adherence to the exit process and/or the terms on which the United States may reenter the Paris Agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time.\nAlthough it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations. Substantial limitations on GHG emissions could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas we produce. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of GHGs could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. It should also be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events; if any such effects were to occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our exploration and production operations.\nFinally, increasing attention to the risks of climate change has resulted in an increased possibility of lawsuits brought by public and private entities against oil and gas companies in connection with their GHGs. Should we be targeted by any such litigation, we may incur liability, which, to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved, could be imposed without regard to the company\u2019s causation of or contribution to the asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors.\nFederal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing as well as governmental reviews of such activities could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and natural gas wells and adversely affect our production.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of oil and/or natural gas from dense subsurface rock formations. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into targeted subsurface formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. We regularly use hydraulic fracturing as part of our operations. Hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions, but the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the SDWA over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuels and published permitting guidance in February 2014 addressing the performance of such activities using diesel fuels. Also, in May 2014, the EPA issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, seeking comment on the development of regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. Congress has from time to time considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. It is unclear how any federal disclosure requirements that add to any applicable state disclosure requirements already in effect may affect our operations.\nWe may be subject to regulations that restrict our ability to discharge water produced as part of our production operations, and the ability to use injection wells as a disposal option not only will depend on federal or state regulations but also on whether available injection wells have sufficient storage capacities. In June 2016, the EPA issued a final rule banning the disposal of wastewater from unconventional oil and gas wells to public wastewater and sewage treatment plants. Produced and other flowback water from our current operations in the Permian Basin is typically not discharged to wastewater treatment plants but is re-injected into underground formations that do not contain potable water.\nFurther, the EPA has promulgated final rules that subject all oil and natural gas operations (production, processing, transmission, storage and distribution) to regulation under the NSPS and NESHAPS programs. These rules include NSPS standards for completions of hydraulically-fractured gas wells. The standards include the reduced emission completion techniques developed in the EPA\u2019s Natural Gas STAR program along with pit flaring of gas not sent to the gathering line. The standards are applicable to newly drilled and fractured wells and wells that are refractured. Further, the rules under NESHAPS include Maximum Achievable Control Technology (\u201cMACT\u201d) for glycol dehydrators and storage vessels at major source of hazardous air pollutants not currently subject to MACT standards. On May 12, 2016, the EPA issued three additional rules for the oil and gas industry to reduce emissions of methane, VOCs and other compounds. These rules apply to all new, reconstructed, and modified processes and equipment since September 2015. Among other things, the new rules impose green completion requirements on new hydraulically fractured oil wells and reduce allowable emissions of methane and VOCs. In June 2017, the EPA proposed a two year stay of the fugitive emissions monitoring requirements, pneumatic pump standards, and closed vent system certification requirements in the 2016 New Source Performance Standards rule for the oil and gas industry while it reconsiders these aspects of the rule. The proposal is still under consideration.\nAt the state level, several states have adopted or are considering legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. For example, the Texas Railroad Commission has issued a \u201cwell integrity rule,\u201d that includes requirements, such as (i) the requirement to submit cementing reports after well completion or after cessation of drilling, whichever is later, and (ii) the imposition of additional testing on wells less than 1,000 feet below usable groundwater. In 2013, the Texas Railroad Commission implemented its hydraulic fracturing disclosure rule, which requires oil and gas operators to disclose on the FracFocus website the chemical ingredients and water volumes used in hydraulic fracturing treatments. Local governments also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general or hydraulic fracturing in particular. If new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.\nCompetition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, making it more difficult for us to acquire properties, market oil or natural gas, and secure and maintain trained personnel.\nOur ability to acquire additional prospects and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties, market oil and natural gas and secure and maintain trained personnel. Also, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and natural gas industry. Our competitors may be able to pay more for productive properties and exploratory prospects and to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our\nfinancial or personnel resources permit. In addition, other companies may be able to offer better compensation packages to attract and retain qualified personnel than we are able to offer. Such competitors may also be in a better position to secure oilfield services and equipment on a timely basis or on favorable terms. These companies may have a greater ability to continue drilling activities during periods of low oil and gas prices, such as the current commodity price environment, and to absorb the burden of current and future governmental regulations and taxation. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future in acquiring prospective reserves, developing reserves, marketing hydrocarbons, attracting and retaining quality personnel and raising additional capital, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAdverse weather conditions may negatively affect our operating results and our ability to conduct drilling activities.\nAdverse weather conditions may cause, among other things, increases in the costs of, and delays in, drilling or completing new wells, power failures, temporary shut-in of production and difficulties in the transportation of our oil, NGLs and natural gas. Any decreases in production due to poor weather conditions will have an adverse effect on our revenues, which will in turn negatively affect our cash flow from operations.\nWe are susceptible to the potential difficulties associated with rapid growth and expansion.\nWe have grown rapidly over the last several years. Our management believes that our future success depends on our ability to manage the rapid growth that we have experienced and the demands from increased responsibility on management personnel. The following factors could present difficulties:\n\u2022\nincreased responsibilities for our executive level personnel;\n\u2022\nincreased administrative burden;\n\u2022\nincreased capital requirements; and\n\u2022\nincreased organizational challenges common to large, expansive operations.\nOur operating results could be adversely affected if we do not successfully manage these potential difficulties. The historical financial information incorporated herein is not necessarily indicative of the results that may be realized in the future.\nIncreases in the cost of capital could adversely affect our business.\nOur business and operating results can be harmed by factors such as the availability, terms of and cost of capital, increases in interest rates or a reduction in credit rating. These changes could cause our cost of doing business to increase, limit our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities, reduce cash flow used for drilling and place us at a competitive disadvantage. Volatility, negative or uncertain economic and political conditions in our significant markets could undermine business confidence and may lead to a contraction in credit availability impacting our ability to finance our operations. We require continued access to capital. A significant reduction in cash flows from operations or the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve our planned growth and operating results.\nRecently enacted legislation will affect our tax position, and one day, certain federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development may be eliminated, and additional state taxes on oil and natural gas extraction may be imposed, as a result of future legislation.\nIn December 2017, Congress enacted the budget reconciliation act commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTax Act\u201d). The law made significant changes to U.S. federal income tax laws, including reducing the corporate income tax rate to 21%, repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax (\u201cAMT\u201d), partially limiting the deductibility of interest expense and net operating losses, eliminating the deduction for certain U.S. production activities, and allowing the immediate deduction of certain new investments in lieu of depreciation expense over time. As a result of the Tax Act, we recorded a one-time, non-cash adjustment to the income tax provision of $144.4 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. The ultimate impact of the Tax Act on our reported results in fiscal 2018 and beyond may differ from the estimates provided herein, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made, guidance that may be issued, and other actions we may take as a result of the Tax Act.\nIn recent years, lawmakers and Treasury have proposed certain significant changes to U.S. tax laws applicable to oil and gas companies. These changes include, but are not limited to: (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties; (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs; and (iii) an\nextension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. Although these changes were not included in the Tax Act, it is unclear whether any such changes will be enacted or if enacted, when such changes could be effective. If such proposed changes are ever made, as well as any similar changes in state law, it could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available to us with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development, and any such change could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, future legislation could be enacted that increases the taxes or fees imposed on oil and natural gas extraction. Any such legislation could result in increased operating costs and/or reduced consumer demand for petroleum products, which in turn could affect the prices we receive for our oil, NGLs and natural gas.\nRestrictions on drilling activities intended to protect certain species of wildlife may adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in areas where we operate.\nOil and natural gas operations in our operating areas may be adversely affected by seasonal or permanent restrictions on drilling activities designed to protect various wildlife. Seasonal restrictions may limit our ability to operate in protected areas and can intensify competition for drilling rigs, oilfield equipment, services, supplies and qualified personnel, which may lead to periodic shortages when drilling is allowed. These constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay our operations or materially increase our operating and capital costs. Permanent restrictions imposed to protect endangered species could prohibit drilling in certain areas or require the implementation of expensive mitigation measures. The designation of previously unprotected species in areas where we operate as threatened or endangered could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our exploration and production activities that could have a material and adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce our reserves.\nDerivatives legislation and implementing rules could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price risk, interest rate risk and other risks associated with our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd Frank Act\u201d), enacted on July 21, 2010, established federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities, such as us, that participate in that market. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the CFTC and the SEC to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act. While some of these rules have been finalized, some have not been finalized. In October 2011, the CFTC issued regulations to set position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic equivalents; however, this initial position limits rule was vacated by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in September 2012. The CFTC has subsequently issued proposals for new rules that would place position limits on certain core futures contracts and equivalent swap contracts for or linked to certain physical commodities, subject to certain exceptions, though these rules have not been finalized. The CFTC has designated certain interest rate swaps and credit default swaps subject to mandatory clearing. The CFTC has not yet proposed rules designating any other classes of swaps, including physical commodity swaps, subject to mandatory clearing. The full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act and related regulatory requirements upon the Company\u2019s business will not be known until the regulations are implemented and the market for derivatives contracts has adjusted. When fully implemented, the Dodd-Frank Act and any new regulations could increase the operational and transactional cost of derivatives contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks the Company encounters, reduce the ability of the Company to monetize and restructure its existing derivatives contracts and affect the number and/or creditworthiness of available counterparties. If the Company reduces its use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations, the Company\u2019s results of operations may become more volatile and its cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures.\nWe may not be able to keep pace with technological developments in our industry.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies. As others use or develop new technologies, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or may be forced by competitive pressures to implement those new technologies at substantial costs. In addition, other oil and natural gas companies may have greater financial, technical and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and that may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we can. We may not be able to respond to these competitive pressures or implement new technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost. If one or more of the technologies we use now or in the future were to become obsolete, or if we are unable to use the most advanced commercially available technology, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are subject to certain requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If we fail to comply with the requirements of Section 404 or if we or our auditors identify and report material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, our investors may lose confidence in our reported information and our stock price may be negatively affected.\nWe are required to comply with certain provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Section 404 requires that we document and test our internal control over financial reporting and issue management\u2019s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. This section also requires that our independent registered public accounting firm opine on those internal controls. If we fail to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or if we or our auditors identify and report material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, the accuracy and timeliness of the filing of our annual and quarterly reports may be materially adversely affected and could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. In addition, a material weakness in the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could result in an increased chance of fraud and the loss of customers, reduce our ability to obtain financing and require additional expenditures to comply with these requirements, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAny significant reduction in our borrowing base under our Revolving Credit Facility as a result of the periodic borrowing base redeterminations, or otherwise, may negatively impact our ability to fund our operations.\nOur Revolving Credit Facility limits the amounts we can borrow up to a borrowing base amount, which the lenders, in their sole discretion, determine on a semi-annual basis based, among other things, upon projected revenues from, and asset values of, the oil and natural gas properties securing our loan. The lenders can unilaterally adjust the borrowing base and the borrowings permitted to be outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility. Any increase in the borrowing base requires the consent of the lenders holding 100% of the commitments. The borrowing base under our Revolving Credit Facility is currently $1.5 billion, with lender commitments of $2.5 billion.\nIn the future, we may not be able to access adequate funding under our Revolving Credit Facility as a result of a decrease in borrowing base due to the issuance of new indebtedness, the outcome of a subsequent borrowing base redetermination or an unwillingness or inability on the part of lending counterparties to meet their funding obligations and the inability of other lenders to provide additional funding to cover the defaulting lender\u2019s portion. Declines in commodity prices could result in the lenders\u2019 lowering the borrowing base. In such a case, we could be required to repay any indebtedness in excess of the redetermined borrowing base and revise our drilling plan to account for our access to less capital under our Revolving Credit Facility.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under applicable debt instruments, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our indebtedness obligations, including our Revolving Credit Facility and the senior notes, depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance indebtedness. Our ability to restructure or refinance indebtedness will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In the absence of sufficient cash flows and capital resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet debt service and other obligations. Our Revolving Credit Facility and indentures governing the senior notes currently restrict our ability to dispose of assets and our use of the proceeds from such disposition. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions, and the proceeds of any such disposition may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet scheduled debt service obligations.\nOur leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, business prospects and our ability to make payments on our debt obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $1.15 billion of senior unsecured notes outstanding, $1.9 million of letters of credit outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility, and $523.1 million of borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility. Our level of indebtedness could affect our operations in several ways, including the following:\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our existing debt, thereby reducing the cash available to finance our operations and other business activities;\n\u2022\nlimit management\u2019s discretion in operating our business and our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to downturns and adverse developments in our business and the economy generally;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to access the capital markets to raise capital on favorable terms or to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures or acquisitions or to refinance existing indebtedness;\n\u2022\nplace restrictions on our ability to obtain additional financing, make investments, lease equipment, sell assets and engage in business combinations;\n\u2022\nmake it more likely that a reduction in our borrowing base following a periodic redetermination could require us to repay a portion of our then-outstanding bank borrowings;\n\u2022\nmake us vulnerable to increases in interest rates as our indebtedness under our Revolving Credit Facility may vary with prevailing interest rates;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors with lower levels of indebtedness in relation to their overall size or less restrictive terms governing their indebtedness; and\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our debt instruments and increase the risk that we may default on our debt obligations.\nOur Revolving Credit Facility and the indentures governing the senior notes have restrictive covenants that could limit our growth, financial flexibility and our ability to engage in certain activities.\nOur Revolving Credit Facility and the indentures governing the senior notes have restrictive covenants that could limit our growth, financial flexibility and our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Our Revolving Credit Facility and the indentures governing the senior notes contain covenants, that, among other things, limit our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nmake loans to others;\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\nmerge or consolidate with another entity;\n\u2022\nmake dividends and certain other payments;\n\u2022\nhedge future production or interest rates;\n\u2022\nincur liens that secure indebtedness;\n\u2022\nsell assets;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nengage in certain other transactions without the prior consent of the lenders.\nIn addition, our Revolving Credit Facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios or to reduce our indebtedness if we are unable to comply with such ratios, which may limit our ability to obtain future financings to withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general, or to otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities. We may also be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of these limitations.\nIf we are unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness, there could be a default under the terms of these agreements, which could result in an acceleration of payment of funds that we have borrowed.\nOur ability to meet our debt obligations and other expenses will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors, many of which we are unable to control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow and are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest, or special interest, if any, on our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants, including financial and operating covenants, in the agreements governing our indebtedness, we could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness. In the event of such default:\n\u2022\nthe holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest;\n\u2022\nthe lenders under our Revolving Credit Facility could elect to terminate their commitments thereunder, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets; and\n\u2022\nwe could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nIf our operating performance declines, we may in the future need to obtain waivers under our Revolving Credit Facility to avoid being in default. If we breach our covenants under our Revolving Credit Facility and seek a waiver, we may not be able to obtain a waiver from the required lenders. If this occurs, we would be in default under our Revolving Credit Facility, the lenders could exercise their rights, as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nA downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital.\nWe receive debt credit ratings from Standard & Poor\u2019s Ratings Group, Inc. (\u201cS&P\u201d) and Moody\u2019s Investors Service, Inc. (\u201cMoody\u2019s\u201d), which are subject to regular reviews. S&P and Moody\u2019s consider many factors in determining our ratings including: production growth opportunities, liquidity, debt levels and asset and reserve mix.\nA downgrade in our credit ratings could negatively impact our cost of capital and our ability to effectively execute aspects of our strategy. Further, a downgrade in our credit ratings could affect our ability to raise debt in the public debt markets, and the cost of any new debt could be much higher than our outstanding debt. These and other impacts of a downgrade in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business could be negatively affected by security threats, including cybersecurity threats, and other disruptions.\nThe oil and natural gas industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations. For example, the industry depends on digital technologies to interpret seismic data, manage drilling rigs, production equipment and gathering systems, conduct reservoir modeling and reserves estimation, and process and record financial and operating data. At the same time, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks or unintentional events, have increased. Our technologies, systems, networks, and those of our business partners, may become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of business operations that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, and corruption of data. These events could damage the Company\u2019s reputation and lead to financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability.\nOther risk factors\nAdditional discussion of risks and uncertainties related to price and demand, litigation, environmental matters, oil and gas reserves estimation processes, impairments, derivatives, market risks and internal controls appear elsewhere in this report. The risks described in this report are not the only risks we face and other risks, including risks deemed immaterial, may have a material adverse effect on us, our financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 14408, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "RSPP"}
