Risk Factors\nAn investment in the Corporation's common stock is subject to risks inherent to the Corporation's business. Before making an investment, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report. This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Outbreak\nThe economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant economic dislocation in the United States as many state and local governments have placed restrictions on businesses. This resulted in an unprecedented slow-down in economic activity and a related increase in unemployment. During the COVID-19 outbreak, stock markets and the value of securities, in particular bank stocks, have experienced significant volatility. In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, the Federal Reserve reduced the benchmark fed funds rate to a target range of 0% to 0.25%, and the yields on 10- and 30-year treasury notes declined to historic lows. Various state governments and federal agencies are requiring lenders to provide forbearance and other relief to borrowers (e.g., waiving late payment and other fees). The federal banking agencies have encouraged financial institutions to prudently work with affected borrowers and passed legislation to provide relief from reporting loan classifications due to modifications related to the COVID-19 outbreak. Certain industries have been particularly hard-hit, including the travel and hospitality industry, the restaurant industry and the retail industry. Finally, the spread of the coronavirus has caused us to modify our business practices, including employee travel, employee work locations, and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences. We have many employees working remotely and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers and business partners.\nGiven its ongoing and dynamic nature, it is difficult to predict the full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on our business. The extent of such impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, including when the coronavirus can be controlled and abated. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related adverse local and national economic consequences, we could be subject to any of the following risks, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations:\n\u2022Demand for our products and services may decline, making it difficult to grow assets and income;\n\u2022If the economy is unable to remain open, and high levels of unemployment continue for an extended period of time, loan delinquencies, problem assets, and foreclosures may increase, resulting in increased charge-offs and reduced income;\n\u2022Collateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, which could cause loan losses to increase;\n\u2022Our allowance for credit losses on loans and leases may increase if borrowers experience financial difficulties, which will adversely affect our net income;\n\u2022The net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us;\n\u2022A further and sustained decline in our stock price or the occurrence of what management would deem to be a triggering event that could result in a goodwill or intangible impairment charge being recorded that would adversely impact our results of operations and the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to us;\n\u2022As a result of the decline in the Federal Reserve's target federal funds rate to near 0%, the yield on our assets may decline to a greater extent than the decline in our cost of interest-bearing liabilities, reducing our net interest margin and spread and reducing net income;\n\u2022A material decrease in net income or a net loss over several quarters could result in the elimination of or a decrease in the rate of our quarterly cash dividend;\n\u2022Our wealth management revenues may decline with continuing market turmoil;\n\u2022Our cyber security risks are increased as a result of an increase in the number of employees working remotely;\n\u2022We rely on third party vendors for certain services and the unavailability of a critical service due to the COVID-19 outbreak could have an adverse effect on us;\n\u2022Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation premiums may increase if the agency experiences additional resolution costs; and\n\u2022We face litigation, regulatory enforcement and reputation risk as a result of our participation in the PPP and the risk that the Small Business Administration (the \"SBA\") may not fund some or all PPP loan guaranties.\nMoreover, our future success and profitability substantially depends on the management skills of our executive officers and directors, many of whom have held officer and director positions with us for many years. The unanticipated loss or unavailability of key employees due to the outbreak could harm our ability to operate our business or execute our business strategy. We may not be successful in finding and integrating suitable successors in the event of key employee loss or unavailability.\nAny one or a combination of the factors identified above, or other factors, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe are subject to litigation, regulatory enforcement risk and reputation risk regarding the Bank's participation in the Paycheck Protection Program and the risk that the SBA may not fund some or all PPP loan guaranties.\nUnder the PPP, small businesses and other entities and individuals can apply for loans from existing SBA and other approved regulated lenders that enroll in the program, subject to detailed qualifications and eligibility criteria. The Bank, as participating lender, has originated approximately 2,550 loans under the PPP aggregating approximately $510 million through December 31, 2020.\nBecause of the short timeframe between the passing of the CARES Act and implementation of the PPP, some of the rules and guidance relating to PPP were issued after lenders began processing PPP applications. Also, there was and continues to be uncertainty in the laws, rules and guidance relating to the PPP. Since the opening of the PPP, several banks have been subject to litigation regarding the procedures used in processing PPP applications. In addition, some banks and borrowers have received negative media attention associated with PPP loans. Although we believe that we have administered the PPP in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations and guidance, we may be exposed to litigation risk and negative media attention regarding our participation in the PPP. If any such litigation is filed and is not resolved in our favor, it may result in significant financial liability to us or adversely affect our reputation. In addition, litigation can be costly, regardless of the outcome. Any financial liability, litigation costs or reputational damage caused by PPP-related litigation or media attention could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe PPP has also attracted interest from federal and state enforcement authorities, oversight agencies, regulators, and Congressional committees. State Attorneys General and other federal and state agencies may assert that they are not subject to the provisions of the CARES Act and the PPP regulations entitling the Bank to rely on borrower certifications, and take more aggressive action against the Bank for alleged violations of the provisions governing the Bank's participation in the PPP. Federal and state regulators can impose or request that we consent to substantial sanctions, restrictions and requirements if they determine there are violations of laws, rules or regulations or weaknesses or failures with respect to general standards of safety and soundness, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operation and financial condition.\nThe Bank also has credit risk on PPP loans if the SBA determines that there is a deficiency in the manner in which any loans were originated, funded or serviced by the Bank, including any issue with the eligibility of a borrower to receive a PPP loan. In the event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there was a deficiency in the manner in which the PPP loan was originated, funded or serviced by the Bank, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty or, if the SBA has already paid under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from the Bank.\nRisks Related to Market Interest Rates\nThe Corporation is subject to interest rate risk.\nOur profitability is dependent to a large extent on our net interest income. Like most financial institutions, we are affected by changes in general interest rate levels and by other economic factors beyond our control. Changes in interest rates influence not only the interest we receive on loans and investment securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and\nborrowings, but such changes could also affect our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits and the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities. Although we have implemented strategies to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on our results of operations, any substantial and prolonged change in market interest rates could adversely affect our operating results.\nNet interest income may decline in a particular period if:\n\u2022in a declining interest rate environment, more interest-earning assets than interest-bearing liabilities re-price or mature, or\n\u2022in a rising interest rate environment, more interest-bearing liabilities than interest-earning assets re-price or mature.\nOur net interest income may decline based on our exposure to a difference in short-term and long-term interest rates. If the difference between the short-term and long-term interest rates continue to shrink or disappears, the difference between rates paid on deposits and received on loans could narrow significantly resulting in a decrease in net interest income. In addition to these factors, if market interest rates rise rapidly, interest rate adjustment caps may limit increases in the interest rates on adjustable rate loans, thus reducing our net interest income. Also, certain adjustable rate loans re-price based on lagging interest rate indices. This lagging effect may also negatively impact our net interest income when general interest rates continue to rise periodically. Increasing interest rates may also reduce the fair value of our fixed rate available-for-sale investment securities negatively impacting shareholders' equity.\nRisks Related to Our Lending Activities\nThe Corporation is subject to lending risk.\nRisks associated with lending activities include, among other things, the impact of changes in interest rates and economic conditions, which may adversely impact the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans and the value of the associated collateral. Various laws and regulations also affect our lending activities, and failure to comply with such applicable laws and regulations could subject the Corporation to enforcement actions and civil monetary penalties.\nAt December 31, 2020, approximately 78.0% of our loan and lease portfolio, excluding PPP loans, consisted of commercial, financial and agricultural, commercial real estate and construction loans and leases, which are generally perceived as having more risk of default than residential real estate and consumer loans. Commercial business, commercial real estate and construction loans are more susceptible to a risk of loss during a downturn in the business cycle. These types of loans involve larger loan balances to a single borrower or groups of related borrowers. Commercial real estate loans may be affected to a greater extent than residential loans by adverse conditions in real estate markets or the economy because commercial real estate borrowers' ability to repay their loans depends on successful development of their properties and the successful operation of the borrower's business, as well as the factors affecting residential real estate borrowers.\nLoans secured by properties where repayment is dependent upon payment of rent by third party tenants or the sale of the property may be impacted by loss of tenants, lower lease rates needed to attract new tenants or the inability to sell a completed project in a timely fashion and at a profit.\nCommercial business loans and leases are typically based on the borrowers' ability to repay the loans from the cash flows of their businesses. These loans may involve greater risk because the availability of funds to repay each loan depends substantially on the success of the business itself. The collateral securing the loans and leases often depreciates over time, is difficult to appraise and liquidate and fluctuates in value based on the success of the business. In addition, many commercial business loans have a variable rate that is indexed off of a floating rate such as the Prime Rate or LIBOR. If interest rates rise, the borrower's debt service requirement may increase, negatively impacting the borrower's ability to service their debt.\nRisk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon whether our initial estimate of the property's value at completion of construction equals or exceeds the cost of the property construction (including interest). During the construction phase, a number of factors can result in delays and cost overruns. If estimates of value are inaccurate or if actual construction costs exceed estimates, the value of the property securing the loan may be insufficient to ensure full repayment when completed. Included in real estate-construction is track development financing. Risk factors related to track development financing include diminishing demand for residential housing and decreases in real estate valuations. When projects move slower than anticipated, the properties may have significantly lower values than when the original underwriting was completed, resulting in lower collateral values to support the loan. Extended time frames also cause the interest carrying cost for projects to be higher than the builder projected, negatively impacting the builder's profit and cash flows and, therefore, their ability to make principal and interest payments.\nAn increase in nonperforming loans and leases from these types of loans could result in an increase in the provision for credit losses, loans and leases, and an increase in loan and lease charge-offs. The risk of credit losses on loans and leases increases if the economy worsens.\nThe Corporation's allowance for possible credit losses on loans and leases may be insufficient, and an increase in the allowance would reduce earnings.\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses on loans and leases. The allowance is established through a provision for credit losses on loans and leases based on management's evaluation of expected credit losses in our loan portfolio factoring in current and forecasted economic conditions. The allowance is based upon a number of factors, including the size and composition of the loan and lease portfolio, asset classifications, economic trends, industry experience and trends, industry and geographic concentrations, estimated collateral values, management's assessment of the current expected credit losses in the portfolio, historical loan and lease loss experience and loan underwriting policies. In addition, we evaluate all loans and leases identified as not sharing similar risk characteristics with other pooled loans individually analyzed and augment the allowance based upon our estimation of the potential loss associated with those individually analyzed loans and leases. Additions to our allowance for credit losses, loans and leases, decrease our net income.\nIf the evaluation we perform in connection with establishing loan and lease loss reserves is wrong, our allowance for credit losses, loans and leases, may not be sufficient to cover our losses, which would have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nThe regulators, in reviewing our loan and lease portfolio as part of a regulatory examination, may from time to time require us to increase our allowance for credit losses, loans and leases, thereby negatively affecting our earnings, financial condition and capital ratios at that time. Moreover, additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic and real estate market conditions, new information regarding existing loans and leases, identification of additional impaired loans and leases and other factors, both within and outside of our control. Additions to the allowance could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nChanges in economic conditions and the composition of our loan and lease portfolio could lead to higher loan charge-offs and/or an increase in our provision for credit losses, loans and leases, which may reduce our net income.\nChanges in national and regional economic conditions could impact our loan and lease portfolios. For example, an increase in unemployment, a decrease in real estate values or changes in interest rates, as well as other factors, could weaken the economies of the communities we serve. Weakness in the market areas we serve could depress our earnings as customers may not demand our products or services, borrowers may not be able to repay their loans, the value of the collateral securing our loans to borrowers may decline and the quality of our loan portfolio may decline. Any of these scenarios could require us to charge off loans which would result in an increase to our provision for credit losses on loans and leases, which would reduce our net income and capital levels.\nThe Corporation depends on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and counterparties, we rely on information furnished to us by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. We also rely on representations of customers and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. For example, in deciding whether to extend credit to clients, we may assume that a customer's audited financial statements conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the customer. Our earnings are significantly affected by our ability to properly originate, underwrite and service loans. Our financial condition, results of operations and capital could be negatively impacted to the extent we incorrectly assess the creditworthiness of our borrowers, fail to detect or respond to deterioration in asset quality in a timely manner, or rely on financial statements that do not comply with U.S. GAAP or are materially misleading.\nThe Corporation is subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities.\nIn the course of our business, we may foreclose and take title to real estate and could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. The Corporation may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination or the release of hazardous or toxic substances at a property. Our policies and procedures require environmental factors to be considered during the loan application process. An environmental review is performed before initiating any\ncommercial foreclosure action; however, these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. Possible remediation costs and liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nThe Corporation's controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented.\nOur management diligently reviews and updates the Corporation's internal controls over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any failure or undetected circumvention of these controls could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Corporation may not be able to attract and retain skilled people.\nWe are dependent on the ability and experience of a number of key management personnel who have substantial experience with our operations, the financial services industry, and the markets in which we offer products and services. The loss of one or more senior executives or key managers may have an adverse effect on our businesses. We maintain change in control agreements with certain executive officers to aid in our retention of these individuals. Our success depends on our ability to continue to attract, manage, and retain other qualified management personnel.\nIf we lose a significant portion of our low-cost deposits, it would negatively impact our liquidity and profitability.\nOur profitability depends in part on our success in attracting and retaining a stable base of low-cost deposits. At December 31, 2020, 32% of our deposit base was comprised of noninterest-bearing deposits, of which 22% consisted of business deposits, which are primarily operating accounts for businesses, and 10% consisted of consumer deposits. The competition for these deposits in our markets is strong and customers are increasingly seeking investments with higher interest rates that are safe, including the purchase of U.S. Treasury securities and other government-guaranteed obligations, as well as the establishment of accounts at the largest, most-well capitalized banks. If we were to lose a significant portion of our low-cost deposits, it would negatively impact our liquidity and profitability.\nThe Corporation's information technology systems and the systems of third parties upon which the Corporation relies may experience a failure, interruption or breach in security, which could negatively affect our operations and reputation.\nThe Corporation relies heavily on information technology systems, including the systems of third-party service providers, to conduct its business. Any failure, interruption, or breach in security or operational integrity of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in the Corporation's customer relationship management and general ledger, deposit, loan, and other systems. While the Corporation has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the impact of any failure, interruption, or breach in our security systems (including privacy and cyber-attacks), there can be no assurance that such events will not occur or if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. Information security and cyber-security risks have increased significantly in recent years because of new technologies, the use of the Internet and other electronic delivery channels (including mobile devices) to conduct financial transactions. Accordingly, the Corporation may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance its protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or exposures. The occurrence of any system failures, interruptions, or breaches in security could expose the Corporation to reputation risk, litigation, regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe failure to maintain current technologies and the costs to update technology could negatively impact the Corporation's business and financial results.\nOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to effectively embrace technology to better serve customers and reduce costs. The Corporation may be required to expand additional resources to employ the latest technologies. Failure to keep pace with technological change could potentially have an adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition and results of operations.\nWe borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank, the Federal Reserve and correspondent banks, and these lenders could modify or terminate their current programs, which could have an adverse effect on our liquidity and profitability.\nWe utilize the FHLB for overnight borrowings and term advances. We also borrow from the Federal Reserve and from correspondent banks under our federal funds lines of credit. The amount loaned to us is generally dependent on the value of the collateral pledged as well as the FHLB's internal credit rating of the Bank. These lenders could reduce the percentages loaned\nagainst various collateral categories, could eliminate certain types of collateral and could otherwise modify or even terminate their loan programs, particularly to the extent they are required to do so, because of capital adequacy or other balance sheet concerns. Any change or termination of our borrowings from the FHLB, the Federal Reserve or correspondent banks would have an adverse effect on our liquidity and profitability.\nOther Risks Related to Our Business\nUncertainty surrounding the future of LIBOR (London Interbank Offer Rate) may affect the fair value and return on the Corporation's financial instruments that use LIBOR as a reference rate.\nThe Corporation holds assets, liabilities, and derivatives that are indexed to the various tenors of LIBOR. The LIBOR yield curve is also utilized in our fair value calculations. The reform of major interest benchmarks led to the announcement that LIBOR would not be supported in its current form after June 30, 2023; however banking regulators have indicated that new contracts entered into before December 31, 2021, should either utilize a reference rate other than LIBOR or have robust fallback language that includes a clearly defined alternative reference rate after LIBOR\u2019s discontinuation. The Corporation believes the U.S. financial sector will maintain an orderly and smooth transition to new interest rate benchmarks of which the Corporation will evaluate and adopt if appropriate. While in the U.S., the Alternative Rates Committee of the FRB and Federal Reserve Bank of New York have identified the SOFR as an alternative U.S. dollar reference interest rate, it is too early to predict the financial impact this rate index replacement may have, if at all.\nOur results of operations may be adversely affected by credit losses relating to our investment portfolio.\nThe Corporation maintains an investment portfolio, including available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities. We may be required to record future charges to earnings if we determine a decline in fair value of these investments has resulted from credit losses or other factors. Numerous factors, including the lack of liquidity for resales of certain investment securities, the absence of reliable pricing information for investment securities, adverse changes in the business climate, adverse regulatory actions, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, unanticipated changes in the competitive environment, changes in market interest rates and limited investor demand, could have a negative effect on our investment portfolio. Credit loss charges could negatively impact our earnings and regulatory capital ratios.\nNatural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external events could negatively impact the Corporation.\nNatural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, the emergence of widespread health emergencies or pandemics and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on the Corporation's ability to conduct business. In addition, such events could affect the stability of the Corporation's deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause the Corporation to incur additional expenses. Our management has established disaster recovery policies and procedures that are expected to mitigate events related to natural or man-made disasters; however, the occurrence of any such event and the impact of an overall economic decline resulting from such a disaster could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Economic Conditions\nThe Corporation's earnings are impacted by general business and economic conditions.\nThe Corporation's operations and profitability are impacted by general business and economic conditions, including long-term and short-term interest rates, inflation, money supply, political issues, legislative, accounting and regulatory changes, fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets, broad trends in industry and finance, values of real estate and other collateral and the strength of the U.S. economy and the local economies in which we operate, all of which are beyond our control. Negative changes in these general business and economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Corporation's profitability is affected by economic conditions in Pennsylvania and New Jersey markets.\nUnlike larger regional banks that operate in large geographies, the Corporation provides banking and financial services to customers primarily in Bucks, Berks, Chester, Cumberland, Dauphin, Delaware, Lancaster, Lehigh, Montgomery, Northampton, Philadelphia and York counties in Pennsylvania and Atlantic and Cape May counties in New Jersey. Because of our geographic concentration, a downturn in the local economy could make it more difficult to attract loans and deposits, and could cause higher losses and delinquencies on our loans than if the loans were more geographically diversified. Adverse\neconomic conditions in the region, including, without limitation, declining real estate values or higher unemployment, could cause our levels of nonperforming assets and loan losses to increase. Regional economic conditions have a significant impact on the ability of borrowers to repay their loans as scheduled. A sluggish local economy could, therefore, result in losses that materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Regulation\nChanges in laws and regulations and the cost of regulatory compliance with new laws and regulations may adversely affect our operations and/or increase our costs of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision, and examination by our primary federal regulators, the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, and by the FDIC, the regulating authority that insures customer deposits. Also, as a member of the FHLB, the Bank must comply with applicable regulations of the Federal Housing Finance Agency and the FHLB. Regulation by these agencies is intended primarily for the protection of our depositors and the deposit insurance fund and not for the benefit of our shareholders. The Bank's activities are also regulated under consumer protection laws applicable to our lending, deposit, and other activities. A large claim against the Bank under these laws or an enforcement action by our regulators could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the ability to impose restrictions on our operations, comments on the classification of our assets, and determine the level of our allowance for credit losses. These regulations, along with the currently existing tax, accounting, securities, deposit insurance and monetary laws, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations, control the ways financial institutions conduct business, implement strategic initiatives, and prepare financial reporting and disclosures. Changes in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, new regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material impact on our operations. Further, compliance with such regulation may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities.\nWe cannot predict the effect of legislative and regulatory initiatives, which could increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges to statutes, regulations, regulatory or accounting policies could affect the Corporation in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject the Corporation to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products the Corporation may offer, limit the fees we may charge, increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, change regulatory capital requirements or the required size of our allowance for credit losses and change deposit insurance assessments, any of which would negatively impact our financial condition and result of operations. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Wealth Management Industry\nRevenues and profitability from our wealth management business may be adversely affected by any reduction in assets under management, which could reduce fees earned.\nThe wealth management business derives the majority of its revenue from noninterest income, which consists of trust, investment advisory and brokerage and other servicing fees. Substantial revenues are generated from investment management contracts with clients. Under these contracts, the investment advisory fees paid to us are typically based on the market value of assets under management. Assets under management may decline for various reasons including declines in the market value of the assets in the funds and accounts managed, which could be caused by price declines in the securities markets generally or by price declines in specific market segments. Assets under management may also decrease due to redemptions and other withdrawals by clients or termination of contracts. This could be in response to adverse market conditions or in pursuit of other investment opportunities. If our assets under management decline and there is a related decrease in fees, it will negatively affect our results of operations.\nWe may not be able to attract and retain wealth management clients.\nDue to strong competition, our wealth management business may not be able to attract and retain clients. Competition is strong because there are numerous well-established and successful investment management and wealth advisory firms including commercial banks and trust companies, investment advisory firms, mutual fund companies, stock brokerage firms, and other financial companies. Many of our competitors have greater resources than we have.\nOur ability to successfully attract and retain wealth management clients is dependent upon our ability to compete with competitors' investment products, level of investment performance, client services and marketing and distribution capabilities. If we are not successful, our results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted.\nThe wealth management business is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by regulators, and any enforcement action or adverse changes in the laws or regulations governing our business could decrease our revenues and profitability.\nThe wealth management business is subject to regulation by a number of regulatory agencies that are charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with protecting the interests of customers participating in those markets. In the event of non-compliance with regulation, governmental regulators, including the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\"FINRA\"), may institute administrative or judicial proceedings that may result in censure, fines, civil penalties, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or the deregistration or suspension of the non-compliant introducing broker-dealer or investment adviser or other adverse consequences. The imposition of any such penalties or orders could have a material adverse effect on the wealth management segment's operating results and financial condition. We may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations. Regulatory changes have imposed and may continue to impose additional costs, which could adversely impact our profitability.\nRisks Related to the Insurance Industry\nRevenues and profitability from our insurance business may be adversely affected by market conditions, which could reduce insurance commissions and fees earned.\nThe revenues of our fee-based insurance business are derived primarily from commissions from the sale of insurance policies, which commissions are generally calculated as a percentage of the policy premium. These insurance policy commissions can fluctuate as insurance carriers change the premiums on the insurance products we sell. Due to the cyclical nature of the insurance market and the impact of other market and macroeconomic conditions on insurance premiums, commission levels may vary. The reduction of these commission rates, along with general volatility and/or declines in premiums, may adversely impact our profitability.\nRisks Related to Competition\nThe Corporation operates in a highly competitive industry and market area, which could adversely impact its business and results of operations.\nWe face substantial competition in all phases of our businesses from a variety of different competitors. Our competitors, including commercial banks, community banks, savings institutions, credit unions, consumer finance companies, insurance companies, securities dealers, brokers, mortgage bankers, investment advisors, money market mutual funds and other financial technology and financial institutions, compete with us for loans and deposits and insurance and wealth management services offered by us. Increased competition in our markets may result in reduced loans and deposits or may negatively impact the pricing of such products.\nMany of these competing institutions have much greater financial and marketing resources than we have. Due to their size, many competitors can achieve larger economies of scale and may offer a broader range of products and services than we can. If we are unable to compete effectively in the offerings of our products and services, our business may be negatively affected.\nSome of the financial services organizations with which we compete are not subject to the same degree of regulation or tax structure as is imposed on bank holding companies and federally insured financial institutions. As a result, these non-bank competitors have certain advantages over us in providing lower-cost products, accessing funding and in providing various services. The banking business in our primary market areas is very competitive, and the level of competition and their pricing structure facing us may increase further, which may limit our asset growth and financial results.\nRisks Related to Strategic Activities\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future and such capital may not be available when needed or at all.\nFederal regulatory agencies have the authority to change the Corporation's and Bank's capital requirements and new accounting rules could have a negative impact on our regulatory capital ratios. Accordingly, we may need to raise additional capital in the future to provide us with sufficient capital resources to meet our commitments and business needs. We may also at\nsome point need to raise additional capital to support our continued growth. If we raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or other securities, it would dilute the ownership interests of existing shareholders and may dilute the per share book value of our common stock. New investors may also have rights, preferences and privileges senior to our current shareholders, which may adversely impact our current shareholders. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, or at attractive prices, will depend on, among other things, conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of our control, and our financial performance. An inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPotential acquisitions may disrupt the Corporation's business and dilute shareholder value.\nWe regularly evaluate opportunities to acquire and invest in banks and in other complementary businesses. As a result, we may engage in negotiations or discussions that, if they were to result in a transaction, could have a material effect on our operating results and financial condition, including short and long-term liquidity and capital structure. Our acquisition activities could be material to us. For example, we could issue additional shares of common stock in a merger transaction, which could dilute current shareholders' ownership interest. An acquisition could require us to use a substantial amount of cash, other liquid assets, and/or incur debt.\nOur acquisition activities could involve a number of additional risks, including the risks of:\n\u2022Incurring time and expense associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and negotiating potential transactions;\n\u2022Using inaccurate estimates and judgments to evaluate credit, operations, management, and market risks with respect to the target institution or its assets;\n\u2022The time and expense required to integrate the operations and personnel of the combined businesses;\n\u2022Creating an adverse short-term effect on our results of operations;\n\u2022Failing to realize related revenue synergies and/or cost savings within expected time frames; and\n\u2022Losing key employees and customers or a reduction in our stock price as a result of an acquisition that is poorly received.\nWe may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with potential acquisitions. Our inability to overcome these risks could have an adverse effect on our ability to achieve our business strategy and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe Corporation's stock price can be volatile.\nThe Corporation's stock price can fluctuate in response to a variety of factors, some of which are not under our control. The factors that could cause the Corporation's stock price to decrease include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022Our past and future dividend practice;\n\u2022Our financial condition, performance, creditworthiness and prospects;\n\u2022Variations in our operating results or the quality of our assets;\n\u2022Operating results that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022Changes in expectations as to our future financial performance;\n\u2022Changes in financial markets related to market valuations of financial industry companies;\n\u2022The operating and securities price performance of other companies that investors believe are comparable to us;\n\u2022Future sales of our equity or equity-related securities;\n\u2022The credit, mortgage and housing markets, the markets for securities relating to mortgages or housing, and developments with respect to financial institutions generally; and\n\u2022Changes in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, stock, commodity or real estate valuations or volatility and other geopolitical, regulatory or judicial events.\nThe limited liquidity of our common stock may limit your ability to trade our shares and may impact the value of our common stock.\nWhile the Corporation's common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, the trading volume has historically been less than that of larger financial services companies. Stock price volatility may make it more difficult for investors to sell their common stock when they want and at prices they find attractive.\nA public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control. Given the relatively low trading volume of our common stock, significant sales of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that those sales may occur, could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline or to be lower than it otherwise might be in the absence of those sales or perceptions.\nAnti-takeover provisions could negatively impact our shareholders.\nCertain provisions in the Corporation's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, as well as federal banking laws, regulatory approval requirements, and Pennsylvania law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the Corporation, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to the Corporation's shareholders.\nThere may be future sales or other dilution of the Corporation's equity, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe Corporation is generally not restricted from issuing additional common stock, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock. The issuance of any additional shares of common stock or preferred stock or securities convertible into, exchangeable for or that represent the right to receive common stock or the exercise of such securities could be substantially dilutive to shareholders of our common stock. Holders of our shares of common stock have no preemptive rights that entitle holders to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of offerings or because of sales of shares of our common stock made after offerings or the perception that such sales could occur. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, our shareholders bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting their stock holdings in us.\nThe Corporation relies on dividends from our subsidiaries for most of our revenue.\nThe Corporation is a bank holding company and our operations are conducted by our subsidiaries from which we receive dividends. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends is subject to legal and regulatory limitations, profitability, financial condition, capital expenditures and other cash flow requirements. The ability of the Bank to pay cash dividends to the Corporation is limited by its obligation to maintain sufficient capital and by other restrictions on its cash dividends that are applicable to state member banks in the Federal Reserve System. If the Bank is not permitted to pay cash dividends to the Corporation, it is unlikely that we would be able to pay cash dividends on our common stock.", "PERMNO": 89828, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "UVSP"}
