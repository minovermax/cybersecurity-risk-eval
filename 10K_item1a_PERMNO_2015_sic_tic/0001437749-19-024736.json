{"cik": "1001258", "company": "ASTA FUNDING INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-12-20", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nNote Regarding Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risk factors below as well as risks identified throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC in evaluating us. In addition to the following identified risks, there may also be risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial that may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, or if risks that we do not yet know or that we currently think are minor occur, our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition could be adversely affected, the trading price of our common stock could decline and stockholders might lose all or part of their investment. The risk factors presented below are those which we currently consider material. However, they are not the only risks facing our company. Additional risks not presently known to us, or which we currently consider immaterial, may also adversely affect us. There may be risks that a particular investor views differently from us, and our analysis might be wrong. If any of the risks that we face actually occur, our business, financial condition, cash flows and operating results could be materially adversely affected and could differ materially from any possible results suggested by any forward-looking statements that we have made or might make. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. Except as required by law, we expressly disclaim any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.\nWe have concluded that there are material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which if not remediated, could materially adversely affected our ability to timely and accurately report our results of operations and financial condition. These material weaknesses have not been fully remediated as of the filing date of this Form 10-K and we cannot assure you that other material weaknesses will not be identified in the future. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected.\nAs described in \u201cPart II, Item 9A - Controls and Procedures,\u201d of this Form 10-K we have concluded that there are material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and that our disclosure controls and procedures are ineffective as of September 30, 2019. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. It is necessary for us to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting to prevent fraud and errors and to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures so that we can provide timely and reliable financial and other information.\nAs further described in Part II, Item 9A in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are taking specific steps to remediate the material weaknesses that we identified by implementing and enhancing our control procedures. These material weaknesses will not be remediated until all necessary internal controls have been implemented, tested and determined to be operating effectively. In addition, we may need to take additional measures to address the material weaknesses or modify the planned remediation steps, and we cannot be certain that the measures we have taken, and expect to take, to improve our internal controls will be sufficient to address the issues identified, to ensure that our internal controls are effective or to ensure that the identified material weaknesses will not result in a material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements.\nMoreover, other material weaknesses or deficiencies may develop or be identified in the future. If we are unable to correct material weaknesses or deficiencies in internal controls in a timely manner, our ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information accurately and within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, will be adversely affected. This failure could negatively affect the market price and trading liquidity of our common stock, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, subject us to civil and criminal investigations and penalties, and otherwise materially and adversely impact our business and financial condition.\nGovernment regulations may limit our ability to recover and enforce the collection of our receivables.\nFederal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and ordinances may limit our ability to recover and enforce our rights with respect to the receivables acquired by us. These laws include, but are not limited to, the following federal statutes and regulations promulgated thereunder and comparable statutes in states and foreign jurisdictions, such as Colombia and Peru, where consumers reside and/or where creditors are located:\n\u2022\nThe Fair Debt Collection Practices Act;\n\u2022\nThe Federal Trade Commission Act;\n\u2022\nThe Truth-In-Lending Act;\n\u2022\nThe Fair Credit Billing Act;\n\u2022\nThe Equal Credit Opportunity Act;\n\u2022\nThe Fair Credit Reporting Act;\n\u2022\nThe Financial Privacy Rule;\n\u2022\nThe Safeguards Rule;\n\u2022\nTelephone Consumer Protection Act;\n\u2022\nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (\u201cHIPAA\u201d)/Health Information Technology for Economical and Clinical Health Act (\u201cHITECH\u201d);\n\u2022\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code; and\n\u2022\nCredit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009.\nWe may be precluded from collecting receivables we purchase where the creditor or other previous owner or third-party collection agency or attorney failed to comply with applicable law in originating or servicing such acquired receivables. Laws relating to the collection of consumer debt also directly apply to our business. Our failure to comply with any laws applicable to us, including state licensing laws, could limit our ability to recover on receivables and could subject us to fines and penalties, which could reduce our earnings and result in a default under our loan arrangements. In addition, our third-party collection agencies and attorneys may be subject to these and other laws and their failure to comply with such laws could also materially adversely affect our finance income and earnings.\nAdditional laws or amendments to existing laws may be enacted that could impose additional restrictions on the servicing and collection of receivables. Such new laws or amendments may adversely affect the ability to collect on our receivables, which could also adversely affect our finance income and earnings.\nBecause our receivables are generally originated and serviced pursuant to a variety of federal, state and/or local laws by a variety of entities and may involve consumers in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and South America, there can be no assurance that all originating and servicing entities have, at all times, been in substantial compliance with applicable law. Additionally, there can be no assurance that we or our third-party collection agencies and attorneys have been or will continue to be at all times in substantial compliance with applicable law. Failure to comply with applicable law could materially adversely affect our ability to collect our receivables and could subject us to increased costs, fines and penalties.\nWe are subject to changing rules and regulations of federal and state government as well as the stock exchange on which our common stock is listed. These entities, including PCAOB, the SEC and the NASDAQ Global Market, have issued a significant number of new and increasingly complex requirements and regulations over the course of the last several years and continue to develop additional regulations and requirements in response to laws enacted by Congress.\nChanges in laws and governmental regulations could increase our costs and liabilities or impact our operations.\nTitle X of the Dodd-Frank Act (also referred to as the Consumer Financial Protection Act) created a new independent regulator, CFPB. The CFPB has rulemaking, supervisory, and enforcement and other authorities relating to consumer financial products and services, including debt collection, provided by covered persons. We are subject to the CFPB's supervisory and enforcement authority.\nThe relationship between consumers, lenders and credit card issuers is extensively regulated by consumer protection and related laws and regulations. Changes in laws and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied may alter our business environment. This could affect our results of operations or increase our liabilities. These negative impacts could result from changes in collection laws, laws related to credit reporting, statutes of limitation, laws related to consumer bankruptcy or insolvency, privacy protection, accounting standards, taxation requirements, employment laws and communications laws, among others.\nThe CFPB also accepts debt collection consumer complaints and has provided form letters for consumers to use in their correspondences with debt collectors. The CFPB makes publicly available its data on consumer complaints, and consumer complaints against us could result in reputational damage to us. The Dodd-Frank Act also mandates the submission of multiple studies and reports to Congress by the CFPB, and CFPB staff is regularly making speeches on topics related to credit and debt. All of these activities could trigger additional legislative or regulatory action.\nThe CFPB has rulemaking authority with respect to significant federal statutes that impact the debt collection industry, including the Federal Debt Collection Practices Act (\"FDCPA\"), the Fair Credit Reporting Act (\"FCRA\"), and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC Act\"), which prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices. As a result, the CFPB has the authority to adopt regulations that interpret the FDCPA, and the FTC Act, potentially describing specified acts and practices as being \"unfair,\" \"deceptive\" or \"abusive,\" impacting the manner in which we conduct our debt collection business.\nThe CFPB has the authority to conduct hearings and adjudication proceedings, impose monetary penalties for violations of applicable federal consumer financial laws (including Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act, FDCPA, and FCRA, among other consumer protection statutes) which may require remediation of practices and include enforcement actions. The CFPB also has the authority to obtain cease and desist orders (which can include orders for restitution or rescission of contracts, as well as other kinds of affirmative relief), costs, and monetary penalties. In addition, where a company has violated Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act or CFPB regulations implemented thereunder, the Dodd-Frank Act empowers state Attorneys General and other state regulators to bring civil actions to remedy violations under state law. The CFPB has been active in its supervision, examination and enforcement of financial services companies, most notably bringing enforcement actions imposing fines and mandating large refunds to customers of several financial institutions for practices relating to the extension and collection of consumer credit. If the CFPB, the FTC, acting under the FTC Act or other applicable statute such as the FDCPA, or one or more state Attorneys General or other state regulators make findings that we have violated any of the applicable laws or regulations, they could exercise their enforcement powers in ways that could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition.\nWe may become subject to additional costs or liabilities in the future resulting from our own or our vendors' supervision or examination by the CFPB, or by changes in, or additions to, laws and regulations that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Further, we cannot definitively predict the scope and substance of any such laws or regulations ultimately adopted by the CFPB related to our activities and the exact efforts required by us to comply therewith, nor can we have any way to know with certainty the ultimate impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition that such regulations may have.\nInvestigations or enforcement actions by governmental authorities may result in changes to our business practices; negatively impact our receivables portfolio purchasing volume; make collection of receivables more difficult or expose us to the risk of fines, penalties, restitution payments and litigation .\nOur business practices are subject to review from time to time by various governmental authorities and regulators, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\"CFPB\"), which may commence investigations or enforcement actions or reviews targeted at businesses in the financial services industry. These reviews may involve governmental authority consideration of individual consumer complaints, or could involve a broader review of our debt collection policies and practices. Such investigations could lead to assertions by governmental authorities that we are not complying with applicable laws or regulations. In such circumstances, authorities may request or seek to impose a range of remedies that could involve potential compensatory or punitive damage claims, fines, restitution payments, sanctions or injunctive relief, that if agreed to or granted, could require us to make payments or incur other expenditures that could have an adverse effect on our financial position. Government authorities could also request or seek to require us to cease certain of our practices or institute new practices.\nWe may also elect to change practices that we believe are compliant with applicable law and regulations in order to respond to the concerns of governmental authorities. In addition, we may become required to make changes to our internal policies and procedures in order to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act or other applicable laws. Such changes in practices or procedures could negatively impact our results of operations. Negative publicity relating to investigations or proceedings brought by governmental authorities could have an adverse impact on our reputation, could harm our ability to conduct business with industry participants, and could result in financial institutions reducing or eliminating sales of receivables portfolios to us which would harm our business and negatively impact our financial results. Moreover, changing or modifying our internal policies or procedures, responding to governmental inquiries and investigations and defending lawsuits or other proceedings could require significant efforts on the part of management and result in increased costs to our business. In addition, such efforts could divert management's full attention from our business operations. All of these factors could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to purchase consumer receivable portfolios domestically and internationally at favorable prices or on sufficiently favorable terms if at all.\nOur success in the consumer receivables business segment depends upon the continued availability of consumer receivable portfolios that meet our purchasing criteria and our ability to identify and finance the purchases of such portfolios. The availability of consumer receivable portfolios at favorable prices and on terms acceptable to us, if at all, depends on a number of factors outside of our control, including:\n\u2022\nthe growth in consumer debt;\n\u2022\nthe volume of consumer receivable portfolios available for sale;\n\u2022\navailability of financing to fund purchases;\n\u2022\ncompetitive factors affecting potential purchasers and sellers of consumer receivable portfolios;\n\u2022\npossible future changes in the bankruptcy laws, state laws and homestead acts which could make it more difficult for us to collect, and\n\u2022\nThe foreign exchange rate changes of the countries in which we do business.\nThere is no assurance that we will realize the full value of the deferred tax asset.\nAs of September 30, 2019, we had a net deferred tax asset of $9.6 million. Our ability to use our deferred tax asset is dependent on our ability to generate future earnings within the operating loss carry-forward periods, which are generally 20 years. Some or all of our deferred tax asset could expire unused if we are unable to generate taxable income in the future sufficient to utilize the deferred tax asset, or we enter into transactions that limit our right to use it. If a material portion of our deferred tax asset expires unused, it could have a material adverse effect on our future business, results of operations, financial condition and the value of our common stock. Our ability to realize the deferred tax asset is periodically reviewed and any necessary valuation allowance is adjusted accordingly.\nAdditionally, on December 22, 2017 the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cAct\u201d) was signed into law. Among other provisions, the Act reduces the Federal statutory corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. This rate reduction had a significant impact on our provisions for income taxes for periods beginning after September 30, 2017, including a one-time impact resulting from the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the new lower rate. Our assessment of the Act resulted in a one-time charge to income taxes of approximately $3.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2018.\nWe may not be able to collect sufficient amounts on our consumer receivable portfolios to recover the costs associated with the purchase of those portfolios and to fund our operations.\nWe acquire and collect on consumer receivable portfolios that contain charged-off receivables. In order to operate profitably over the long term, we must continually purchase and collect on a sufficient volume of receivables to generate revenue that exceeds our purchase costs. For accounts that are charged-off or semi-performing, the originators or interim owners of the receivables generally have:\n\u2022\nmade numerous attempts to collect on these obligations, often using both their in-house collection staff and third-party collection agencies; and/or\n\u2022\nsubsequently deemed these obligations to be uncollectible.\nThese receivable portfolios are purchased at significant discounts to the amount the consumers owe. These receivables are difficult to collect and actual recoveries may be less than the amount expected. In addition, our collections may worsen in a weak economic cycle. We may not recover amounts in excess of our acquisition and servicing costs.\nOur ability to recover the purchase costs on our portfolios and produce sufficient returns can be negatively impacted by the quality of the purchased receivables. In the normal course of our portfolio acquisitions, some receivables may be included in the portfolios that fail to conform to certain terms of the purchase agreements and we may seek to return these receivables to the seller for payment or replacement receivables. However, we cannot guarantee that any of such sellers will be able to meet their payment obligations to us. Accounts that we are unable to return to sellers may yield no return. If cash flows from operations are less than anticipated as a result of our inability to collect sufficient amounts on our receivables, our ability to satisfy our debt obligations, purchase new portfolios, and achieve future growth and profitability may be materially adversely affected.\nWe may be subject to competition for the purchase of international consumer receivable portfolios which may result in an increase in prices of such portfolios.\nWe compete with other purchasers of consumer receivable portfolios, with third-party collection agencies and with financial services companies that manage their own consumer receivable portfolios. We compete on the basis of price, reputation, industry experience and performance. Some of our competitors have greater capital, personnel and other resources than we have. The possible entry of new competitors, including competitors that historically have focused on the acquisition of different asset types, and the expected increase in competition from current market participants may reduce our access to consumer receivable portfolios. Aggressive pricing by our competitors has raised the price of consumer receivable portfolios above levels that we are willing to pay, which could reduce the number of consumer receivable portfolios suitable for us to purchase or if purchased by us, reduce the profits, if any, generated by such portfolios. If we are unable to purchase receivable portfolios at favorable prices or at all, our finance income and earnings could be materially reduced.\nWe depend upon third parties to service a significant portion of our domestic and international consumer receivable portfolios. The loss of certain servicers could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operation.\nAt September 30, 2019, approximately 28% of our portfolio face value, which represents approximately 86% of our portfolio face value at all third-party collection agencies and attorneys, is serviced by four organizations domestically and one organization internationally. We are dependent upon the efforts of these collection agencies and attorneys to service and collect our consumer receivables. Any failure by our third-party collection agencies and attorneys to adequately perform collection services for us or remit such collections to us could materially reduce our finance income and our profitability. In addition, our finance income and profitability could be materially adversely affected if we are not able to secure replacement third party collection agencies and attorneys and redirect payments from the customers to our new third party collection agencies and attorneys promptly in the event our agreements with our third-party collection agencies and attorneys are terminated, our third-party collection agencies and attorneys fail to adequately perform their obligations or if our relationships with such third-party collection agencies and attorneys adversely change.\nWe may rely on third parties to locate, identify and evaluate consumer receivable portfolios available for purchase.\nWe may rely on third parties, including brokers and third-party collection agencies and attorneys, to identify consumer receivable portfolios and, in some instances, to assist us in our evaluation and purchase of these portfolios. As a result, if such third parties fail to identify receivable portfolios or if our relationships with such third parties are not maintained, our ability to identify and purchase additional receivable portfolios could be materially adversely affected. In addition, if we, or such parties, fail to correctly or adequately evaluate the value or collectability of these consumer receivable portfolios, we may pay too much for such portfolios and suffer an impairment, which would negatively impact our earnings.\nWe rely on our third-party collectors to comply with all rules and regulations and maintain proper internal controls over their accounting and operations.\nBecause the receivables were originated and serviced pursuant to a variety of federal and/or state laws by a variety of entities and involved consumers in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Columbia and Peru, there can be no assurance that all original servicing entities have, at all times, been in substantial compliance with applicable laws. Additionally, there can be no assurance that we or our third-party collection agencies and attorneys have been or will continue to be at all times in substantial compliance with applicable laws. The failure to comply with applicable laws and not maintain proper controls in accounting and operations could materially adversely affect our ability to collect our receivables and could subject us to increased costs, fines and penalties.\nOur collections may decrease if bankruptcy filings increase.\nDuring times of economic uncertainty, the amount of defaulted consumer receivables generally increases, which contributes to an increase in the amount of personal bankruptcy filings. Under certain bankruptcy filings, a debtor\u2019s assets are sold to repay credit originators, but since the defaulted consumer receivables we purchase are generally unsecured, we may not be able to collect on those receivables. Our collections may decline with an increase in bankruptcy filings. If our actual collection experience with respect to a defaulted consumer receivable portfolio is significantly lower than we projected when we purchased the portfolio, our earnings could be negatively affected.\nWe are subject to various risks in connection with our litigation funding business.\nRisks of the litigation funding business include the potential regulation or limitation of interest rates and other fees advanced by our litigation funding subsidiaries under federal and/or state regulation, a change in statutory or case law which limits or restricts the ability of our litigation funding subsidiaries to charge or collect fees and interest at anticipated levels, claimants being unsuccessful in whole or in part in the personal injury claims or divorce settlement upon which our funds are provided, the continued services of the senior management of our litigation funding subsidiaries to source and analyze cases in accordance with the subsidiaries\u2019 respective underwriting guidelines. In addition, negative press regarding the litigation funding business could trigger challenges to funding contracts, have an adverse impact on our reputation, or harm our ability to conduct business with industry participants.\nThe loss of any of our executive officers may adversely affect our operations and our ability to successfully acquire receivable portfolios.\nOur executive officers are responsible for making substantially all management decisions, including determining which portfolios to purchase, the purchase price and other material terms of such portfolio acquisitions. These decisions are instrumental to the success of our business. Significant losses of the services of our executive officers or the inability to replace our officers with individuals who have experience in the industry or with the Company could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our ability to successfully acquire receivable portfolios.\nThe Stern family effectively controls the Company, substantially reducing the influence of our other stockholders.\nMembers of the Stern family own directly or indirectly, approximately 62% of our outstanding shares of common stock as of September 30, 2019. Through January 6, 2019, the Stern family, in conjunction with a voting agreement signed with an activist shareholder in January 2017; was limited to voting up to 49% of the outstanding shares. As a result, the Stern family is able to significantly influence the actions that require stockholder approval, including:\n\u2022\nthe election of our directors; and\n\u2022\nthe approval of mergers, sales of assets or other corporate transactions or matters submitted for stockholder approval.\nAs a result, our other stockholders may have reduced influence over matters submitted for stockholder approval. In addition, the Stern family\u2019s influence could discourage any unsolicited acquisition of the Company and, consequently, materially adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nOn October 30, 2019, Gary M. Stern submitted a non-binding proposal (the \u201cProposal\u201d) to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock. The Board of Directors is evaluating whether the acceptance of the Proposal is in the best interest of the Company and our shareholders. We are uncertain as to what impact the potential transaction by Mr. Stern or any other particular strategic alternative will have on our operating results, our stock price and our business if accomplished or whether any transaction will even occur. There can be no assurance that the review of the Proposal will result in any agreements or transactions. Other uncertainties and risks relating to our review of the Proposal include:\n\u2022\nthe review of the Proposal may disrupt our operations, affect morale and distract management which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results;\n\u2022\nperceived uncertainties as to our future could have a negative impact on our relationships with customers and may result in the loss of business opportunities;\n\u2022\nperceived uncertainties as to our future may result in increased difficulties in recruiting and retaining employees, particularly highly qualified employees; and\n\u2022\nthe process of reviewing the Proposal may be more time consuming and expensive than we currently anticipate.\nNegative press regarding the debt collection industry may have a negative impact on a customer\u2019s willingness to pay the debt we acquire.\nConsumers are exposed to information from a number of sources that may cause them to be more reluctant to pay their debts or to pursue legal actions against us. Online, print and other media publish stories about the debt collection industry which cite specific examples of abusive collection practices. These stories can lead to the rapid dissemination of the story, adding to the level of exposure to negative publicity about our industry. Various internet sites are maintained where consumers can list their concerns about the activities of debt collectors and seek guidance from other website posters on how to handle the situation. Advertisements by debt relief attorneys and credit counseling centers are becoming more common, adding to the negative attention given to our industry. As a result of this negative publicity, customers may be more reluctant to pay their debts or could pursue legal action against us regardless of whether those actions are warranted. These actions could impact our ability to collect on the receivables we acquire and affect our revenues and profitability.\nClass action suits and other litigation could divert our management\u2019s attention from operating our business and increase our expenses.\nOriginators, debt purchasers and third-party collection agencies and attorneys in the consumer credit industry are frequently subject to putative class action lawsuits and other litigation. Claims include failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations and improper or deceptive origination and servicing practices. Being a defendant in such class action lawsuits or other litigation could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nEconomic slowdowns increase our credit losses.\nDuring periods of economic slowdown or recession, we experience an increase in rates of delinquencies and frequency and severity of credit losses. Our actual rates of delinquencies and frequency and severity of credit losses may be comparatively higher during periods of economic slowdown or recession than those experienced by more traditional providers of consumer credit because of our focus on the financially underserved consumer market, which may be disproportionately impacted.\nBecause a significant portion of our reported income is based on management\u2019s estimates of the future performance of our asset portfolios and fees receivable, differences between actual and expected performance of the receivables may cause fluctuations in net income.\nSignificant portions of our reported income (or losses) are based on management\u2019s estimates of cash flows we expect to receive on our asset portfolios and fees receivable, particularly for such assets that we report based on fair value. The expected cash flows are based on management\u2019s estimates of interest rates, default rates, payment rates, cardholder purchases, servicing costs, and discount rates. These estimates are based on a variety of factors, many of which are not within our control. Substantial differences between actual and expected performance of the receivables will occur and cause fluctuations in our net income. For instance, higher than expected rates of delinquencies and losses could cause our net income to be lower than expected. Similarly, levels of loss and delinquency can result in our being required to repay our lenders earlier than expected, thereby reducing funds available to us for future growth.\nWe may determine to incur near-term losses based on longer-term strategic considerations.\nWe may consider long-term strategic considerations more important than near-term economic gains when assessing business arrangements and opportunities. We may nevertheless determine to participate in, or structure, future financing transactions based on longer-term strategic considerations.\nWe may experience losses on portfolios consisting of new types of receivables or receivables in new geographies due to our lack of collection experience with these receivables, which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe continually look for opportunities to expand the classes of assets that make up the portfolios we acquire. Therefore, we may acquire portfolios consisting of assets with which we have little or no collection experience or portfolios of receivables in new geographies where we do not historically maintain an operational footprint. Our lack of experience with these assets may hinder our ability to generate expected levels of profits from these portfolios. Further, our existing methods of collections may prove ineffective for these new receivables, and we may not be able to collect on these portfolios. Our inexperience with these receivables may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may not be able to manage our growth effectively, including the expansion of our foreign operations.\nContinued growth will place additional demands on our resources, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to manage our growth effectively. For example, continued growth could place strains on our management, operations, and financial resources that our infrastructure, facilities, and personnel may not be able to adequately support. In addition, the recent expansion of our foreign operations subjects us to a number of additional risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u25a0\ncompliance with and changes in international laws, including regulatory and compliance requirements that could affect our business;\n\u25a0\nincreased exposure to U.S. laws that apply abroad, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u25a0\nsocial, political and economic instability or recessions;\n\u25a0\nfluctuations in foreign economies and currency exchange rates;\n\u25a0\ndifficulty in hiring, staffing and managing qualified and proficient local employees and advisors to run international operations;\n\u25a0\nthe difficulty of managing and operating an international enterprise, including difficulties in maintaining effective communications with employees due to distance, language, and cultural barriers;\n\u25a0\ndifficulties implementing and maintaining effective internal controls and risk management and compliance initiatives;\n\u25a0\npotential disagreements with our joint venture business partners;\n\u25a0\ndiffering labor regulations and business practices; and\n\u25a0\nforeign tax consequences.\nTo support our growth and improve our international operations, we continue to make investments in infrastructure, facilities, and personnel in our operations; however, these additional investments may not be successful or our investments may not produce profitable results. If we cannot manage our growth effectively, our business, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected.\nWe may seek to make acquisitions that prove unsuccessful or strain or divert our resources.\nWe may seek to grow through acquisitions of related businesses in the financial services sector. Such acquisitions present risks that could materially adversely affect our business and financial performance, including:\n\u2022\nthe diversion of our management\u2019s attention from our everyday business activities;\n\u2022\nthe assimilation of the operations and personnel of the acquired business;\n\u2022\nthe contingent and latent risks associated with the past operations of, and other unanticipated problems arising in, the acquired business; and\n\u2022\nthe need to expand management, administration and operational systems.\nIf we make such acquisitions, we cannot predict whether:\n\u2022\nwe will be able to successfully integrate the operations of any new businesses into our business;\n\u2022\nwe will realize any anticipated benefits of completed acquisitions; or\n\u2022\nthere will be substantial unanticipated costs associated with acquisitions.\nIn addition, future acquisitions by us may result in:\n\u2022\npotentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities;\n\u2022\nthe incurrence of debt; and\n\u2022\nthe recognition of significant charges for depreciation and impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets.\nIf our technology infrastructure is not operational, our operations could be disrupted and our ability to successfully operate the business could be compromised.\nOur success depends, in part, on sophisticated telecommunications and computer systems. The temporary loss of our computer or telecommunications systems, through casualty, operating malfunction or service provider failure, could disrupt our operations. In addition, we must record and process significant amounts of data quickly and accurately to properly bid on prospective acquisitions of receivable portfolios and to access, maintain and expand the databases we use for our collection and monitoring activities. Any failure of our information systems and their backup systems could interrupt our operations. We may not have adequate backup arrangements for all of our operations and we may incur significant losses if an outage occurs. In addition, we rely on third-party collection agencies and attorneys who also may be adversely affected in the event of an outage in which the third-party collection agencies and attorneys do not have adequate backup arrangements. Any interruption in our operations or our third-party collection agencies\u2019 and attorneys\u2019 operations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We have implemented a disaster recovery program to mitigate this risk.\nIf we are unable to secure our customers\u2019 confidential information or other private data relating to our employees or our Company, we could be subject to negative publicity, costly government enforcement actions or private litigation, which could damage our business reputation and adversely affect our financial results.\nAs with other companies, we are periodically subject to cyberattacks. Cyberattacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently, are constantly evolving in nature, are becoming more sophisticated and are being made by groups and individuals (including criminal hackers, hacktivists, state-sponsored institutions, terrorist organizations and individuals or groups participating in organized crime) with a wide range of expertise and motives (including monetization of corporate, payment or other internal or personal data, theft of trade secrets and intellectual property for competitive advantage and leverage for political, social, economic and environmental reasons). Such cyberattacks and cyber incidents can take many forms including cyber extortion, denial of service, social engineering, such as impersonation attempts to fraudulently induce employees or others to disclose information or unwittingly provide access to systems or data, introduction of viruses or malware, such as ransomware through phishing emails, website defacement or theft of passwords and other credentials. Although we may incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyberattacks or other cyber incidents, no cyberattack or other cyber incident has, to our knowledge, had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations to date.\nThe protection of our customer, employee and company data is critical to us. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements that affect our business. In addition, customers have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information from cyberattack or other security breaches. We have procedures and technology in place designed to safeguard our customers\u2019 personal information, our employees\u2019 private data and company records, intellectual property and other confidential information, and we continue to devote significant resources to network security, backup and disaster recovery, and other security measures, including training, to protect our systems and data. Nevertheless, these security measures cannot provide absolute security or guarantee that we will be successful in preventing or responding to every such breach or disruption, including through the intentional or negligent actions of our employees, business associates or third parties. As a result, unauthorized parties may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate customer data and company confidential information.\nThere can be no assurance that advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments will prevent the compromise of our customer transaction processing capabilities and personal data. Furthermore, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. If any such compromise of our security or the security of information residing with our business associates or third parties were to occur, we could be exposed to negative publicity, government enforcement actions, card issuer fines and/or penalties, private litigation or costly response measures. In addition, our reputation within the business community and with our customers may be affected. This could cause us to lose market share to our competitors and could have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nOur organizational documents and Delaware law may make it harder for us to be acquired without the consent and cooperation of our board of directors and management.\nSeveral provisions of our organizational documents and Delaware law may deter or prevent a takeover attempt, including a takeover attempt in which the potential purchaser offers to pay a per share price greater than the current market price of our common stock. Under the terms of our certificate of incorporation, our Board of Directors has the authority, without further action by the stockholders, to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof. The ability to issue shares of preferred stock could tend to discourage takeover or acquisition proposals not supported by our current Board of Directors. In addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which restricts business combinations with some stockholders once the stockholder acquires 15% or more of our common stock.\nFuture sales of our common stock by our affiliates or other stockholders may depress our stock price.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause a decrease in the market price of our common stock. We had 6,567,765 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of December 16, 2019. Of these shares, 4,068,411 are owned by affiliates of the company, which are defined as in Rule 405 under the Act as a \u201cperson that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with,\u201d an issuer. In addition, options to purchase 722,567 shares of our common stock were outstanding as of September 30, 2019, of which 722,567 were exercisable. We may also issue additional shares in connection with our business and may grant additional stock options or restricted shares to our employees, officers, directors and consultants under our present or future equity compensation plans or we may issue warrants to third parties outside of such plans. As of September 30, 2019, there were 1,328,243 shares available for such purpose with such shares available under the 2012 Stock Option and Performance Award Plan. If a significant portion of these shares were sold in the public market, the market value of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nWe have the ability to issue preferred shares, warrants, convertible debt and other securities without stockholder approval, which could dilute the relative ownership interest of current stockholders and adversely affect our share price.\nFuture sales of our equity-related securities in the public market, could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our ability to raise funds in new stock offerings. Our common shares may be subordinate to classes of preferred shares issued in the future in the payment of dividends and other distributions made with respect to common shares, including distributions upon liquidation or dissolution. Our certificate of incorporation permits our Board of Directors to issue preferred shares without first obtaining stockholder approval. If we issued preferred shares, these additional securities may have dividend or liquidation preferences senior to our common shares. If we issue convertible preferred shares, a subsequent conversion may dilute the current common stockholders\u2019 interest. We have similar abilities to issue convertible debt, warrants and other equity securities.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate and cause our stock price to decline.\nBecause of the nature of our business, our quarterly operating results may fluctuate, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Our results may fluctuate as a result of any of the following:\n\u2022\nthe timing and amount of collections on our consumer receivable portfolios;\n\u2022\nour inability to identify and acquire additional consumer receivable portfolios;\n\u2022\na decline in the estimated future value of our consumer receivable portfolio recoveries;\n\u2022\nincreases in operating expenses associated with the growth of our operations;\n\u2022\ngeneral and economic market conditions; and within various jurisdictions; and\n\u2022\nprices we are willing to pay for consumer receivable portfolios.\nOur financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus local currencies.\nOur primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non- U.S. dollar denominated revenues and operating expenses worldwide. The Company does not use derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist shareholders, and such activism could impact the trading value of our securities.\nResponding to activist shareholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of management and our employees. Such activities could interfere with our ability to execute our strategic plan. In addition, a proxy contest for the election of directors at our annual meeting would require us to incur significant legal fees and proxy solicitation expenses and require significant time and attention by management and our Board of Directors. The perceived uncertainties as to our future direction also could affect the market price and volatility of our securities.\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d and, as such, are allowed to provide less disclosure than larger public companies.\nWe are currently a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. As a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d we have certain decreased disclosure obligations in our SEC filings, which may make it harder for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects and may result in less investor confidence.", "PERMNO": 82552, "SIC": 6153, "TIC": "ASFI"}
