{"cik": "1108236", "company": "AMERICAN RIVER BANKSHARES", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe Company and its subsidiary, American River Bank, conduct business in an environment that includes certain risks described below which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition, future prospects and stock price. You are also referred to the matters described under the heading \u201cCautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d in Part I, Item 1 and Part II, Item 7 of this report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding factors that may affect the Company\u2019s business.\n\u2022 We are subject to extensive regulation, which could adversely affect our business.\nOur operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local governmental authorities and are subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing requirements and restrictions on part or all of our operations. We believe that we are in substantial compliance in all material respects with laws, rules and regulations applicable to the conduct of our business. Because our business is highly regulated, the laws, rules and regulations applicable to us are subject to regular modification and change. These laws, rules and regulations may be modified, or other new laws, rules or regulations, may be adopted in the future, which could make compliance much more difficult or expensive, or restrict our ability to originate, broker or sell loans, reduce service charge income on deposits, or further limit or restrict the amount of commissions, or interest or other charges earned on loans originated or sold by us or otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, or future prospects. The Dodd-Frank Act, signed into law on July 21, 2010, has had and is expected to continue to have a broad impact on the financial services sector, including significant regulatory and compliance changes. Many of the Dodd-Frank Act requirements will be implemented over an extended period of time and due to the uncertainty associated with the manner in which they will be implemented by the various regulatory agencies, the full extent of the impact such requirements will have on our operations is not clear. Changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may impact the profitability of our business activities, require changes to certain of our business practices, impose upon us more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage ratio requirements or otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or future prospects.\n\u2022 Difficult market conditions have adversely affected our business.\nDramatic declines occurred in the housing market during the economic downturn resulting in falling home prices and a significant number of foreclosures. These circumstances along with unemployment and under-employment continue to negatively impact the credit performance of our loan portfolio and resulted in significant write-downs of asset values. These asset write-downs have had a significant impact on the Company\u2019s financial results and ratios, including our net income, earnings per share, return on average equity and return on average assets. Our net income decreased from $7,751,000 in 2008 to $1,586,000 in 2009 and $476,000 in 2010, then increased to $2,504,000 in 2011, $3,207,000 in 2012 and decreased slightly from 2012 to $3,057,000 in 2013, then increased to $4,361,000 in 2014 and $5,268,000 in 2015. Our earnings per share decreased from $1.30 per share in 2008 to $0.26 per share in 2009 and $0.05 per share in 2010, then increased to $0.25 per share in 2011, $0.34 per share in 2012 and 2013, $0.54 per share in 2014 and $0.70 per share in 2015. Our return on average equity decreased from 12.39% in 2008 to 2.44% in 2009 and 0.53% in 2010, then increased to 2.74% in 2011, 3.42% in 2012 and decreased slightly from 2012 to 3.38% in 2013, then increased to 4.98% in 2014 and 6.03% in 2015. Our return on average assets decreased from 1.32% in 2008 to 0.28% in 2009 and 0.08% in 2010, then increased to 0.43% in 2011, 0.55% in 2012, 0.52% in 2013, 0.72 in 2014, and 0.85% in 2015. While there was some improvement in our financial results and ratios in recent years compared to 2008 through 2010, the increases are below our historical averages and there is no guarantee that these increases will continue into the future, which could adversely affect our stock price. A significant decline in our stock price could result in substantial losses for individual shareholders.\n\u2022 Worsening economic conditions could adversely affect our business.\nThe economic conditions in the United States in general and within California and in our operating markets have not fully recovered from the economic downturn of 2007 through 2010. Unemployment nationwide and in California increased significantly through this economic downturn and have returned to more normal historical levels, however, there is no certainty that these levels will continue in the future. As of December 31, 2015, the unemployment rate nationwide was 5.0% compared to 5.6% one year ago. At December 31, 2014, the unemployment rate nationwide was 5.6% compared to 6.7% at December 31, 2013, 7.9% at December 31, 2012, 8.5% at December 31, 2011, 9.4% at December 31, 2010, 9.9% at December 31, 2009, and 7.3% at December 31, 2008. As of December 31, 2015, the unemployment rate in California was 5.8%, compared to 7.3% at December 31, 2014, 8.3% at December 31, 2013, 9.8% at December 31, 2012, 11.1% at December 31, 2011, 12.5% at December 31, 2010, 12.3% at December 31, 2009 and 8.7% at December 31, 2008. The unemployment rate in the Company\u2019s primary markets of Sacramento, Sonoma, and Amador Counties was 5.6%, 4.2% and 6.3%, respectively, at December 31, 2015 compared to 6.2%, 4.7% and 7.2%, respectively, at December 31, 2014, 7.7%, 5.7% and 9.0%, respectively, at December 31, 2013, 9.8%, 7.7% and 11.0%, respectively, at December 31, 2012, 10.9%, 8.9% and 12.7%, respectively, at December 31, 2011, 12.7%, 10.0% and 13.4%, respectively, at December 31, 2010, 12.2%, 10.3% and 12.5%, respectively, at December 31, 2009, and 8.7%, 7.0% and 9.3%, respectively, at December 31, 2008. These unemployment statistics may not reflect the full extent of unemployment conditions nationwide, in California and in the Company\u2019s primary operating markets due to the exclusion of statistics regarding the number of persons who are no longer seeking employment, among other statistical data. Availability of credit and consumer spending, real estate values, and consumer confidence have all been adversely affected. The credit, capital and liquidity problems that have confronted the U.S. financial system during the economic downturn of 2007 through 2010 have not been fully resolved despite massive government expenditures and legislative efforts to stabilize the U.S. financial system. These conditions may not be fully resolved in the foreseeable future.\nThe Bank conducts banking operations principally in Northern California. As a result, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are subject to changes in the economic conditions in Northern California. Our business results are dependent in large part upon the business activity, population, income levels, deposits and real estate activity in Northern California, and continued adverse economic conditions could have a material adverse effect upon us. In addition, California\u2019s budgetary and fiscal difficulties during the downturn of 2007 through 2010 resulted in a reduction of the number of California government employees. The businesses operating in California and, in particular in the City of Sacramento, depend on the relationships with these government employees, and reduced spending activity by these government employees could have a material impact on the success or failure of these businesses, some of which are current customers or could become future customers of the Bank.\nThe market in which the Company operates experienced a slowdown in new loan volume as existing and potential new borrowers paid down debt and delayed expansion plans. This reduction in loan volume has had an adverse effect upon our net interest margin and profitability. Any deterioration in economic conditions locally, regionally or nationally could result in a further economic downturn in Northern California with the following consequences, any of which could further adversely affect our business:\n\u2022 loan delinquencies and defaults may increase;\n\u2022 problem assets and foreclosures may increase;\n\u2022 demand for loans and other products and services may decline;\n\u2022 low cost or noninterest bearing deposits may decrease;\n\u2022 collateral for loans may decline in value, in turn reducing clients\u2019 borrowing power, and reducing the value of assets and collateral as sources of repayment of existing loans;\n\u2022 foreclosed assets may not be able to be sold;\n\u2022 volatile securities market conditions could adversely affect valuations of investment portfolio assets; and\n\u2022 reputational risk may increase due to public sentiment regarding the banking industry.\n\u2022 Non-performing assets take significant time to resolve and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAt December 31, 2015, our non-performing loans and leases were 0.56% of total loans and leases compared to 0.63% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2014, 0.77% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2013, 2.12% at December 31, 2012, 4.46% at December 31, 2011, 6.52% at December 31, 2010, 5.46% at December 31, 2009 and 1.49% at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2015, our non-performing assets (which include foreclosed real estate and repossessed assets) to total assets were 0.96% compared to 1.16% at December 31, 2014, 1.60% at December 31, 2013, 2.97% at December 31, 2012, 3.73% at December 31, 2011, 4.36% at December 31, 2010, 3.95% at December 31, 2009, and 1.49% at December 31, 2008. The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of non-performing loans and leases was 302.8% as of December 31, 2015 compared to 320.7% as of December 31, 2014, 270.1% as of December 31, 2013, 105.6% as of December 31, 2012, 52.5% as of December 31, 2011, 33.6% at December 31, 2010, 37.7% at December 31, 2009 and 94.8% at December 31, 2008. While these non-performing loans and leases and non-performing assets have decreased in recent years, there is no guarantee that these decreases will continue into the future, which could adversely affect our stock price. A significant decline in our stock price could result in substantial losses for individual shareholders.\nNon-performing assets adversely affect our net income in various ways. We generally do not record interest income on non-performing loans or other real estate owned, thereby adversely affecting our income and increasing our loan administration costs. When we take collateral in foreclosures and similar proceedings, we are required to mark the related asset to the then fair market value of the collateral, which may ultimately result in a loss. An increase in the level of non-performing assets increases our risk profile and may impact the capital levels our regulators believe are appropriate in light of the ensuing risk profile, which could result in a request to reduce our level of non-performing assets and/or raise additional capital. When we reduce problem assets through loan sales, workouts, restructurings and otherwise, decreases in the value of the underlying collateral, or in these borrowers\u2019 performance or financial condition, whether or not due to economic and market conditions beyond our control, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the resolution of non-performing assets requires significant commitments of time from management and our directors, which can be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities. We may experience increases in non-performing assets and the disposition of such non-performing assets may adversely affect our profitability.\n\u2022 Tightening of credit markets and liquidity risk could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA tightening of the credit markets or any inability to obtain adequate funds for asset growth at an acceptable cost could adversely affect our asset growth and liquidity position and, therefore, our earnings capability. In addition to core deposit growth, maturity of investment securities and loan and lease payments, we also rely on alternative funding sources including unsecured borrowing lines with correspondent banks, secured borrowing lines with the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco and the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, and public time certificates of deposits. Our ability to access these sources could be impaired by deterioration in our financial condition as well as factors that are not specific to us, such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations for the financial services industry or serious dislocation in the general credit markets. In the event such a disruption should occur, our ability to access these sources could be adversely affected, both as to price and availability, which would limit or potentially raise the cost of the funds available to us.\n\u2022 We have a concentration risk in real estate related loans.\nAt December 31, 2015, $251.8 million, or 86.0% of our total loan and lease portfolio, consisted of real estate related loans. Of that amount, $199.6 million, or 79.3%, consisted of commercial real estate, $14.5 million, or 5.7% consisted of commercial and residential construction loans (including land acquisition and development loans) and $37.7 million, or 15.0%, consisted of residential mortgages and residential multi-family real estate. The majority of our real property collateral is located in our operating markets in Northern California. The deteriorating economic conditions in California and in our operating markets during the economic downturn of 2007 through 2010, contributed to an overall decline in commercial and residential real estate values. While property values have recovered somewhat, a substantial decline in commercial and residential real estate values in our primary market areas could occur as a result of worsening economic conditions or other events including natural disasters such as earthquakes, droughts, floods, fires, and similar adverse weather occurrences. Such a decline in values could have an adverse impact on us by limiting repayment of defaulted loans through sale of commercial and residential real estate collateral and by a likely increase in the number of defaulted loans to the extent that the financial condition of our borrowers is adversely affected by such a decline in values.\n\u2022 Our allowance for loan and lease losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses.\nLike all financial institutions, the Bank maintains an allowance for loan and lease losses to provide for loan defaults and non-performance, but its allowance for loan and lease losses may not be adequate to cover actual loan and lease losses. In addition, future provisions for loan and lease losses could materially and adversely affect the Bank\u2019s and therefore our Company\u2019s operating results. The adequacy of the Bank\u2019s allowance for loan and lease losses is based on prior experience, as well as an evaluation of the risks in the current portfolio. The amount of realizable future losses is susceptible to changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in the local and general California real estate market and operating environment, as well as interest rates, employment levels and other economic factors that may be beyond our control, and these losses may exceed current estimates.\nFederal regulatory agencies, as an integral part of the examination process, review the Bank\u2019s loans and leases and allowance for loan and lease losses, as well as management\u2019s policies and procedures for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses. We believe that our allowance for loan and lease losses policies are effective and that our allowance for loan and lease losses is adequate to cover current probable incurred losses. However, the Bank may have to further increase the allowance for loan and lease losses as a result of the effects of deterioration of economic conditions nationally and in the operating markets in which the Bank conducts business and/or as a result of changes in regulation or accounting methodologies.\n\u2022 Our focus on lending to small to mid-sized community-based businesses may increase our credit risk.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our largest outstanding commercial business loan and largest outstanding commercial real estate loan amounted to $5.8 million and $5.7 million, respectively. At such date, our commercial real estate loans amounted to $199.6 million, or 67.8% of our total loan and lease portfolio, and our commercial business loans amounted to $36.2 million, or 12.3% of our total loan and lease portfolio. Commercial real estate and commercial business loans generally are considered riskier than single-family residential loans because they have larger balances to a single borrower or group of related borrowers. Commercial real estate and commercial business loans involve risks because the borrowers\u2019 ability to repay the loans typically depends primarily on the successful operation of the businesses or the properties securing the loans. Most of the Bank\u2019s commercial real estate and commercial business loans are made to small business or middle market customers who may have a heightened vulnerability to economic conditions. Moreover, a portion of these loans have been made by us in recent years and the borrowers may not have experienced a complete business or economic cycle. Furthermore, the deterioration of our borrowers\u2019 businesses may hinder their ability to repay their loans with us, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\u2022 Our business is subject to interest rate risk, and variations in interest rates may negatively affect our financial performance.\nChanges in the interest rate environment may reduce our net interest income. It is expected that we will continue to realize income from the differential or \u201cmargin\u201d between the interest earned on loans, securities and other interest-earning assets, and interest paid on deposits, borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margins are affected by the difference between the maturities and repricing characteristics of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. In addition, loan volume and yields are affected by market interest rates on loans, and rising interest rates generally are associated with a lower volume of loan originations. We may be unable to minimize our interest rate risk. In addition, an increase in the general level of interest rates may adversely affect the ability of certain borrowers to pay the interest on and principal of their obligations. Accordingly, changes in levels of market interest rates could materially and adversely affect our net interest margin, asset quality, and loan origination volume.\n\u2022 Governmental monetary policies and intervention to stabilize the U.S. financial system may affect our business and are beyond our control.\nThe business of banking is affected significantly by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies. Such policies are beyond our control. We are particularly affected by the policies established by the Federal Reserve Board in relation to the supply of money and credit in the United States. The instruments of monetary policy available to the Federal Reserve Board can be used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and deposits, as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits, and this can and does have a material effect on our business.\nThe Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (the \u201cEESA\u201d), signed into law on October 3, 2008, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the \u201cARRA\u201d), signed into law on February 17, 2009, and other legislation was intended to help stabilize the U.S. financial system by improving the credit, capital and liquidity problems confronting the financial system. Many provisions of the Dodd Frank Act, signed into law on July 21, 2010, have also been implemented as part of the continuing stabilization effort. However, a continuation or worsening of such economic conditions could limit our access to capital or sources of liquidity in amounts and at times necessary to conduct operations in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.\n\u2022 The Bank faces strong competition from banks, financial service companies and other companies that offer banking services, which could adversely affect our business.\nIncreased competition in our market may result in reduced loans and deposits or the rates charged or paid on these instruments and adversely affect our net interest margin. Ultimately, we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. Many competitors offer similar banking services compared to those that are offered by the Bank in its service area. These competitors include national and super-regional banks, finance companies, investment banking and brokerage firms, credit unions, government-assisted farm credit programs, other community banks and technology-oriented financial institutions offering online services. In particular, the Bank\u2019s competitors include several major financial companies whose greater resources may afford them a marketplace advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous banking locations and mount extensive promotional and advertising campaigns. Additionally, banks and other financial institutions with larger capitalization and financial intermediaries not subject to bank regulatory restrictions have larger lending limits than we do and are thereby better able to serve the credit needs of larger customers. Areas of competition include interest rates for loans and deposits, efforts to obtain loans and deposits, as well as the range and quality of products and services provided, including new technology-driven products and services. Technological innovation continues to contribute to greater competition in domestic and international financial services markets as technological advances, such as Internet-based banking services that cross traditional geographic bounds, enable more companies to provide financial services. If the Bank is unable to attract and retain banking customers, we may be unable to maintain our historical levels of loans and leases and deposits or our net interest margin.\n\u2022 Our operations are dependent upon key personnel.\nOur future prospects are and will remain highly dependent on our directors, executive officers and other key personnel. Our success will, to some extent, depend on the continued service of our directors and continued employment of the executive officers, in addition to our ability to attract and retain experienced banking professionals to serve us and the Bank in other key positions. The unexpected loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on our business.\n\u2022 Technology implementation problems or computer system failures could adversely affect us.\nOur future growth prospects will be highly dependent on the ability of the Bank to implement changes in technology that affect the delivery of banking services such as the increased demand for computer access to bank accounts and the availability to perform banking transactions electronically. The Bank\u2019s ability to compete will depend upon its ability to continue to adapt technology on a timely and cost-effective basis to meet such demands. In addition, our business and operations and those of the Bank could be susceptible to adverse effects from computer failures, communication and energy disruption, and activities such as fraud of unethical individuals with the technological ability to cause disruptions or failures of the Bank\u2019s data processing system.\n\u2022 Cybersecurity breaches or other technological difficulties could adversely affect us.\nWe cannot be certain that the continued implementation of safeguards will eliminate the risk of vulnerability to technological difficulties or failures or ensure the absence of a breach of information security, including as a result of cybersecurity breach. The FDIC has recently highlighted in its Supervisory Insights publication that cybersecurity is a critical challenge facing the financial services industry and that the frequency and sophistication of cyber-attacks are increasing. The Bank will continue to enhance its information security programs consistent with regulatory requirements including reliance on the services of various vendors who provide data processing and communication services to the financial services industry. Nonetheless, if information security is compromised or other technology difficulties or failures occur at the Bank or with one of our vendors, information may be lost or misappropriated, services and operations may be interrupted and the Bank could be exposed to claims from its customers as a result.\n\u2022 Our controls over financial reporting and related governance procedures may fail or be circumvented.\nManagement regularly reviews and updates our internal control over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. We maintain controls and procedures to mitigate risks such as processing system failures or errors and customer or employee fraud, and we maintain insurance coverage for certain of these risks. Any system of controls and procedures, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and provides only reasonable, not absolute, certainty that the objectives of the system will be met. Events could occur which are not prevented or detected by our internal controls, are not insured against, or are in excess of our insurance limits. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures, or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures, could have an adverse effect on our business.\n\u2022 We may not be successful in raising additional capital needed in the future.\nIf additional capital is needed in the future as a result of losses, our business strategy or regulatory requirements, our efforts to raise such additional capital may be unsuccessful or shares sold in the future may be sold at prices or on terms that are not equal to or better than the current market price. The inability to raise additional capital when needed or at prices and terms acceptable to us could adversely affect our ability to implement our business strategies.\n\u2022 The effects of legislation in response to credit conditions may adversely affect us.\nLegislation that has or may be passed at the federal level and/or by the State of California in response to conditions affecting credit markets could cause us to experience higher credit losses if such legislation reduces the amount that the Bank\u2019s borrowers are otherwise contractually required to pay under existing loan contracts. Such legislation could also result in the imposition of limitations upon the Bank\u2019s ability to foreclose on property or other collateral or make foreclosure less economically feasible. Such events could result in increased loan and lease losses and require a material increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses.\n\u2022 The effects of changes to FDIC insurance coverage limits and assessments are uncertain and increased premiums may adversely affect us.\nFDIC insurance premium assessments are uncertain and increased premium assessments may adversely affect our earnings. The FDIC charges insured financial institutions premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund (\u201cDIF\u201d). Recent economic conditions have resulted and may continue to result in bank failures. In such event, the FDIC may take control of failed institutions and guarantee payment from the DIF up to the insured limit for deposits held at such failed institutions. Depending on any future losses that the DIF may suffer due to failed institutions, there may be additional premium increases in order to replenish the DIF.\nOn November 9, 2010, the FDIC issued a final rule implementing section 343 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) that made permanent a $250,000 deposit insurance limit per depositor and also provided unlimited insurance coverage for noninterest-bearing transaction accounts. This unlimited insurance coverage was not extended and terminated on December 31, 2012. The $250,000 maximum deposit insurance amount per depositor remains in effect.\nIn addition, the Dodd-Frank Act also made other deposit insurance changes which may affect our insurance premium assessments to include (i) amendment of the assessment base used to calculate an insured depository institution\u2019s deposit insurance premiums paid to the DIF by elimination of deposits and substitution of average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity during the assessment period as the revised assessment base; (ii) increasing the minimum designated reserve ratio of the DIF from 1.15 percent to 1.35 percent of the estimated amount of total insured deposits; (iii) eliminating the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds; and (iv) repeal of the prohibition upon the payment of interest on demand deposits to be effective one year after the date of enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act. In December 2010, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC increased the designated reserve ratio of the DIF to 2.0 percent effective January 1, 2011, which has remained in effect.\nOn November 18, 2014, the FDIC adopted the Assessments Final Rule which revises the FDIC\u2019s risk-based deposit insurance assessment system to reflect changes in the regulatory capital rules that were effective commencing January 1, 2015. For smaller financial institutions such as the Bank (with total assets less than $1 Billion and which are not custodial banks), the Final Rule revises and conforms capital ratios and ratio thresholds to the new prompt corrective action capital ratios and ratio thresholds for \u201cwell capitalized\u201d and \u201cadequately capitalized\u201d evaluations which were adopted by the federal banking agencies as part of the so-called Basel III capital regulations.\nIt is uncertain what effect these changes will have on our future insurance assessments and costs of operations, but any increases in premium assessments will adversely impact our earnings.\n\u2022 In the future we may be required to recognize impairment with respect to investment securities, including the FHLB stock we hold.\nOur securities portfolio currently includes securities with unrecognized losses. We may continue to observe declines in the fair market value of these securities. We evaluate the securities portfolio for any other than temporary impairment each reporting period, as required by generally accepted accounting principles, and as of December 31, 2015, we did not recognize any securities as other than temporarily impaired. Future evaluations of the securities portfolio may require us to recognize an impairment charge with respect to these and other holdings. In addition, as a condition to membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (the \u201cFHLB\u201d), we are required to purchase and hold a certain amount of FHLB stock. Our stock purchase requirement is based, in part, upon the outstanding principal balance of advances from the FHLB. At December 31, 2015, we held stock in the FHLB totaling $3.8 million. The FHLB stock held by us is carried at cost and is subject to recoverability testing under applicable accounting standards. The FHLB currently distributes cash dividends on its shares, however, past dividend paying practices are not a guarantee of future dividends. To date, we have not recognized any impairment charges related to our FHLB stock holdings. Any future negative changes to the financial condition of the FHLB may require us to recognize an impairment charge with respect to such holdings.\n\u2022 If the goodwill we have recorded in connection with our acquisition of Bank of Amador becomes impaired, it could have an adverse impact on our earnings and capital.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had approximately $16.3 million of goodwill on our balance sheet attributable to our merger with Bank of Amador in December 2004. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, our goodwill is not amortized but rather evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment exists. Such evaluation is based on a variety of factors, including the quoted price of our common stock, market prices of the common stock of other banking organizations, common stock trading multiples, discounted cash flows, and data from comparable acquisitions. Future evaluations of goodwill may result in findings of impairment and write-downs, which could be material.\n\u2022 The effects of terrorism and other events beyond our control may adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe terrorist actions on September 11, 2001 and thereafter, as well as the military conflicts in the Middle East, have had significant adverse effects upon the United States economy. Whether terrorist activities in the future and the actions of the United States and its allies in combating terrorism on a worldwide basis will adversely impact us and the extent of such impact is uncertain. Similar events beyond our control including, but not limited to, financial and economic instability and governmental actions in response, natural disasters such as earthquakes, droughts, floods, fires, and similar adverse weather occurrences, disruption of power supplies and communications equipment such as telephones, cellular phones, computers, and other forms of electronic equipment or media, and widespread, adverse public health occurrences, may adversely affect our future results of operations by, among other things, disrupting the conduct of our operations and those of our customers, which could result in a reduction in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by the Bank, increase non-performing loans and the amounts reserved for loan and lease losses, or cause significant declines in our level of deposits.\n\u2022 Future acquisitions and expansion activities may disrupt our business and adversely affect our operating results.\nWe regularly evaluate potential acquisitions and expansion opportunities. To the extent that we grow through acquisitions, we cannot ensure that we will be able to adequately or profitably manage this growth. Acquiring other banks, branches or other assets, as well as other expansion activities, involves various risks including the risks of incorrectly assessing the credit quality of acquired assets, encountering greater than expected costs of incorporating acquired banks or branches into the Bank, executing cost savings measures, and being unable to profitably deploy funds in an acquisition.\n\u2022 We may raise additional capital, which could have a dilutive effect on the existing holders of our common stock and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn December 2009, the Company raised $25.3 million (in gross proceeds) in a public offering of 4,048,000 shares of its common stock at $6.25 per share. Our articles of incorporation, as amended, provide the authority to issue without further shareholder approval, 20,000,000 shares of common stock, no par value per share, of which 7,343,649 shares were issued and outstanding at December 31, 2015. Pursuant to the Company\u2019s 2010 Equity Incentive Plan and its 2000 Stock Option Plan, at December 31, 2015, employees and directors of the Company had outstanding options to purchase 248,411 shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2015, 1,395,985 shares of common stock remained available for awards under the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan.\nWe are not restricted from issuing additional shares of common stock or securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock. We frequently evaluate opportunities to access the capital markets taking into account our regulatory capital ratios, financial condition and other relevant considerations, and subject to market conditions, we may take further capital actions. Such actions could include, among other things, the issuance of additional shares of common stock in public or private transactions in order to further increase our capital levels above the requirements for a well capitalized institution established by the federal bank regulatory agencies as well as other regulatory targets.\nThe issuance of any additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock or that represent the right to receive common stock, or the exercise of such securities including, without limitation, securities issued upon exercise of outstanding equity awards under our 2010 Equity Incentive Plan or outstanding options under our 2000 Stock Option Plan, could be substantially dilutive to shareholders of our common stock. Holders of our shares of common stock have no preemptive rights that entitle holders to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series and, therefore, such sales or offerings could result in increased dilution to our shareholders. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of shares of our common stock or the perception that such sales could occur.\n\u2022 The price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, and this may make it difficult for shareholders to resell shares of common stock they own at times or at prices they find attractive.\nThe stock market and, in particular, the market for financial institution stocks, has experienced significant volatility, which reached unprecedented levels during the economic downturn of 2007 through 2010. In some cases, the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices for certain issuers without regard to those issuers\u2019 underlying financial strength. As a result, the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate more than usual and cause significant price variations to occur. This may make it difficult for shareholders to resell shares of common stock they own at times or at prices they find attractive. The low trading volume in our common shares on the NASDAQ Global Select Market means that our shares may have less liquidity than other publicly traded companies. We cannot ensure that the volume of trading in our common shares will be maintained or will increase in the future.\nThe trading price of the shares of our common stock will depend on many factors, which may change from time to time and which may be beyond our control, including, without limitation, our financial condition, performance, creditworthiness and prospects, future sales or offerings of our equity or equity related securities, and other factors identified above in the forward-looking statement discussion in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading \u201cCautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and below. These broad market fluctuations have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Among the factors that could affect our stock price are:\n\u2022 actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition;\n\u2022 changes in financial estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts or actions taken by rating agencies with respect to our common stock or those of other financial institutions;\n\u2022 failure to meet analysts\u2019 revenue or earnings estimates;\n\u2022 speculation in the press or investment community generally or relating to our reputation, our market area, our competitors or the financial services industry in general;\n\u2022 strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, restructurings, dispositions or financings;\n\u2022 actions by our current shareholders, including sales of common stock by existing shareholders and/or directors and executive officers;\n\u2022 fluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors;\n\u2022 future sales of our equity, equity-related or debt securities;\n\u2022 changes in the frequency or amount of dividends or share repurchases;\n\u2022 proposed or adopted regulatory changes or developments;\n\u2022 anticipated or pending investigations, proceedings, or litigation that involves or affects us;\n\u2022 trading activities in our common stock, including short-selling;\n\u2022 domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance; and\n\u2022 general U.S. and international market conditions and, in particular, developments related to market conditions for the financial services industry.\nA significant decline in our stock price could result in substantial losses for individual shareholders.\n\u2022 We may be unable or choose not to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nOur ability to pay dividends on our common stock depends on a variety of factors. On July 27, 2009 we announced suspension of our quarterly dividends, which remains in effect. The Company relies on distributions from the Bank in the form of cash dividends in order to pay cash dividends to our shareholders. Cash dividends may or may not be paid in the future since they are subject to regulatory restrictions and to evaluation by our Board of Directors of financial factors including, but not limited to, our earnings, financial condition and capital requirements.\n\u2022 Anti-takeover provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws and California law could make a third party acquisition of us difficult.\nOur articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us (even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders) and for holders of our common stock to receive any related takeover premium for their common stock. We are also subject to certain provisions of California law that would delay, deter or prevent a change in control of the Company. These provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 88719, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "AMRB"}
