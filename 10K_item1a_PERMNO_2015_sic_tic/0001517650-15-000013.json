{"cik": "1517650", "company": "Interactive Intelligence Group, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A.Risk Factors.\nThe following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and presented elsewhere by management from time to time. Such factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and you should carefully consider them. Additional risk and uncertainties not presently known to us or which are currently not believed to be material may also affect our actual results. Because of these and other factors, past performance should not be considered an indication of future performance.\nOur Quarterly Operating Results Have Varied Significantly\nOur operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and depend on a number of factors affecting us or our industry, including many that are beyond our control. As a result, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied on as an indication of our future performance. In addition, our operating results in a future quarter or quarters may fall below expectations of securities analysts or investors and, as a result, the price of our common stock may fluctuate.\nOur quarterly revenues and operating results depend on many factors, including whether the deployment is on-premises or cloud-based, the type of license, the size, quantity and timing of orders received for our solutions during each quarter, the delivery of the related software or hardware and our expectations regarding collection. Because we do not know if or when our partners and current or potential customers will place orders and finalize license agreements, we may not be able to accurately forecast our licensing activity, our revenues and our operating results for future quarters. We have generally experienced a lengthy initial sales cycle, which can last six to nine months and sometimes longer. The lengthy sales cycle is one of the factors that has caused, and may in the future continue to cause, our product revenues and operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter which may in turn affect the market price of our common stock. Because of the unique characteristics of our solutions and our prospective customers\u2019 internal evaluation processes, decisions to license our solutions often require significant time and executive-level decision making. As a result, sales cycles for customer orders vary substantially from customer to customer. The length of the sales cycle for customer orders depends on a number of other factors over which we have little or no control, including:\n\u00b7\na customer\u2019s budgetary constraints;\n\u00b7\nthe timing of a customer\u2019s budget cycle;\n\u00b7\nconcerns by customers about the introduction of new solutions by us or our competitors; and\n\u00b7\ndownturns in general economic conditions, including reductions in demand for contact center services.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOur limited number of solutions, changes in pricing policies, the timing of development completion, announcement and sale of new or upgraded versions of our solutions and the effect of cloud-based deployments on recognizing revenues are some of the additional factors that could cause our revenues and operating results to vary significantly from period to period.\nWe recognize revenues from different licenses over different periods depending on the satisfaction of the requirements of relevant accounting literature, including FASB ASC Topic 985, Software (\u201cFASB ASC 985\u201d), and FASB ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition (\u201cFASB ASC 605\u201d).\nA large portion of our operating expenses, including salaries and rent, is fixed and difficult to reduce or modify in a short time period. As a result, our financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected if revenues do not meet our expectations.\nBecause We Recognize Recurring Revenue Over the Term of the Applicable Agreement, the Lack of Recurring Renewals or New Service Agreements May Not Be Reflected Immediately in our Operating Results. As Our Business Continues to Shift Toward a Greater Number of Cloud-Based Orders, This May Have a Greater Impact on Our Operating Results.\nAs we continue to shift toward a cloud offering model, it is increasingly difficult to demonstrate period-over-period revenue growth because revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable contract terms. As a result, a portion of our quarterly revenue is attributable to service agreements entered into during previous quarters. A decline in new or renewed service agreements or significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our services in any one quarter will not be fully reflected in our revenue and operating results in that quarter but will negatively impact our revenue and operating results in future quarters.\nOur Future Business Prospects Depend in Part on Our Ability to Maintain and Improve Our Current Solutions and Develop New Solutions\nWe believe that our future business prospects depend in large part on our ability to maintain and improve our current solutions and to develop new solutions and services on a timely basis. Our solutions and services will have to continue to achieve market acceptance, maintain technological competitiveness and meet an expanding range of customer requirements. As a result of the complexities inherent in our solutions, major new solutions and solution enhancements require long development and testing periods. We may not be successful in developing and marketing, on a timely and cost effective basis, solution enhancements or new solutions that respond to technological change, evolving industry standards or customer requirements. We may also experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction or marketing of solution enhancements, and our new solutions and solution enhancements may not achieve market acceptance. Significant delays in the general availability of new releases of our solutions and services or significant problems in the installation or implementation of new releases of our solutions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur Solutions Could Have Defects for Which We Are Potentially Liable and Which Could Result in Loss of Revenue, Increased Costs, Loss of Our Credibility, Harm Our Reputation or Delay in Acceptance of Our Solutions in the Market\nOur solutions, including components supplied by others, may contain errors or defects, especially when first introduced or when new versions are released. Despite internal product testing, we have in the past discovered software errors in some of our solutions after their introduction. Errors in new solutions or releases could be found after commencement of commercial shipments, and this could result in additional development costs, diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts, or the loss of credibility with current or future customers. This could result in a loss of revenue or delay in market acceptance of our solutions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential solution liability and certain claims. However, not all of these agreements contain these types of provisions and, where present, these provisions vary as to their terms and may not be effective under the laws of some jurisdictions. A product liability, warranty, or other claim brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur solutions are developed to run on the Microsoft\u00ae Windows\u00ae operating system and use one or more media servers for voice (telephone call) processing and recording. Our server solutions also operate in a network environment with database servers, email servers, and third-party systems such as CRM solutions, Microsoft\u00ae Lync\u00ae Server 2010 and Amazon Web Services for our PureCloud Platform. As a cloud-based solution, our solutions can be deployed as a cloud offering via wide area networks. Because of this complexity, our solutions may be more prone to performance interruptions for our customers than traditional hardware-based solutions. Performance interruptions at our customer sites, some of which currently do not have back-up systems, could affect demand for our solutions or give rise to claims against us.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe Overall Economic Climate Could Result in Decreased Demand for Our Products and Services\nOur solutions typically represent substantial capital commitments by customers and involve a potentially long sales cycle. As a result, our operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and their impact on customer purchasing decisions. Given the current economic conditions, current and potential customers are more cognizant of their budgets for communication solutions, services and systems, which may result in our current or prospective customers delaying and/or reducing their capital spending related to information systems. Some of the factors that could influence the levels of spending by our current or prospective customers include availability of credit, labor and healthcare costs, consumer confidence and other factors affecting spending behavior. These and other economic factors could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services and on our financial condition and operating results.\nIf Our Customers Do Not Perceive Our Solutions or the Related Services and Support Provided by Us or Our Partners to Be Effective or of High Quality, Our Brand and Name Recognition Will Suffer\nWe believe that establishing and maintaining brand and name recognition is critical for attracting, retaining and expanding customers in our target markets. We also believe that the importance of reputation and name recognition will increase as competition in our market increases. Promotion and enhancement of our name will depend on the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising efforts and on our success in providing high-quality solutions and related services, including installation, training and maintenance, none of which can be assured. If our customers do not perceive our solutions or related services to be effective or of high quality, our brand and name recognition would suffer which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur Business Depends Substantially on Customers Renewing, Upgrading and Expanding Their Recurring Contracts for Our Services. Any Decline in Our Customer Renewals, Upgrades and Expansions Would Harm Our Future Operating Results.\nWe sell maintenance contracts with our on-premises solutions, which are typically one year in length. In addition, subscriptions for our cloud solution have historically been three to five years in length. Our customers have no obligation to renew their cloud subscriptions or on-premises maintenance contracts after their contract period expires, and they may not renew at the same or higher levels. In the first year of a subscription, customers often purchase a higher level of professional services than they do in subsequent years. As a result, our ability to grow our services revenues is dependent in part on customers purchasing additional services after the first year of their cloud subscriptions. We may not accurately predict future trends in customer renewals. Our customers\u2019 renewal rates may decline or fluctuate because of several factors, including their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our services, the prices of our services, the prices of services offered by our competitors or reductions in our customers\u2019 spending levels due to the macroeconomic environment or other factors. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our services, renew on less favorable terms, or do not purchase additional functionality or subscriptions, our revenue may grow more slowly than expected or decline and our profitability and gross margin may be harmed.\nWe Face Competitive Pressures, Which May Affect Us Adversely\nThe market for our solutions is highly competitive and, because there are relatively low barriers to entry in the software market, we expect competitive pressures to continue to be a risk to our ongoing success in the market. In addition, because our industry is evolving and characterized by rapid technological change, it is difficult for us to predict whether, when and by whom new competing technologies or new competitors may be introduced into our markets. Currently, our competition comes from several different market segments, including computer telephony platform developers, computer telephony solutions software developers and telecommunications equipment vendors. Additionally, alternative deployment strategies, such as cloud-based services, are offered by other companies. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against current and future competitors in these market segments, or in new market segments with new types of competitors. In addition, increased competition or other competitive pressures may result in price reductions, reduced margins or loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nMany of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater resources, greater name recognition and a larger installed base of customers than we do. Competitors may be able to respond to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements more effectively than we can, or devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of solutions than we can. In addition, for a number of our larger competitors, the product segment in which they currently compete with us is a small portion of their overall offering. These competitors might be willing and able to dramatically cut prices in our segment in order to protect or grow other segments that are more important to their overall business. Current and potential competitors have established, and may in the future establish, cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties,\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nincluding mergers or acquisitions, to increase the ability of their products to address the needs of our current or prospective customers. If these competitors were to acquire significantly increased market share, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur Cloud Solutions Present Execution and Competitive Risks\nWe are devoting significant resources to extend our current cloud solutions and our PureCloud Platform, which is and will continue to be materially dependent upon hardware infrastructure and licensed software that are owned by third parties. There can be no assurance that such third parties will continue to support and maintain their products and services. In addition to certain software development costs, we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services. These costs have negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact our operating margins.\nCertain new competitors offer alternative cloud-based services for consumers and business customers. While we believe our expertise, investments in infrastructure, and the breadth of our cloud-based services provide us with a solid foundation to compete, it is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to be successful. Whether we are successful in our business model depends on our execution in a number of areas, including:\n\u00b7\ncontinuing to innovate and bring to market compelling cloud-based experiences that generate increasing orders;\n\u00b7\nimproving the performance of our cloud-based services; and\n\u00b7\ncontinuing to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud-based platforms to partners.\nA Failure or Compromise of Our Information Security Measures Could Result in Substantial Harm to Our Reputation, Daily Operations, or Profitability\nWe utilize web-based systems and applications to process new orders and to provide support services to our customers and partners. Because these systems are Internet-facing, they are necessarily subject to a variety of cyber-attacks, which, if successful, could disrupt our ability to process new orders and our ability to provide support services effectively. Additionally, we house corporate intellectual property and varying amounts of sensitive customer information on our private network.\nWe have implemented technical and administrative controls designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of these systems and the data they house. We have also implemented commercially available products and system tools designed to monitor, detect and/or prevent cyber-attacks and other malicious activity that may occur on our systems. Additionally, we have developed and implemented processes to respond to and mitigate identified issues quickly and effectively.\nIf these security measures fail, are compromised or we fail to detect and mitigate any such compromise promptly, it could result in the loss of intellectual property, the breach of sensitive customer information entrusted to our care, damage to our reputation, disruption of routine operations, and/or significant financial expense related to the mitigation or response to, or litigation resulting from, any particular issue.\nIn the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, we did not experience any events, either individually or in aggregate, of a material nature or that resulted in any material financial impact or any material loss or exposure of sensitive data.\nIndustry-specific and Internet Regulation is Evolving and Unfavorable Industry-specific Laws or New Regulation of the Internet by Governmental Agencies Could Harm Our Business.\nOur customers and potential customers do business in a variety of industries. Regulators in certain industries have adopted, and may in the future adopt, regulations regarding the use of cloud computing and other outsourced services. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, industry-specific laws and regulations may limit customers\u2019 use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand for our services. For instance, an inability to satisfy certain voluntary third-party certification standards that our customers may expect, such as an attestation of compliance with the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards, may have an adverse effect on our business. If in the future we are unable to achieve or maintain these industry-specific certifications or other requirements or standards relevant to our customers, it may adversely affect our sales and/or reputation. In some cases, industry-specific laws or regulations may also apply directly to us as a service provider. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such requirements could have an adverse effect on our business.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nRegulations related to the Internet could also affect our ability to provide our services. Congress has adopted legislation that regulates certain aspects of the Internet including online content, user privacy, taxation and liability for third-party activities. This legislation, as well as other pending legislation, may have the effect of raising the cost of doing business on the Internet. Federal, state, local and foreign governmental organizations are considering other legislative and regulatory proposals that would regulate and/or tax applications running over the Internet. We cannot predict whether new taxes will be imposed on our services, and depending on the type of taxes imposed, whether and how our services would be affected thereafter. Increased regulation of the Internet may decrease its growth and hinder technological development, which may negatively impact the cost of doing business via the Internet or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMalicious Human Actions, Catastrophic Events or Disruption of Service at Our Data Centers May Disrupt Our Operations, Affect Our Operating Results and/or Delay Our Ability to Deliver Our Service to Our Customers\nWe utilize third-party hosting facilities to provide services and support to our cloud customers from a variety of data centers around the world. We do not have sole control over the operations of these facilities. These facilities, along with our systems and operations, are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, telecommunications failures and similar events. The occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in our services, causing delays in completing sales, providing services or performing other mission-critical functions. The facilities also could be subject to break-ins, cyber-attacks, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and other misconduct and malicious activity.\nThe continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat, or any future acts of terrorism, may also cause further disruptions to the economies of the United States and other countries and create further uncertainties or otherwise materially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. Likewise, events such as widespread blackouts could have similar negative impacts. To the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the manufacture or shipment of our solutions, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nDestruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems or a significant interruption, disruption, or other performance problem with our service may harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and our operating results. This could reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to terminate service and adversely affect our renewal rates and our ability to attract new customers.\nOur Inability to Successfully Manage our Increasingly Complex Supplier and Other Third-Party Relationships Could Adversely Affect Us\nAs the complexity of our product technology and our supplier and other third-party relationships have increased, the management of those relationships and the negotiation of contractual terms sufficient to protect our rights and limit our potential liabilities have become more complicated, and we expect this trend to continue in the future. In addition, because we offer a whole product solution, this has added complexity to our supplier relationships. We license technology from third parties that is embedded in our products, making aspects of our business reliant upon those third parties. Some of these third parties that license technology to us are our competitors, or could become competitive with us in the future. Certain license agreements permit either party to terminate all or a portion of the license without cause at any time. Further, some of the license agreements provide that upon acquisition of us by certain other third parties, we would have to pay a significant fee to continue the license. As a result, our inability to successfully manage these relationships or negotiate sufficient contractual terms could have a material adverse effect on us.\nFor certain of our orders, we supply hardware to support the implementation of our solutions. We are dependent upon third parties for the supply of hardware components to our customers. If these hardware distributors experience financial, operational or quality assurance difficulties, or if there is any other disruption in our relationships, we may be required to locate alternative hardware sources. We are also subject to the following risks related to our hardware distribution system:\n\u00b7\ncancellations of orders or delays in delivering orders due to unavailability of hardware;\n\u00b7\nincreased hardware prices, which may reduce our gross profit or make our products less price competitive;\n\u00b7\nadditional development expense to modify our products to work with new hardware configurations; and\n\u00b7\nperformance issues resulting from product changes by our hardware suppliers.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe cannot assure you that we would be able to develop or locate alternative technology (including in situations where licensors cease to support and maintain what we license), or locate alternative hardware sources in a timely manner, on terms favorable to us, or at all. Even if we and/or our distributors are successful in locating alternative sources of supply, alternative suppliers could increase prices significantly. In addition, alternative technology or hardware components may malfunction or have interoperability issues that do not currently exist. The use of new suppliers and/or technology and the modification of our products to function with new technology and/or systems would require testing and may require further modifications which may result in additional expense; diversion of management attention and other resources; inability to fulfill customer orders or delay in fulfillment; reduction in quality and reliability; customer dissatisfaction; and other adverse effects on our reputation, business and operating results.\nExisting and New Reseller Partners are Important to Continued Growth\nOur ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend in part on our success in maintaining productive relationships with our existing and future reseller partners and in recruiting and training additional reseller partners. We rely primarily on these partners to market and support our solutions and plan on continuing to rely heavily on such partners in the future. We continue to expand our partner and distribution networks and may be unable to attract additional partners with both voice and data expertise or appropriate partners that will be able to market our solutions effectively and that will be qualified to provide timely and cost-effective customer support and service. We generally do not have long-term or exclusive agreements with our partners, and the loss of specific larger partners or a significant number of partners could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, due to the current economic conditions, the risk of failure of a specific partner or a significant number of partners is increased, which failure could also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe Have Experienced Rapid Growth in Recent Periods. If We Fail to Manage Our Growth Effectively, We May Be Unable to Execute Our Business Plan, Maintain High Levels of Service or Address Competitive Challenges Adequately.\nOur expansion has placed, and our anticipated growth may continue to place, a significant strain on our managerial, administrative, operational, financial and other resources. We intend to further expand our overall business, customer base, headcount and operations, including internationally. Growing a global organization and managing a geographically dispersed workforce will require substantial management effort and significant additional investment in our infrastructure. We will be required to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting procedures and we may not be able to do so effectively. As such, we may be unable to manage our expenses effectively in the future, which may negatively impact our gross margin or operating expenses in any particular quarter.\nIf We Are Unable to Maintain the Compatibility of Our Software With Certain Other Products and Technologies, Our Future Business Would be Adversely Affected\nOur solutions must integrate with software and hardware solutions provided by a number of our existing and potential competitors. For example, our solutions must integrate with phone switches made by the telephone switch vendors and computer telephony software solutions offered by other software providers. These competitors or their business partners could alter their products so that our solutions no longer integrate well with them, or they could delay or deny our access to software releases that allow us to timely adapt our solutions to integrate with their products. If we cannot adapt our solutions to changes in necessary technology, it may significantly impair our ability to compete effectively, particularly if our solutions must integrate with the software and hardware solutions of our competitors.\nOur Solutions Require Wide Area Networks and Internet, and We May be Unable to Sell Our Solutions Where Networks Do Not Perform Adequately\nOur solutions also depend on the reliable performance of the wide area networks of businesses and organizations, including those that employ remote and mobile workers. If enterprise customers experience inadequate performance with their wide area networks, whether due to outages, component failures, or otherwise, our solution performance would be adversely affected. As a result, when these types of problems occur with these networks, our enterprise customers may not be able to immediately identify the source of the problem, and may conclude that the problem is related to our solutions. This could harm our relationships with our current enterprise customers and make it more difficult to attract new enterprise customers, which could negatively affect our business.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe May Not Be Able to Protect Our Proprietary Rights Adequately, Which Could Allow Third Parties to Copy or Otherwise Obtain and Use Our Technology Without Authorization\nWe regard our solutions as proprietary. In an effort to protect our proprietary rights, we rely primarily on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as patents, licensing and other agreements with consultants, suppliers, partners and customers, and employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements. These laws and agreements provide only limited protection of our proprietary rights. It may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization. A third party could also develop similar technology independently. In addition, the laws of some countries in which we license our solutions do not protect our solutions and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Unauthorized copying, use or reverse engineering of our solutions could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nSpecific, Negotiated Provisions in Agreements May Expose Us to Liability That Is Not Limited in Amount By the Terms of the Contract\nCertain contract provisions, principally confidentiality and indemnification obligations in certain of our license agreements, could expose us to risks of loss that, in some cases, are not limited by contract to a specified maximum amount but are generally limited by various pre-conditions to coverage. We could be subject to additional liability and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if those seeking to enforce these contract provisions are successful in their assertions.\nInfringement Claims Could Adversely Affect Us\nThird parties have claimed and may in the future claim that our technology infringes their proprietary rights. As the number of solutions in our target markets increases and the functionality of these solutions overlap, we believe that software developers may face additional infringement claims.\nInfringement claims, even if without merit, can be time consuming and expensive to defend. A third party asserting infringement claims against us or our customers with respect to our current or future solutions may require us to enter into costly royalty arrangements or litigation, or otherwise materially adversely affect us.\nWe Depend on Key Personnel and Must Retain and Recruit Skilled Personnel, for Which Competition Is Intense\nOur success depends in large part on the continued service of our key personnel, particularly Dr. Donald E. Brown, our Chief Executive Officer and largest shareholder. The loss of the services of Dr. Brown or other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our future success also depends on our ability to attract, train, assimilate and retain additional qualified personnel. Competition for persons with skills in the software industry is intense, particularly for those with relevant technical and/or sales experience. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our key employees or that we can attract, train, assimilate or retain other highly qualified personnel in the future.\nOur International Operations Involve Financial and Operational Risks Which May Adversely Affect Our Business and Operating Results\nOur international operations require significant management attention and financial resources to establish and operate, including hiring appropriate personnel and recruiting effective international partners. Non-North American revenues accounted for 32%, 28% and 30% of our total revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. We intend to continue to emphasize our international operations and we may enter additional international markets. Revenues from international operations may be inadequate to cover the expenses of those operations. Risks inherent in our international business activities may include the following:\n\u00b7\neconomic and political instability;\n\u00b7\nunexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements and laws;\n\u00b7\ntariffs and other trade barriers;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u00b7\ntiming, cost and potential difficulty of adapting our solutions to the local language in those foreign countries that do not use the English alphabet, such as Japan, Korea and China;\n\u00b7\nlack of acceptance of our solutions in foreign countries;\n\u00b7\nlonger sales cycles and accounts receivable payment cycles;\n\u00b7\npotentially adverse tax consequences;\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on the repatriation of funds;\n\u00b7\nacts of terrorism; and\n\u00b7\nincreased government regulations related to increasing or reducing business activity in various countries.\nFluctuations in exchange rates between the United States dollar and other currencies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, and particularly, on our operating margins and net income. We maintain a currency hedging program to help mitigate future effects of fluctuations in the foreign exchange rates on cash and receivables. These hedging techniques may not be successful. Exchange rate fluctuations could also make our solutions more expensive than competitive solutions not subject to these fluctuations, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability in international markets.\nWe Have Made Acquisitions and May Pursue Acquisitions That Present Risks and May Not be Successful\nWe have acquired companies and in the future we may pursue acquisitions to diversify our solution offerings and customer base, to strengthen our distribution channel or for other strategic purposes. We cannot provide assurance that our recent or future acquisitions will be successful. The following are some of the risks associated with our acquisitions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations:\n\u00b7\nOur acquired businesses may not achieve anticipated revenues, earnings or cash flow.\n\u00b7\nWe may be unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and realize anticipated economic, operational and other benefits in a timely manner, particularly if we acquire a business in a market in which we have limited or no current expertise, or with a corporate culture different from our own. If we are unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully, we could incur substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical or financial problems.\n\u00b7\nAcquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business, distract management, divert resources and make it difficult to maintain our current business standards, controls and procedures.\n\u00b7\nWe may be competing with other firms, many of which have greater financial and other resources, to acquire attractive companies, making it more difficult to acquire suitable companies on acceptable terms.\n\u00b7\nWe may not generate sufficient cash from operations and our growth could be limited unless we are able to obtain capital through additional debt or equity financings. These financings may not be available as required for acquisitions or other needs, and even if financing is available, it may not be on terms that are favorable to us or sufficient for our needs. In addition, if we finance future acquisitions by issuing common stock for some or all of the purchase price, this could dilute the ownership interest of our shareholders. We may also be required to recognize expense related to intangible assets recorded in future acquisitions.\nChanges in Corporate Taxes or Adverse Outcomes Resulting from Examination of Our Income Tax Returns Could Adversely Affect Our Results\nOur provision for income taxes has been and may continue to be affected by the following:\n\u00b7\nChanges in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u00b7\nEarnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u00b7\nExpiration of or lapses in the research and development tax credit laws;\n\u00b7\nTransfer pricing adjustments including the post-acquisition integration of purchased intangible assets from certain acquisitions into our intercompany research and development cost sharing arrangement;\n\u00b7\nTax effects of nondeductible stock option expense;\n\u00b7\nTax costs related to intercompany realignments;\n\u00b7\nForeign losses not being utilized to offset future taxable income; or\n\u00b7\nChanges in tax laws, regulations and accounting principles, including accounting for uncertain tax positions or interpretations thereof.\nSignificant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIf amounts included in tax returns are increased, reduced or disallowed, it would affect our loss carryforwards and tax credits and the amount of expected future non-cash income tax expense used by management and investors. Judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes (\u201cFASB ASC 740\u201d). In addition, FASB ASC 740 applies to all income tax positions, including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes, which if settled unfavorably could adversely impact our provision for income taxes or additional paid-in capital. Further, as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain tax jurisdictions is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax. Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. We have also recorded state and local income tax incentives as a reduction of certain operating expenses and if those incentives were to be disallowed we may be required to record additional expense. In addition, we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nAs a Holding Company, Interactive Intelligence Depends in Large Part on Dividends from Its Operating Subsidiaries to Satisfy Its Obligations\nInteractive Intelligence is a holding company with no business operations of its own. Its only significant assets are the outstanding shares of capital stock of its subsidiaries. As a result, it relies on funds from its current subsidiaries and any subsidiaries that it may form in the future to meet its obligations.\nWe Are Exposed to Fluctuations in the Market Value of Our Money Market Funds and Investments. The Financial Pressure on Investment Institutions Managing Our Investments or the Failure of Such Entities May Lead to Restrictions on Access to Our Investments Which Could Negatively Impact Our Balance of Cash and Cash Equivalents, thus Affecting Our Overall Financial Condition\nWe maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings and maturities of up to three years. These securities are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value. This portfolio includes money market funds, notes, bonds and commercial paper of various issuers. If the debt of these issuers is downgraded, the carrying value of these investments could be impaired. In addition, we could also face default risk from some of these issuers, which could cause the carrying value to be impaired. Financial institutions have been under significant pressure over the past several years. Should one or more of the financial institutions managing our invested funds experience increased financial pressure resulting in bankruptcy, or the threat of bankruptcy, access to our funds may be restricted for a period of time and may also result in losses on those funds.\nOur cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase. We maintain the cash and cash equivalents with reputable major financial institutions. Deposits with these banks exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits or similar limits in foreign jurisdictions. While we monitor daily the cash\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nbalances in the operating accounts and adjust the balances as appropriate, these balances could be impacted if one or more of the financial institutions with which we deposit fails or is subject to other adverse conditions in the financial or credit markets. To date we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our invested cash or cash equivalents; however, we can provide no assurance that access to our invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial and credit markets.\nOur Stock Price Has Been and Could Continue to Be Highly Volatile\nOur stock price has been and could continue to be highly volatile due to a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u00b7\nannouncements by us, our competitors or our customers;\n\u00b7\nchanges in financial estimates of securities analysts or investors regarding us, our industry or our competitors;\n\u00b7\ntechnological innovations by others;\n\u00b7\nthe operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies or of our competitors;\n\u00b7\nthe availability for future sale, or sales, of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral market or economic conditions.\nThis risk may be heightened because our industry is continually evolving, characterized by rapid technological change, and is susceptible to the introduction of new competing technologies or competitors.\nIn addition, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in the recent past that have particularly affected the trading prices of equity securities of many technology companies, including us. These price and volume fluctuations often have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has sometimes been instituted against that company. This type of litigation, regardless of the outcome, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges Made to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and Other Legislative Changes May Impact Our Business\nRevisions to generally accepted accounting principles will require us to review our accounting and financial reporting procedures in order to ensure continued compliance with required policies. From time to time, such changes may have a short-term impact on our reporting, and these changes may impact market perception of our financial condition. In addition, legislative changes, and the perception these changes create, can have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFailure to Maintain Effective Internal Controls in Accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Business, Operating Results and Stock Price\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d) imposes certain duties on us and our executives and directors. We are also required to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Our efforts to comply with the requirements of Section 404 have resulted in increased general and administrative expense and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities, and we expect these efforts to require the continued commitment of significant resources.\nIf we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, we may not be able to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting. Failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in a material misstatement or an investigation by regulatory authorities, and could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results, investor confidence in our reported financial information, and the market price of our common stock.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nAnti-Takeover Provisions in Our Organizational Documents and Indiana Law Make Any Change in Control of Us More Difficult, May Discourage Bids at a Premium over the Market Price and May Adversely Affect the Market Price of Our Stock\nOur Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws contain provisions that may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us, may discourage bids at a premium over the market price of our common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock. These provisions include:\n\u00b7\nthe division of our board of directors into three classes serving staggered three-year terms;\n\u00b7\nremoval of directors only for cause and only upon a 66 2/3% shareholder vote;\n\u00b7\nprohibiting shareholders from calling a special meeting of shareholders;\n\u00b7\nthe ability to issue additional shares of our common stock or preferred stock without shareholders\u2019 approval; and\n\u00b7\nadvance notice requirements for raising business or making nominations at shareholders\u2019 meetings.\nThe Indiana Business Corporation Law (\u201cIBCL\u201d) contains business combination provisions that, in general, prohibit for five years any business combination with a beneficial owner of 10% or more of our common stock unless the holder\u2019s acquisition of the stock was approved in advance by our board of directors. The IBCL also contains control share acquisition provisions that limit the ability of certain shareholders to vote their shares unless their control share acquisition is approved.", "PERMNO": 87264, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "ININ"}
