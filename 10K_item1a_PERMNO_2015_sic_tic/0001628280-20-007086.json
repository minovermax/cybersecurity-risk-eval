RISK FACTORS\nWe operate in a changing environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could have a materially adverse impact on our operations. The risks described below highlight some of the factors that have affected, and in the future could affect, our operations. You should carefully consider these risks. These risks are not the only ones we may face. Additional risks and uncertainties of which we are unaware or that we currently deem immaterial also may become important factors that affect us. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks occurs, our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or any combination of the foregoing could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to the Chapter 11 Cases\nOn March 16, 2020, we filed voluntary petitions commencing the Chapter 11 Cases under the Bankruptcy Code. The Chapter 11 Cases and the Restructuring may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, the Chapter 11 Cases and the Restructuring may have a material adverse impact on the trading price, and the Plan will result in the cancellation and discharge of our securities, including our common stock. The Plan governs distributions to and the recoveries of holders of our securities.\nAs previously disclosed in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on March 16, 2020, we engaged financial and legal advisors to assist us in, among other things, analyzing various strategic financial alternatives to address our liquidity and capital structure, including strategic financial alternatives to restructure our indebtedness. These efforts led to the execution of the RSA on March 16, 2020 and the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases.\nThe Chapter 11 Cases could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. So long as the Chapter 11 Cases continue, our management may be required to spend a significant amount of time and effort dealing with the Restructuring rather than focusing exclusively on our business operations. Bankruptcy Court protection and operating as debtors in possession also may make it more difficult to retain management and the key personnel necessary to the success and growth of our business. In addition, during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases, our customers and suppliers might lose confidence in our ability to reorganize our business successfully and may seek to establish alternative commercial relationships, which may cause, among other things, our suppliers, vendors, counterparties and service providers to renegotiate the terms of our agreements, attempt to terminate their relationship with us or require financial assurances from us. Although we remain committed to providing safe, reliable IT services and we believe that we have sufficient resources to do so, customers may lose confidence in our ability to provide them the level of service they expect, resulting in a significant decline in our revenues, profitability and cash flow.\nOther significant risks include or relate to the following:\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s approval with respect to motions or other requests made to the Bankruptcy Court in the Chapter 11 Cases, including maintaining strategic control as debtor-in-possession;\n\u2022\nour ability to consummate the Plan and emerge from bankruptcy protection;\n\u2022\nthe effects of the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases on our business and the interest of various constituents, including our stockholders;\n\u2022\nincreased advisory costs to execute the Restructuring;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain relationships with suppliers, customers, employees and other third parties as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases;\n\u2022\nBankruptcy Court rulings in the Chapter 11 Cases as well as the outcome of other pending litigation and the outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases in general;\n\u2022\nthe length of time that we will operate with Chapter 11 protection and the continued availability of operating capital during the pendency of the proceedings;\n\u2022\nthird-party motions in the Chapter 11 Cases, which may interfere with our ability to consummate the Plan; and\n\u2022\nthe potential adverse effects of the Chapter 11 Cases on our liquidity and results of operations.\nFurther, under Chapter 11, transactions outside the ordinary course of business are subject to the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court, which may limit our ability to respond in a timely manner to certain events or take advantage of certain opportunities or to adapt to changing market or industry conditions.\nBecause of the risks and uncertainties associated with the Chapter 11 Cases, we cannot predict or quantify the ultimate impact that events occurring during the Chapter 11 Cases may have on our business, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, nor can we predict the ultimate impact that events occurring during the Chapter 11 Cases may have on our corporate or capital structure.\nDelays in the Chapter 11 Cases may increase the risks of our being unable to reorganize our business and emerge from bankruptcy and may increase our costs associated with the bankruptcy process.\nThe RSA contemplates the consummation of the Plan through a prepackaged plan of reorganization, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to consummate the Plan on the terms or on the timelines contemplated by the Plan. A prolonged Chapter 11 proceeding could adversely affect our relationships with customers, suppliers, landlords, vendors and employees, among other third parties, which in turn could adversely affect our business, competitive position, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations and our ability to continue as a going concern. A weakening of our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations could adversely affect our ability to implement the Plan. If we are unable to consummate the Plan, we may be forced to convert the Chapter 11 Cases into Chapter 7 proceedings and liquidate our assets.\nIn addition, the occurrence of the Effective Date of the Plan is subject to certain conditions and requirements that may not be satisfied or waived. Some of these conditions may be out of our control or subject to actions by third parties.\nThe Plan may not become effective.\nThe Plan may not become effective because it is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent (some of which are beyond our control). There can be no assurance that such conditions will be satisfied or waived and, therefore, that the Plan will become effective and that we will emerge from the Chapter 11 Cases as contemplated by the Plan. If the effective date of the Plan is delayed, we may not have sufficient cash or other sources of liquidity available to operate our business. In that case, we may need new or additional financing, which may increase the cost of consummating the Plan. There is no assurance of the terms on which such financing may be available or if such financing will be available. If the transactions contemplated by the Plan are not completed, it may become necessary to amend the Plan. The terms of any such amendment are uncertain and could result in material additional expense and result in material delays to the Chapter 11 Cases.\nWe may not be able to obtain Bankruptcy Court confirmation of the Plan or may have to modify the terms of the Plan.\nEven if the Plan is approved by each class of holders of claims and interests entitled to vote, the Bankruptcy Court, which, as a court of equity, may exercise substantial discretion and may choose not to confirm the Plan. Bankruptcy Code Section 1129 requires, among other things, a showing that confirmation of the Plan will not be followed by liquidation or the need for further financial reorganization for us, and that the value of distributions to dissenting holders of claims and interests will not be less than the value such holders would receive if we, the debtors, liquidated under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. Although we believe that the Plan will satisfy such tests, there can be no assurance that the Bankruptcy Court will reach the same conclusion.\nConfirmation of the Plan will also be subject to certain conditions. These conditions may not be met and there can be no assurance that the Consenting Lenders will agree to modify or waive such conditions. Further, changed circumstances may necessitate changes to the Plan. Any such modifications could result in less favorable treatment than the treatment currently anticipated to be included in the Plan based upon the agreed terms of the RSA and Term Sheet. Such less favorable treatment could include a distribution of property (including\nthe new common stock of reorganized INAP or another class of Warrants) to the class affected by the modification of a lesser value than currently anticipated to be included in the Plan or no distribution of property whatsoever under the Plan. Changes to the Plan may also delay the confirmation of the Plan and our emergence from bankruptcy, which could result in, among other things, incurred costs and expenses.\nEven if the Plan or another Chapter 11 plan of reorganization is consummated, we may not be able to achieve our stated goals and continue as a going concern.\nEven if the Plan, or any other plan of reorganization, is consummated, we may continue to face a number of risks, such as significant competition in the IT space, other changes in economic conditions, whether as a result of COVID-19 or other factors, changes in our industry, changes in demand for our services and increasing expenses. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that the Plan, or any other plan of reorganization, will achieve our stated goals.\nFurthermore, even if we implement the Restructuring with the goal of adjusting our balance sheet through the Plan or another plan of reorganization, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing or other various means to fund our business after the completion of the Chapter 11 Cases. Our access to additional financing may be limited, if it is available at all. Therefore, adequate funds may not be available when needed or may not be available on favorable terms.\nThe Plan or another plan of reorganization that we may implement will be based upon assumptions and analyses developed by us. If these assumptions and analyses prove to be incorrect, we may not be able to successfully execute such plan.\nThe Plan or any other plan of reorganization that we may implement will affect both our capital structure and the ownership, structure and operation of our business and will reflect assumptions and analyses based on our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors that we consider appropriate under the circumstances. Whether actual future results and developments will be consistent with our expectations and assumptions depends on a number of factors, including but not limited to (i) our ability to appropriately adjust or otherwise change our capital structure and debt profile; (ii) our ability to obtain adequate liquidity and financing sources, if at all; (iii) our ability to maintain customers\u2019 confidence in our viability as a continuing entity and to attract and retain sufficient business from them; (iv) our ability to retain key employees; and (v) the overall strength and stability of general economic conditions and conditions of the industries in which we compete, particularly in light of the economic disruptions caused by COVID-19. The failure of any of these factors could materially adversely affect the successful reorganization of our business and our ability to implement the Plan.\nIn addition, the Plan or any other plan of reorganization, will rely upon financial projections, including with respect to revenues, capital expenditures, debt service and cash flow. Financial forecasts are necessarily speculative, and it is likely that one or more of the assumptions and estimates that are the basis of these financial forecasts will not be accurate. Accordingly, we expect that our actual financial condition and results of operations will differ, perhaps materially, from what we have anticipated. Consequently, there can be no assurance that the results or developments contemplated by any plan of reorganization we may implement will occur or, even if they do occur, that they will have the anticipated effects on us or our business or operations. The failure of any such results or developments to materialize as anticipated could materially adversely affect the successful execution of our plan of reorganization.\nOur cash flows may not provide sufficient liquidity during the Chapter 11 Cases. Our long-term liquidity requirements and the adequacy of our capital resources are difficult to predict at this time.\nOur ability to fund our operations and our capital expenditures requires a significant amount of cash. Our current principal sources of liquidity include the available borrowing capacity under our DIP Facility and cash flow generated from operations. If our cash flow from operations decreases, we may not have the ability to expend the capital necessary to maintain or improve our current operations, negatively impacting our future revenues.\nWe face uncertainty regarding the adequacy of our liquidity and capital resources and have limited, if any, access to additional financing due to, among other things, the covenants contained in our DIP Facility. In addition to the cash requirements necessary to fund ongoing operations, we have incurred significant professional fees and other costs in connection with negotiating alternatives to entering Chapter 11, eventual negotiation and preparation for the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases and negotiation of funding sources, including the DIP Facility. We expect that we will continue to incur significant professional fees and costs throughout the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases. Although we expect the Chapter 11 Cases to be completed with deliberate speed based on the milestones in the RSA, we may not be able to comply with the covenants of our DIP Facility and our cash on hand and cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to continue to fund our operations and allow us to satisfy our obligations related to the Chapter 11 Cases until we are able to emerge from the Chapter 11 Cases.\nOur liquidity, including our ability to meet our ongoing operational obligations, is dependent upon, among other things: (i) our ability to comply with the terms and conditions of our DIP Facility, (ii) our ability to comply with the terms and conditions of any order that may be entered by the Bankruptcy Court in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, (iii) our ability to maintain adequate cash on hand, (iv) our ability to generate cash flow from operations, (v) our ability to confirm and consummate the Plan or other alternative restructuring transaction and (vi) the cost, duration and outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases.\nWe may be unable to comply with restrictions or with budget, liquidity, or other covenants imposed by the agreements governing our DIP Facility. Such non-compliance could result in an event of default under the terms of the DIP Facility that, if not cured or waived, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCovenants of the DIP Facility will include general affirmative covenants, as well as negative covenants such as prohibiting us from incurring or permitting indebtedness or liens or making investments or dispositions unless specifically permitted. Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control and our failure to comply, or obtain a waiver in the event we cannot comply with a covenant, could result in an event of default under the DIP Facility and permit the lenders thereunder to accelerate the loans and otherwise exercise remedies allowable by the agreements governing the DIP Facility.\nAs a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, our historical financial information may not be indicative of our future performance, which may be volatile.\nDuring the Chapter 11 Cases, we expect our financial results to continue to be volatile as restructuring activities and expenses significantly impact our consolidated financial statements. As a result, our historical financial performance is likely not indicative of our financial performance after March 16, 2020. In addition, if we emerge from Chapter 11, the amounts reported in subsequent consolidated financial statements, if any, may materially change relative to our historical consolidated financial statements, including as a result of revisions to our operating plans pursuant to the Plan.\nTrading in our securities during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases is highly speculative and poses substantial risks. The Plan will result in the cancellation of our common stock.\nUnder the Plan, all existing equity interests in INAP common stock will be extinguished. Amounts invested by the holders of our common stock will not be recoverable and such securities will have no value. Trading prices for INAP\u2019s securities may bear little or no relationship to the actual recovery, if any, by holders of INAP\u2019s securities in the Chapter 11 Cases. INAP expects that its equity holders will experience a significant or complete loss on their investment, depending on the outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases.\nIf the RSA is terminated, our ability to confirm and consummate the Plan could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe RSA contains a number of termination events, upon the occurrence of which certain of the RSA Parties may terminate the RSA. If the RSA is terminated as to all parties thereto, each of the parties thereto will be released from its obligations in accordance with the terms of the RSA. Such termination may result in the loss of support for the Plan by the parties to the RSA, which could adversely affect our ability to confirm and consummate the Plan. If the Plan is not consummated, there can be no assurance that the Chapter 11 Cases would not be converted to Chapter 7 liquidation cases or that any new Plan would be as favorable as contemplated by the RSA.\nIn certain instances, a Chapter 11 case may be converted to a case under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.\nUpon a showing of cause, the Bankruptcy Court may convert the Chapter 11 Cases to a case under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. In such event, a Chapter 7 trustee would be appointed or elected to liquidate our assets for distribution in accordance with the priorities established by the Bankruptcy Code. We believe that liquidation under Chapter 7 would result in significantly smaller distributions being made to our creditors than those provided for in the Plan because of (i) the likelihood that the assets would have to be sold or otherwise disposed of in a distressed fashion over a short period of time rather than in a controlled manner and as a going concern, (ii) additional administrative expenses involved in the appointment of a Chapter 7 trustee, and (iii) additional expenses and claims, some of which would be entitled to priority, that would be generated during the liquidation and from the rejection of executory contracts in connection with a cessation of operations.\nWe may be subject to claims that will not be discharged in the Chapter 11 Cases, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Bankruptcy Court provides that the confirmation of a plan of reorganization discharges a debtor from substantially all debts arising prior to consummation of a plan of reorganization. With few exceptions, all claims that arose prior to March 16, 2020 or before consummation of the Plan (i) would be subject to compromise and/or treatment under the Plan and/or (ii) would be discharged in accordance\nwith the Bankruptcy Code and the terms of the Plan. Any claims not ultimately discharged pursuant to the Plan could be asserted against the reorganized entities and may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations on a post-reorganization basis.\nThe Chapter 11 Cases limit the flexibility of our management team in running our business.\nWhile we operate our business as debtor-in-possession under supervision by the Bankruptcy Court, we are required to obtain the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and, in some cases, the Consenting Lenders, prior to engaging in activities or transactions outside the ordinary course of business. Bankruptcy Court approval of non-ordinary course activities entails, among other things, preparation and filing of appropriate motions with the Bankruptcy Court and one or more hearings. It is possible that third parties may be heard at any Bankruptcy Court hearing and may raise objections with respect to these motions.\nThis process may delay major transactions and limit our ability to respond in a timely manner to adapt to changing market or industry conditions or to take advantage of certain opportunities. Furthermore, in the event the Bankruptcy Court does not approve a proposed activity or transaction, we would be prevented from engaging in activities and transactions that we believe to be beneficial to us.\nThe commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases has consumed and will continue to consume a substantial portion of the time and attention of our management and will impact how our business is conducted, which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe requirements of the Chapter 11 Cases have consumed and will continue to consume a substantial portion of our management\u2019s time and attention and leave them with less time to devote to the operation of our business. This diversion of attention may materially adversely affect the conduct of our business and, as a result, our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may experience employee attrition as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases.\nAs a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, we may experience employee attrition, and our employees may face considerable distraction and uncertainty, particularly in conjunction with remote working arrangements as a result of COVID-19. A loss of key personnel or material erosion of employee morale could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our ability to engage, motivate and retain key employees or take other measures intended to motivate and incentivize key employees to remain with us through the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases is limited by restrictions on implementation of incentive programs under the Bankruptcy Code. The loss of services of members of our senior management team could impair our ability to execute our strategy and implement operational initiatives, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Although we have entered into retention arrangements with certain of our senior executives, there is no assurance that such retention agreements will be sufficient to retain their services.\nAdverse publicity in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases or otherwise could negatively affect our businesses.\nAdverse publicity or news coverage relating to us, including, but not limited to, publicity or news coverage in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, may negatively impact our efforts to establish and promote name recognition and a positive image after emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases. Although we have engaged experienced professionals to assist in our communication strategies, there is no guarantee that such strategies will operate as we intend.\nThe Plan contemplates that we will be a privately held company after emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases, which would result in less disclosure about us and may negatively affect our ability to raise additional funds.\nUpon the Effective Date of the Plan, we anticipate being a privately held company due to no longer meeting the requirements for filing periodic or current reports under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. In connection with the Plan, we intend to file a Form 15 to voluntarily deregister our securities under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and suspend our reporting obligations under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act. Following deregistration, we do not expect to publish periodic financial information or furnish such information to our stockholders except as may be required by applicable laws. These actions will result in less disclosure about us and may negatively affect our ability to raise additional funds.\nThe filing of the Chapter 11 Cases could detrimentally affect the trading liquidity of our common stock.\nOn March 17, 2020, Nasdaq notified us of its determination to delist our common stock from Nasdaq under its applicable rules. We did not appeal this determination and our common stock was delisted on March 26, 2020. Our common stock is currently quoted on the OTC under the symbol \u201cINAPQ.\u201d However, we cannot assure you that the quotation or trading of our common stock on the OTC or any other alternative market will provide sufficient trading liquidity.\nSecurities quoted or traded on alternative markets such as the OTC generally have significantly less liquidity than securities traded on a national securities exchange due to factors such as the reduced number of (i) investors that will consider investing in the securities, (ii) market makers in the securities, and (iii) securities analysts that follow such securities. As a result, holders of shares of our common stock may find it difficult to resell their shares at prices quoted in the market or at all.\nFurthermore, because of the limited market and generally low volume of trading in our common stock that could occur, the share price of our common stock could be more likely to be affected by broad market fluctuations, general market conditions, fluctuations in our operating results, changes in the markets perception of our business, and announcements made by us, our competitors, parties with whom we have business relationships or third parties with interests in the Chapter 11 Cases.\nThe delisting of our common stock could impair our ability to incentivize key personnel through equity-based compensation or to use our equity for other strategic purposes. A number of institutional investors have investment policies that prohibit them from trading in securities listed on an over-the-counter market. Similarly, many brokers may be restricted from recommending over-the-counter securities to their customers due to their firm\u2019s trading policies or applicable regulations of self-regulatory agencies. As a result, investors may find it less convenient to sell, or to obtain accurate quotations in seeking to buy, our common stock on an over-the-counter market, which would significantly limit the liquidity of our common stock and may adversely affect the demand for and market price of our common stock.\nThe lack of liquidity in our common stock may also make it difficult for us to issue additional securities for financing or other purposes, or to otherwise arrange for any financing we may need in the future. For these and other reasons, we urge that extreme caution be exercised with respect to existing and future investments in our common stock.\nWe cannot predict the amount of time needed in Chapter 11 to implement the Plan, and lengthy Chapter 11 cases could disrupt its businesses, as well as impair prospects for reorganization on terms contained in the Plan and possibly provide an opportunity for other plans to be proposed\nWe cannot be certain that the Chapter 11 Cases, commenced solely for the purpose of implementing the Plan, would be of relatively short duration (e.g., 45 to 65 days) and would not unduly disrupt our businesses. It is impossible to predict with certainty the amount of time needed in bankruptcy, and we cannot be certain that the Plan will be confirmed. Moreover, the Bankruptcy Code limits the time during which a debtor has an exclusive right to file a plan before other proponents can propose and file their own plan.\nAny additional time we spend in the Chapter 11 process would also involve additional expenses and divert the attention of management from operation of the businesses, as well as create concerns for personnel, vendors, suppliers, service providers, and customers. The disruption that extended time in Chapter 11 cases would inflict upon our businesses would increase with the length of time needed to complete the Restructuring, and the severity of that disruption would depend upon the attractiveness and feasibility of the Plan from the perspective of the constituent parties, including suppliers, service providers, vendors, personnel, and customers. Significant delay may result in the termination of the RSA or the DIP Facility due to missed milestones, other termination events, or other applicable events of default.\nIf we are unable to obtain confirmation of the Plan on a timely basis for any reason, we may be forced to operate in Chapter 11 for an extended period while trying to develop a different Chapter 11 plan that can be confirmed. Protracted Chapter 11 cases would increase both the probability and the magnitude of the adverse effects described above.\nWe may be unable to obtain confirmation of the Plan\nAlthough we believe that the Plan will satisfy all requirements for confirmation under the Bankruptcy Code, there can be no assurance that the Bankruptcy Court will reach the same conclusion. Moreover, there can be no assurance that modifications to the Plan will not be required for confirmation or that such modifications would not be sufficiently material as to necessitate the re-solicitation of votes on the Plan.\nIf the Plan is not confirmed, there can be no assurance the Chapter 11 Cases will continue rather than be converted into Chapter 7 liquidation cases or that any alternative Chapter 11 plan or plans would be on terms as favorable to the holders of claims and interests as the terms of the Plan. If a liquidation or protracted reorganization of our bankruptcy estate were to occur, there is a substantial risk that our going concern value would be substantially eroded.\nThere is a risk that certain parties could oppose and object to either the entirety of the Plan or specific provisions of the Plan. Although we believe that the Plan complies with all relevant Bankruptcy Code provisions, there can be no guarantee that a party in interest will not file an objection to the Plan or that the Bankruptcy Court will not sustain such an objection.\nRisks Related to our Business\nWe cannot predict with certainty the future evolution of the IT infrastructure market in which we compete and may be unable to respond effectively or on a timely basis to rapid technological change.\nThe IT infrastructure market in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology and new industry standards and customer needs, as well as by frequent new product and service introductions. Innovative new IT technologies and evolving industry standards have the potential to quickly gain widespread acceptance, either replacing or providing efficient, potentially lower-cost alternatives to more traditional IT communications services. The adoption of such new technologies or industry standards could render our existing services obsolete and unmarketable or require us to spend significant amounts of capital to develop, adapt or adopt new technologies or industry standards.\nOur failure to anticipate new technology trends that may eventually become the preferred technology choice of our customers, to adapt our technology to any changes in the prevailing industry standards (or, conversely, for there to be an absence of generally accepted standards applicable to the industries we compete in) could materially and adversely affect our business. Our pursuit of and investment in necessary technological advances may require substantial time and expense, but may not guarantee that we can successfully adapt our network and services to alternative access devices and technologies. Technological advances in computer processing, hardware, storage, capacity, component size, artificial intelligence solutions, cloud computing solutions or power management could result in a decreased demand for our data center and hosting services. Likewise, if the Internet backbone becomes subject to a form of central management or gatekeeping control (whether by the government or another centralized entity), or if internet service providers (\"ISPs\") establish an economic settlement arrangement regarding the exchange of traffic between Internet networks that is passed on to Internet users, the demand for our services could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to develop new and enhanced services and products that achieve widespread market acceptance, or if we are unable to improve the performance and features of our existing services and products or adapt our business model to keep pace with industry trends, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe markets in which we compete are constantly evolving. The process of expending research and development funds to create new services and products, and the technologies that support them, is expensive, time and labor intensive and uncertain. We may not understand or accurately assess the market demand for new services and products, price the new services and products on a competitive basis, or not be able to fix technical problems with new services and products. The demand for top research and development and technical talent is high, and there is significant competition for these scarce resources.\nOur future success may depend on our ability to respond to the rapidly changing needs of our customers by expending research and development funds in an efficient manner to acquire talent and to develop, introduce and market new services, products and upgrades on a timely basis. New product development, introduction and marketing involves a significant commitment of time and resources and is subject to a number of risks and challenges, including:\n\u2022\ndeveloping or expanding efficient sales channels;\n\u2022\nsourcing, identifying, obtaining and managing qualified research and development and technical staff with the appropriate skill and expertise;\n\u2022\nmanaging the length and roll out of the development cycle for new products and product enhancements;\n\u2022\nidentifying and adapting to emerging and evolving industry standards and to technological developments by our competitors\u2019 and customers\u2019 services and products;\n\u2022\nentering into new or unproven markets where we have limited experience or there is significant competition;\n\u2022\ndeveloping and managing new service and product service strategies and integrating them with our existing services and products;\n\u2022\nincorporating acquired products, technologies and personnel;\n\u2022\ntrade compliance issues affecting our ability to ship new products to international markets; and\n\u2022\nobtaining required technology licenses and technical access from operating system software vendors on reasonable terms to enable the development and deployment of interoperable products.\nIn addition, if we cannot innovate or improve our current products or adapt our business models to keep pace with industry trends, our revenue could be negatively impacted. If we are not successful in managing these risks and challenges, or if our new services, products\nand upgrades are not technologically competitive or do not achieve market acceptance, we may experience a material decrease in our revenues and earnings.\nFailure to retain existing customers or attract new customers could cause our revenue to decline.\nIn addition to adding new customers, we must sell additional services to existing customers and encourage them to increase their usage levels to increase our revenue. If our existing and prospective customers do not perceive our services to be of sufficiently high value and quality, do not think that we can deliver on providing or do not provide the proper technological solutions or industry standard services, or the perception that our financial and operation condition is not sound, we may not be able to retain our current customers or attract new ones. Our customers have no obligation to renew their agreements for our services after the expiration of their initial commitment, and these agreements may not be renewed at the same price or level of service, if at all. Due to the upfront costs of implementing IT infrastructure services, if our customers do not renew or cancel their agreements, we may not be able to recover the initial costs associated with bringing additional IT infrastructure on-line.\nOur customers\u2019 renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\ntheir level of satisfaction with our services;\n\u2022\nour ability to provide features and functionality demanded by our customers;\n\u2022\nthe prices of our services compared to our competitors;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances that allow customers to meet their needs with fewer infrastructure resources;\n\u2022\nperceptions regarding us, our prospects and our financial and operating results, including as a result of filing the Chapter 11 Cases;\n\u2022\nmergers and acquisitions affecting our customer base; which include a significant number of technology customers that are potentially attractive acquisition targets; and\n\u2022\nreduction in our customers\u2019 spending levels or economic decline in our customer\u2019s markets.\nIf our customers do not renew their agreements with us or if they renew on less favorable terms than their existing agreements, our revenue would decline, and our results of operations may suffer. Similarly, our customer agreements may provide for minimum commitments that may be significantly below our customers\u2019 historical usage levels. Consequently, these customers could significantly curtail their usage without incurring any incremental fees under our agreements. In this event, our revenue would be lower than expected and our operating results could suffer.\nOur capital investment strategy for data center, cloud and IT infrastructure services expansion may contain erroneous assumptions causing our return on invested capital to be materially lower than expected and could materially impact our results of operations.\nOur strategic decision to invest capital in expanding our data center, cloud and IT infrastructure services is based on, among other things, significant assumptions related to expected growth of these markets, our IT solutions program, our competitors\u2019 perceived or actual plans and current and expected server utilization and data center occupancy rates. Adding data center space involves capital outlays well ahead of planned usage. Although we believe we can accurately project future space needs in particular markets, these plans require significant estimates and assumptions based on available market data. We have no way of ensuring the data or models we use to deploy capital into existing markets, or to create new markets, has been or will be accurate, particularly as technology and industry standards evolve. In addition, our investments may be impacted by the restrictions contained in our DIP Facility and as a result of filing the Chapter 11 Cases. Errors or imprecision in these estimates, especially those related to our cost of capital, customer demand or our competitors\u2019 plans, could cause actual results to differ materially from our expected results and could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may experience difficulties in executing our capital investment strategy to expand our IT infrastructure services, upgrade existing facilities or establish new facilities, products, services or capabilities.\nAs part of our strategy, we may continue to expand our IT infrastructure services and may encounter challenges and difficulties in implementing our expansion plans. This could cause us to grow at a slower rate than projected in our capital investment modeling strategy. These challenges and difficulties relate to our ability to:\n\u2022\nidentify and obtain the use of locations meeting our selection criteria on competitive terms, if at all;\n\u2022\nestimate costs and control delays for our services;\n\u2022\nobtain necessary permits on a timely basis, if at all;\n\u2022\ngenerate sufficient cash flow from operations or through current or additional debt or equity financings to support these expansion plans, particularly while we are in Chapter 11 bankruptcy and subject to the restrictions contained in our DIP Facility;\n\u2022\nestablish or retain key relationships with IT infrastructure providers and other third party vendors required to deliver our services;\n\u2022\nobtain the necessary power density, upgrades and supply from local utility companies at competitive rates;\n\u2022\nhire, train, retain and manage sufficient operational and technical employees and supporting personnel;\n\u2022\navoid labor issues impacting our suppliers, such as a strike; and\n\u2022\nidentify and obtain contractors that perform on the agreed upon contract performance.\nIf we encounter greater than anticipated difficulties in implementing our expansion plans, are unable to deploy new IT infrastructure services or do not adequately control expenses associated with the deployment of new IT infrastructure services, it may be necessary to take additional remedial actions, which could divert management\u2019s attention and strain our operational and financial resources. We may not successfully address any or all of these challenges, and our failure to do so would adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business could be harmed by prolonged power outages or shortages, increased costs of energy or general lack of availability of electrical resources.\nOur data centers are susceptible to regional costs of power, power shortages, planned or unplanned power outages and limitations on the availability of adequate power resources.\nPower outages, including, but not limited to those relating to large storms, hurricanes, terrorism, earthquakes, fires or other natural disasters or due to the breakout of disease or pandemics, could harm our customers and our business. We attempt to limit our exposure to system downtime by using backup generators and alternative power supplies; however, we may not be able to limit our exposure entirely even with these protections in place. Some of our data centers are located in leased buildings where, depending upon the lease requirements and number of tenants involved, we may or may not control some or all of the infrastructure necessary for power generation in adverse conditions, including generators and fuel tanks. As a result, in the event of a power outage, we may be dependent upon the landlord, as well as the utility company, to restore the power.\nIn addition, global fluctuations in the price of power can increase the cost of energy. In each of our markets, we rely on third parties to provide a sufficient amount of power for current and future customers. At the same time, the demand for power and cooling is growing. This means that we could face power limitations in our data centers if we are unable to obtain additional power from our service providers. This could have a negative impact on the effective available capacity of a given data center and limit our ability to grow our business, which could have a negative impact on our financial performance, operating results and cash flows. We may also have difficulty obtaining sufficient power capacity for potential sites in new or existing markets. We may experience significant delays and substantial increased costs demanded by the utilities to provide the level of electrical service required by our current data center designs.\nPricing pressure may continue to decrease our revenue for certain services.\nPricing for Internet connectivity, data transit and data storage services has declined in recent years and may continue to decline, which would continue to impact our business. By bundling their services and reducing the overall cost of their service offerings, certain of our competitors may be able to provide customers with reduced costs for their Internet connectivity, data transit and data storage services or private network services, thereby significantly increasing the pressure on us to decrease our prices, whether unbundled or bundled. Increased price competition, price deflation and other related competitive pressures have eroded, and could continue to erode, our revenue and margins and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations if we are unable to control or reduce our costs. Because we rely on ISPs to deliver our services and have agreed with some of these providers to purchase minimum amounts of service at predetermined prices, our profitability could be adversely affected by competitive price reductions offered to our customers even if accompanied with an increased number of customers.\nMany of our competitors for cloud services have substantially greater financial resources and may also adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote greater resources to the promotion, marketing and sales of their services. Other competitors may be financed in a manner which can allow them to experience losses for long periods of time in order to gain market share. Such competitive actions could cause us to lower prices for certain products or services to remain competitive in the market. In addition, we have seen and may continue to see increased competition for colocation services from wholesale data center providers, such as services from large real estate companies. Rather than leasing available space to large single tenants, wholesale data center providers may decide to convert the space instead to smaller units designed for retail colocation use. As a result of such competition, we could suffer from downward pricing pressure and the loss of customers, which would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe market in which we operate is highly competitive and has experienced recent consolidation which may continue, and we may lack the financial and other resources, expertise, scale or capability necessary to capture increased market share or maintain our market share.\nWe compete in a rapidly evolving, highly competitive market which has been, and is likely to continue to be, characterized by overcapacity, industry consolidation and continued pricing pressure. In addition, our competitors may acquire software-application vendors, technology providers or other service providers, or develop similar products enabling them to more effectively compete with us. We believe that participants in this market must grow rapidly and achieve a significant presence to compete effectively, particularly as fixed costs increase for industry participants. This consolidation could affect prices and other competitive factors in ways that would impede our ability to compete successfully in the IT infrastructure market. As a result of this consolidation, many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and market resources, greater name recognition and more established relationships in the industry and may be able to:\n\u2022\ndevelop and expand their IT infrastructure and service offerings more rapidly;\n\u2022\nadapt to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements more quickly;\n\u2022\ntake advantage of acquisitions and other opportunities more readily;\n\u2022\nborrow at more competitive rates or otherwise take advantage of capital resources not available to us;\n\u2022\nattract or retain more qualified personnel to develop and market their service offerings; or\n\u2022\ndevote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their services and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can.\nIn addition, IT infrastructure providers may make technological advancements to enhance the quality of their services, which could negatively impact the demand for our IT infrastructure services. We also expect that we will face additional competition as we expand our product offerings, including competition from technology and telecommunications companies and non-technology companies which are entering the market through leveraging their existing or expanded network services and cloud infrastructure platforms. Further, the ability of some of these potential competitors to bundle other services and products with their network services could place us at a competitive disadvantage. Various companies also are exploring the possibility of providing, or are currently providing, high-speed, intelligent data services that use connections to more than one network or use alternative delivery methods, including the cable television infrastructure, direct broadcast satellites and wireless local loops.\nWe may lack financial and other resources, expertise or capability necessary to maintain or capture increased market share. Increased competition and technological advancements by our competitors could materially and adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have a long sales cycle for our IT infrastructure services and the implementation efforts required by customers to activate them can be substantial.\nMany of our IT infrastructure services are complex and require substantial sales efforts and technical consultation to implement. A customer\u2019s decision to outsource some or all of its IT infrastructure typically involves a significant commitment of resources. Some customers may be reluctant to purchase our services due to their inability to accurately forecast future demand, delay in their internal decision-making, uncertainty over economic conditions or our ability to provide those services, particularly while we are in Chapter 11 bankruptcy, or inability to obtain necessary internal approvals to commit resources. We may expend time and resources pursuing a particular sale or customer that does not result in revenue or the revenue is less than we originally forecast when we pursued the customer. Delays due to the length of our sales cycle may harm our ability to meet our forecasts and materially and adversely affect our revenues and operating results.\nWe may fail to obtain or lose customers if they elect to develop or maintain some or all of their IT infrastructure services internally.\nOur current and potential customers may decide to develop or maintain their own IT infrastructure rather than outsource to service providers like us. These in-house IT infrastructure services could be perceived to be superior, more secure or more cost effective compared to our services. If we fail to offer IT infrastructure services that compete favorably with in-sourced services or if we fail to differentiate or effectively market our IT infrastructure services, we may lose customers or fail to attract customers that may consider pursuing this in-sourced approach, and our business, consolidated financial condition and results of operations would suffer as a result.\nIn addition, our customers\u2019 business models may change in ways that we do not anticipate, and these changes could reduce or eliminate our customers\u2019 needs for our services. If this occurs, we could lose customers or potential customers, and our business and financial results would suffer. As a result of these or similar potential developments in the future, it is possible that competitive dynamics in our market may require us to reduce our prices, which could harm our revenue, gross margin and operating results.\nFinally, potential customers may be consolidated into larger companies that do not require our services because the larger company has IT solutions currently in place. If potential customers continue to consolidate, it may require us to seek an increasingly small number of potential customers, which could impact our margins and harm our revenue, gross margin and operating results.\nOur network and software are subject to potential security breaches and similar threats that could result in liability and harm our reputation.\nThreats to IT security can take a variety of forms. Individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including state-sponsored organizations or nation-states, continuously undertake attacks that pose threats to our customers and our IT. These actors may use a wide variety of methods, which may include developing and deploying malicious software to attack our products and services and gain access to our networks and data centers, using social engineering techniques to induce our employees, users, partners, or customers to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or take other actions to gain access to our data or our users\u2019 or customers\u2019 data, or acting in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service, ransomware or other coordinated attacks. Cyber threats are constantly evolving, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. Cyber threats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our customers.\nA number of widespread and disabling attacks on public and private networks have occurred in the past in our industry. The number and severity of these attacks may increase in the future as network assailants take advantage of outdated software, hardware limitations, software vulnerabilities, inexperienced personnel, security breaches or incompatibility between or among networks. Computer viruses, intrusions and similar disruptive problems could cause us to be liable for damages under agreements with our customers and fines and penalties to governmental or regulatory agencies, and our reputation could suffer, thereby resulting in a loss of current customers and deterring potential customers from working with us. Security problems or other attacks caused by third parties could lead to interruptions and delays or to the cessation of service to our customers. Furthermore, inappropriate use of the network by third parties could also jeopardize the security of confidential information stored in our computer systems and in those of our customers and could expose us to liability under unsolicited commercial e-mail, or 'spam', regulations. Even the perception that our networks are lacking proper data security protocols could impact our business and result in the loss of customers.\nIn the past, third parties have occasionally circumvented some of these industry-standard measures. We can offer no assurance that the measures we implement will not be circumvented. Breaches of our network or data security could disrupt the security of our internal systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data, result in product development delays, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, require us to allocate more resources to improved technologies, divert management\u2019s attention, or otherwise adversely affect our business. Affected customers might file claims against us under such circumstances or governmental entities may fine or otherwise sanction us, and our insurance may not be available or adequate to cover these claims.\nDisclosure of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation.\nAs we continue to grow our cloud services, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable information of our customers. The continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security and illustrates the value of certain types of personally identifiable information. Despite our efforts to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies, it is possible that the security controls we have implemented to safeguard personal data and our networks, our training of employees and vendors on data security, our vendor security requirements, and other practices we follow may not prevent or detect the compromise of our networks or the improper disclosure of customer data that we or our vendors store and manage. Improper disclosure could harm our reputation, create risks for customers, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue.\nIf governments modify or increase regulation of the Internet, or goods or services necessary to operate the Internet or our IT infrastructure, our services could become more costly.\nInternational bodies and federal, state and local governments have adopted a number of laws and regulations that affect the Internet and are likely to continue to seek to implement additional laws and regulations. In addition, federal and state agencies have adopted or are actively considering regulation of various aspects of the Internet and/or IP services, including taxation of transactions, enhanced data privacy and data retention legislation and various energy regulations, as well as law enforcement surveillance and anti-terrorism initiatives targeting instant messaging applications. For example, if the Federal Communications Commission (the \"FCC\" or \"Commission\") were to impose federal Universal Service Fund requirements on a number of our managed hosting services such as virtual private network, dedicated IP and other enterprise customer services, that could raise our costs, and potentially require us to charge more for our services than we currently do and negatively impact our business. Additionally, we must comply with federal and state consumer protection\nlaws. Finally, other potential laws and regulations targeted at goods or services that are cost inputs necessary to operate our managed service and colocation offerings could have a negative impact on us. These factors may impact the delivery of our services by driving up the cost of power, which is a significant cost of operating our data centers and other service points.\nOngoing changes to the so-called \"open Internet\" or \"net neutrality\" rules could also affect our business. At the end of 2017, the FCC adopted a new Open Internet order that largely repealed the Open Internet rules the Commission had approved in 2015. The 2015 rules reclassified broadband Internet access as a \"telecommunications service,\" which subjected it to broad, \"common carrier\" regulation originally devised for telephone service. The 2015 order also established (among other things) \"bright line rules\" that prohibited an ISP from blocking, throttling (impairing or degrading lawful Internet traffic on the basis of content, applications or service), and paid prioritization or \"fast lanes,\" including for ISP affiliates. It also included transparency requirements.\nThe 2017 order reclassified broadband Internet access back to be an \"information service,\" eliminating the common carrier regulation (including blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization) and the FCC\u2019s jurisdiction for imposing that type of regulation. Instead, broadband providers are subject only to a transparency requirement. On appeal, the D.C. Circuit upheld most of the 2017 order, but overturned the FCC\u2019s decision to broadly prohibit state regulation of broadband Internet service, explaining that the FCC\u2019s authority is limited to deciding on a case-by-case basis whether state laws actually conflict with the order. A petition for reconsideration is pending. If the request for reconsideration is successful, or the U.S. Supreme Court decides to take the case and reverses, some or all of the 2015 restrictions could become applicable once again. Proposals to impose Open Internet-style regulations are also pending in other governmental bodies, including the U.S. Congress and some states (which would face preemption challenges but on a narrower basis given the D.C. Circuit\u2019s ruling). In light of these changes, challenges, and proposals, it is unclear what Open Internet regulations may exist in the future.\nWhile we are not an ISP or a broadband Internet access provider, many of our customers have Internet businesses and rely on us for Web hosting, colocation of Web servers and routers and cloud services. If certain broadband access providers were to unreasonably interfere or disadvantage certain of our Internet edge provider customers by not allowing consumers to access them under comparable rates and service terms, then that could harm our business.\nIn another pending rulemaking, the FCC is proposing to regulate Internet-based video programming providers as multi-channel video programming distributors (\"MVPDs\") as it currently regulates established cable television providers and satellite providers. Approximately three years ago, during the previous administration, the FCC tentatively concluded that the traditional definition of MVPD requiring ownership of the video transmission path should be expanded to include Internet-based video programmers. Though it is unclear if the FCC will ever issue the proposed rules, if it does so, this proceeding could directly impact the ability of a number of our customers to compete for video programming, and thereby impact the future use of our services.\nIn addition, laws relating to the liability of private network operators and information carried on or disseminated through their networks are unsettled, both in the U.S. and abroad. The nature of any new laws and regulations and the interpretation of applicability to the Internet of existing laws governing intellectual property ownership and infringement, copyright, trademark, trade secret, national security, law enforcement, obscenity, libel, employment, personal privacy, consumer protection and other issues are uncertain and developing. We may become subject to legal claims such as defamation, invasion of privacy or copyright infringement in connection with content stored on or distributed through our network. We cannot predict the impact, if any, that future regulation or regulatory changes may have on our business.\nIf we fail to comply with privacy rules and regulations implemented by local or foreign governments and agencies, our business could be adversely affected, and we could face claims for liabilities.\nOn January 1, 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\"CCPA\") went into effect. Regulatory enforcement of the CCPA begins July 1, 2020. The CCPA imposes requirements on for-profit companies that conduct business in California, that collect or use personal information of California residents and that have gross revenues of over $25.0 million. The CCPA applies to companies that meet this description regardless of whether the company has physical operations in California. We have adopted internal and external policies, procedures and contracts governing our collection of data to the extent effected by and subject to the statutory provisions of the CCPA. The Attorney General for the State of California has not released final regulations implementing CCPA. Additionally, there exists the possibility that CCPA will be significantly amended by the California legislature or through a 2020 ballot initiative. We continue to monitor for the publication of the final regulations and are tracking the potential for amendments to the CCPA.\nOur actual or alleged failure to comply with the CCPA could result in enforcement actions, and significant penalties against us. Our actual or alleged failure to protect personal data under the CCPA could result in a private right of action being brought against us. Both of these risks could result in negative publicity, increase our operating costs, subject us to claims or other remedies and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\")\nprohibits companies from transferring European Economic Area (\"EEA\") residents\u2019 personal data from the EEA to a non-EEA country, unless the European Commission has deemed the laws of that country to provide 'adequate' protection for personal data or appropriate safeguards are in place or one of the specific derogations set forth in GDPR applies. Other than data transfers covered by the EU-U.S. Privacy shield (\"Privacy Shield\") framework, the European Commission has concluded that U.S. data privacy law is does not meet EU adequacy requirements. The European Commission does not consider U.S. data privacy laws to be adequate for outside transfers covered by the Privacy Shield framework. INAP and certain of its subsidiaries are certified to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield, which provide a legal framework for the transfer of personal data of EU and Swiss data subjects to the U.S. under EU and Swiss law. Privacy Shield, among other things, requires companies in the U.S. that receive personal data from the EU and Switzerland to adhere to certain privacy principles. Companies that certify to Privacy Shield, but fail to abide by its requirements, could be subject to enforcement actions by EU and Swiss data protection authorities or the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.\nOn October 23, 2019, the European Commission published a report in which it confirmed that Privacy Shield continues to ensure an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred from the EU to the U.S. The European Commission did, however, recommend that further steps should be taken to better ensure the effective functioning of the Privacy Shield in practice. Following the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the EU on January 31, 2020, in order for Privacy Shield certified companies to transfer the personal data from the UK to the U.S., companies will need to comply with certain, additional requirements. Companies that are not certified under Privacy Shield may rely on other lawful data transfer mechanisms, such as standard contractual clauses or (for intra-company cross-border data transfers) binding corporate rules. Companies that transfer personal data from the EEA to the U.S. without an appropriate data transfer mechanism in place or in a circumstance where one of the GDPR\u2019s specific derogations do not apply could be subject to enforcement actions by EU member state data protection authorities.\nIn addition to laws regulating the cross-border transfer of personal data, the GDPR, which went into effect on May 25, 2018, imposes requirements on all companies that offer goods and services to, or monitor the behavior of, data subjects in the EU. The GDPR applies to companies that meet this description regardless of whether such companies have physical operations in the EU. In light of these developments, we adopted internal and external policies, procedures, and contracts governing our processing of data that is subject to the GDPR, including the cross-border transfer of such data from the EEA to the U.S. We continue to monitor the regulation and enforcement of data privacy regulations as these regulations continue to evolve.\nOur actual or alleged failure to comply with applicable EU laws and regulations, or to protect personal data, could result in enforcement actions and significant penalties against us, which could result in negative publicity, increase our operating costs, subject us to claims or other remedies and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may be liable for the material that content providers distribute over our network, and we may have to terminate customers that provide content that is determined to be illegal, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nThe law relating to the liability of private network operators for information carried on, stored on, or disseminated through their networks is still unsettled in many jurisdictions. We have been and expect to continue to be subject to legal claims relating to the content disseminated on our network, including allegations of defamation, invasion of privacy, copyright infringement or other similar claims under Digital Millennium Copyright Act, other legislation and common law. In addition, there are other potential customer activities, such as online gambling (if illegal in such state) and pornography, where we, in our role as a hosting provider, may be held liable as an aider or abettor of our customers. If we need to take costly measures to reduce our exposure to these risks, terminate customer relationships and the associated revenue or defend ourselves against such claims, our financial results could be negatively affected.\nIf we fail to comply with telecommunications services regulations our business could be negatively affected.\nWe must comply with various regulatory requirements to provide certain network services, such as the filing of tariffs, annual reports and universal service reports with governmental authorities. We also must comply with state consumer protection laws in every state in which we operate, which are subject to frequent changes and occasional uncertainty as to their application to us. Failure to comply with any of these requirements could negatively impact our business.\nWe depend on third party suppliers for key elements of our IT infrastructure services and products. If we are unable to obtain these elements on a cost- effective basis, or at all, or if such services are interrupted, limited or terminated, our growth prospects and business operations may be adversely affected.\nIn delivering our services, we rely on a number of Internet networks, many of which are built and operated by third parties. To provide high performance connectivity services through our network access points, we purchase connections from several ISPs. We can offer no assurances that these ISPs will continue to provide service to us on a continuous, cost-effective basis or on competitive terms, if at all, or that these providers will provide us with additional capacity to adequately meet customer demand or to expand our business.\nConsolidation among ISPs limits the number of vendors from which we obtain service, possibly resulting in higher network costs to us. We may be unable to establish and maintain relationships with other ISPs that may emerge or that are significant in geographic areas, such as Asia and Europe, in which we may locate our future network access points. Any of these situations could limit our growth prospects and materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe also depend on other companies to supply various key elements of our network infrastructure, including the network access loops between our network access points and our ISP, local loops between our network access points and our customers\u2019 networks and certain end-user access networks. Pricing for such network access loops and local loops has risen over time and operators of these networks may take measures that could degrade, disrupt or increase the cost of our or our customers\u2019 access to certain of these end-user access networks by restricting or prohibiting the use of their networks to support or facilitate our services, or by charging increased fees. Some of our competitors have their own network access loops and local loops and are, therefore, not subject to similar availability and pricing issues. The inability to access or obtain network loops such as these on a cost-effective basis could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations.\nFor data center and hosting facilities, we rely on a number of landlords or vendors to provide physical space, convert or build space to our specifications, provide power, internal cabling and wiring, climate control, physical security and system redundancy. We typically obtain physical space through long-term leases. We utilize multiple other vendors to perform leasehold improvements necessary to make the physical space available for occupancy. The demand for premium data center and hosting space in several key markets has outpaced supply over recent years and the imbalance is projected to continue over the near term. This has limited our physical space options and increased, and will continue to increase, our costs to add capacity. If we are not able to procure space through renewing our existing leases or entering into new leases, acquiring the entities which have leases, or are not able to contain costs for physical space, or are not able to pass these costs on to our customers, our results will be adversely affected.\nIn addition, we currently purchase infrastructure equipment such as servers, routers, switches and storage components from a limited number of vendors. We do not carry significant inventories of the equipment we purchase, and we have no guaranteed supply arrangements with our vendors. A loss of a significant vendor, a vendor's bankruptcy or a vendor\u2019s refusal to sell us equipment could delay any build-out of our infrastructure and increase our costs or even cause us to fail to provide services to any of our customers on a timely basis. If our limited source of suppliers fails to provide products or services that comply with evolving Internet standards or that interoperate with other products or services we use in our network infrastructure, we may be unable to meet all or a portion of our customer service commitments, which could materially and adversely affect our results.\nSome of our products and services contain or use open source software, which may pose risks to our proprietary software and solutions.\nWe currently use open source software in our products and for certain services and will use open source software in the future. From time to time, we may face claims from third parties claiming ownership of, or demanding release of, the open source software or derivative works that we developed using such software (which could include our proprietary source code), or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. These claims could result in litigation and could require us to purchase a costly license or cease offering the implicated solutions unless and until we can re-engineer them to avoid infringement. This re-engineering process could require significant additional research and development resources and we may not be able to offer an effective solution after the conclusion of such a process. In addition to risks related to license requirements, use of certain open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third party commercial software because open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of the software or the use of such software may expose us to a cybersecurity incident. Any of these risks could be difficult to eliminate or manage, and, if not addressed, could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nAny failure of our physical IT infrastructure or applications could lead to unexpected costs and disruptions that could harm our business reputation, consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business depends on providing customers with highly-reliable services. We must protect our IT infrastructure and our customers\u2019 data and their equipment located in our data centers. The services we provide in each of our data centers are subject to failure resulting from numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nhuman error or accidents;\n\u2022\nphysical or electronic security breaches;\n\u2022\nnetwork connectivity downtime;\n\u2022\nfire, earthquake, hurricane, flood, tornado and other natural disasters;\n\u2022\nimproper maintenance by the landlords of the buildings in which our data centers are located;\n\u2022\nwater damage, extreme temperatures and fiber cuts;\n\u2022\npower loss, utility interruptions or equipment failure;\n\u2022\nsabotage, vandalism and terrorism, pandemics; and\n\u2022\nfailure by us or our vendors to provide adequate service or maintenance to our equipment.\nAdditionally, in connection with the expansion or consolidation of our existing data center facilities from time to time, there is an increased risk that service interruptions may occur as a result of server relocation or other unforeseen construction-related issues or issues with moving and bringing equipment online.\nProblems at one of our sites, whether or not within our control, could result in service interruptions or significant equipment damage. Most of our customers have service level agreements (\"SLA\") that require us to meet minimum performance obligations and to provide service credits to customers if we do not meet those obligations. If a service interruption impacts a significant portion of our customer base, the amount of service credits we are required to provide could adversely impact our business and financial condition. Also, if we experience a service interruption and we fail to provide a service credit under an SLA, we could face claims related to such failures, which could adversely impact our business and financial condition. Because our data centers are mission critical to our customers\u2019 businesses, service interruptions or significant equipment damage in our data centers also could result in lost profits or other indirect or consequential damages to our customers. We cannot guarantee that a court would enforce any contractual limitations on our liability in the event that a customer brings a lawsuit against us as the result of a failure to meet performance obligations in our SLAs.\nAny loss of services, equipment damage or inability to meet performance obligations in our SLAs could reduce the confidence of our customers and could result in lost customers or an inability to attract new customers, which would adversely affect both our ability to generate revenues and our operating results.\nFurthermore, we are dependent upon ISPs and telecommunications carriers in the U.S., Europe and Asia-Pacific region, some of whom have experienced significant system failures and electrical outages in the past. Users of our services may experience difficulties due to system failures unrelated to our systems and services. If, for any reason, these providers fail to provide the required services, our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted.\nOur inability to renew our data center leases, or renew on favorable terms, and potential unknown costs related to asset retirement obligations could negatively impact our financial results.\nWe do not own the facilities occupied by our current data centers, but occupy them pursuant to commercial leasing arrangements. Generally, our leases provide us with the opportunity to renew the leases at our option for periods typically ranging from five to ten years. Many of these options provide that rent for the renewal period will be the fair market rental rate at the time of renewal. If the fair market rental rates are higher than our current rental rates, we may be unable to offset these costs by charging more for our services, which could have a negative impact on our financial results. In addition, we have long-term agreements for certain of the leased properties which extend beyond ten years and such agreements specify the rental rates for such long-term periods. If rental rates drop in the near term, we would not be able to take advantage of the drop in market rates until the expiration of the then-existing lease.\nFor the leases that do not contain renewal options, or for which the option to renew has been exhausted or passed, we cannot guarantee the landlord will renew the lease, or will do so at a rate that will allow us to maintain profitability on that particular space. While we proactively monitor these leases and conduct ongoing negotiations with landlords, our ability to renegotiate renewals is inherently limited by the original contract language, including option renewal clauses. If we are unable to renew, we may incur substantial costs to move our infrastructure and/or customers and to restore the property to its required condition. There is no guarantee that our customers would move with us and we may not be able to find appropriate and sufficient space. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, we have capital lease agreements that require us to decommission the physical space for which we have not yet recorded an asset retirement obligation (\"ARO\"). Due to the uncertainty of specific decommissioning obligations, timing and related costs, an ARO is not reasonably estimable for these properties and we have not recorded a liability at this time for such properties.\nA failure in the redundancies in one or more of our NOCs, POPs or computer systems could cause a significant disruption in Internet connectivity which could impact our ability to serve our customers.\nWhile we maintain multiple layers of redundancy in our operating facilities, if we experience a problem at one or more of our network operations centers (\"NOCs\"), including the failure of redundant systems, we may be unable to provide Internet connectivity services to our customers, provide customer service and support or monitor our network infrastructure or POPs, any of which would seriously harm our reputation, business and operating results. Also, because we are obligated to provide continuous Internet availability under our SLAs, we may be required to issue service credits as a result of such interruptions in service. If material, these credits could negatively\naffect our revenues and results of operations. In addition, interruptions in service to our customers could potentially harm our customer relations, expose us to potential lawsuits or necessitate additional capital expenditures.\nA significant number of our POPs are located in facilities owned and operated by third parties. In many of those arrangements, we do not have property rights similar to those customarily possessed by a lessee or subtenant but instead have lesser rights of occupancy. In certain situations, the financial condition of those parties providing occupancy to us could have an adverse impact on the continued occupancy arrangement or the level of service delivered to us under such arrangements.\nOur business requires the continued development of effective and efficient business support systems to support our customer growth and related services.\nThe growth of our business depends on our ability to continue to develop and successfully implement effective and efficient business support policies, processes and internal systems. This is a complicated undertaking requiring significant resources and expertise. Business support systems are needed for:\n\u2022\nsourcing, evaluating and targeting potential customers and managing existing customers;\n\u2022\nimplementing customer orders for services;\n\u2022\ndelivering these services;\n\u2022\ntimely billing and collection for these services;\n\u2022\nbudgeting, forecasting, tracking and reporting our results of operations;\n\u2022\nmaintaining the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting and\n\u2022\nproviding technical and operational support to customers and tracking the resolution of customer issues.\nIf the number of customers that we serve or our services portfolio increases, we may need to develop additional business support systems on a schedule sufficient to meet proposed service rollout dates. The failure to continue to develop effective and efficient business support systems, and update or optimize these systems to a level commensurate with the needs of our business and/or our competition, could harm our ability to implement our business plans, maintain competitiveness and meet our financial goals and objectives.\nWe are required to maintain, repair, upgrade, and replace our network and our facilities, the cost of which could materially impact our results and our failure to do so could irreparably harm our business.\nOur business requires that we maintain, repair, upgrade, and periodically replace our facilities and networks. This requires management time, and attention as well as planning by our staff and potentially significant capital expenditures. In the event that we fail to maintain, repair, upgrade, or replace essential portions of our network or facilities, it could lead to a material degradation or interruption in the level of service that we provide to our customers. Our networks can be damaged in a number of ways, including by other parties engaged in construction close to our network facilities. In the event of such damage, we will be required to incur expenses to repair the network. We could be subject to significant network repair and replacement expenses in the event a terrorist attack or a natural disaster damages our network. Further, the operation of our network requires the coordination and integration of sophisticated and highly specialized hardware and software. Our failure to maintain or properly operate this could lead to degradations or interruptions in customer service. Our failure to provide proper customer service could result in claims from our customers due to failing to meet SLAs, early termination of contracts, and damage to our reputation.\nOur global operations may not be successful.\nWe operate globally in various locations. We may develop or acquire POPs or complementary businesses in additional global markets. The risks associated with our global business operations include:\n\u2022\nchallenges in establishing and maintaining relationships with global customers, ISPs and local vendors, including data center and local network operators;\n\u2022\nchallenges in staffing and managing NOCs and POPs across disparate geographic areas;\n\u2022\npotential loss of proprietary information due to misappropriation or laws that may be less protective of our intellectual property rights than the laws in the U.S.;\n\u2022\nchallenges in reducing operating expense or other costs required by local laws and longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u2022\nexposure to fluctuations in international currency exchange rates; and\n\u2022\ncosts of customizing POPs for foreign countries and customers.\nWe may be unsuccessful in our efforts to address the risks associated with our global operations, which may limit our sales growth and materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe bankruptcy, insolvency or financial difficulties of a major customer could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe bankruptcy or insolvency of a major customer could have significant consequences for us. If any customer becomes a debtor in a case under the federal Bankruptcy Code, we cannot evict the customer solely because of the bankruptcy. In addition, the bankruptcy court might authorize the customer to reject and terminate its lease with us or otherwise attempt to recover amounts the customer paid to us. Our claim against the customer for unpaid future rent would be subject to a statutory cap that might be substantially less than the remaining rent owed under the lease. In either case, our claim for unpaid rent would likely not be paid in full. If any of our significant customers were to become bankrupt or insolvent or suffer a downturn in their business, they may fail to renew, or reject or terminate, their leases with us and/or fail to pay unpaid or future rent owed to us, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are dependent on certain key personnel, the loss of which may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe depend, and will continue to depend in the foreseeable future, on the services our Chief Executive Officer, Peter Aquino, and other key personnel, which may consist of a relatively small number of individuals that possess sales, research and development, engineering, marketing, financial, legal, technical and other skills that are critical to the operation of our business. The ability to retain officers and key senior employees is important to our success and future growth. Competition for these professionals can be intense, and we may not be able to retain and motivate our existing management and key personnel, and continue to compensate such individuals competitively, particularly in Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our businesses, and could hinder our ability to effectively compete in the various industries in which we operate.\nBecause we face significant competition for acquisition and business opportunities from numerous companies with a business plan similar to ours, it may be difficult for us to fully execute our business strategy.\nWe have encountered and expect to encounter intense competition for acquisitions and business opportunities from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including entities competing for the type of businesses that we may seek to acquire. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources, more local industry knowledge, or greater access to capital, than we do, and our financial and operational resources may be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. These factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully identifying and completing future acquisitions and business opportunities.\nIn addition, while we believe that there are numerous target businesses that we could potentially acquire, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our available financial resources. We may need to obtain additional financing in order to consummate future acquisitions and business opportunities and cannot assure you that any additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, or that the terms of our existing financing arrangements will not limit our ability to do so. This inherent competitive limitation could give others an advantage in pursuing acquisitions and business opportunities.\nWe face certain risks associated with the acquisition or disposition of businesses or entry into joint ventures.\nIn pursuing our corporate strategy, we may acquire, dispose of or exit businesses or reorganize our existing business. The success of this strategy is dependent upon our ability to identify appropriate opportunities, negotiate transactions on favorable terms, obtain funding and ultimately complete such transactions. Acquisitions (including SingleHop), dispositions, joint ventures and other complex transactions are accompanied by a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\ndifficulty integrating the operations, control environments and personnel of acquired companies;\n\u2022\npotential disruption of our ongoing business;\n\u2022\npotential distraction of management and other key personnel;\n\u2022\ndiversion of business resources from core operations;\n\u2022\nexpenses and potential liabilities related to the transactions, dispositions or acquired business;\n\u2022\nfailure to realize synergies or other expected benefits;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in maintaining controls, procedures, and policies,\n\u2022\nobtaining funding or other sources of liquidity on competitive terms, if at all; and\n\u2022\nincreased accounting charges such as impairment of goodwill or intangible assets, amortization of intangible assets acquired and a reduction in the useful lives of intangible assets acquired.\nAny inability to identify and integrate completed acquisitions or combinations in an efficient and timely manner could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. As we complete acquisitions, we may encounter difficulty in incorporating acquired personnel, technologies and services into our offerings while maintaining the quality standards that are consistent with our business operations, brand and reputation. If we are not successful in completing acquisitions or other strategic transactions that we may pursue in the future, we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management time and resources without a successful result. Future acquisitions could require use of substantial portions of our available cash, require us to borrow funds on terms that are less advantageous than our current borrowing arrangements or result in dilutive issuances of securities. Technology sharing or other strategic relationships we enter into may give rise to disputes over intellectual property ownership, operational responsibilities and other significant matters. Such disputes may be expensive and time-consuming to resolve and adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nWe intend to increase our size in the future, and may experience difficulties in managing growth.\nWe have adopted a business strategy that contemplates that we will expand our operations, including engaging future acquisitions or entering into other business opportunities, and as a result we are required to increase our level of corporate functions, which may include hiring additional personnel to perform such administrative functions and enhancing our IT systems. Any future growth may increase our corporate operating costs and expenses, administrative headcount and impose significant added responsibilities on members of our management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain and integrate additional employees and implement enhanced IT systems. Our future financial performance and our ability to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth effectively.\nWe may become involved in various types of litigation or other legal proceedings that may adversely impact our business.\nFrom time to time, we are or may become involved in various legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business, including patent, commercial, product liability, employment, class action, whistleblower and other litigation and claims, and governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings. Even if any individual matter is not material to our business, the effect of such matters can be time-consuming, divert management\u2019s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses even if the claims are without merit.\nFurthermore, because such matters are inherently unpredictable, there can be no assurance that the results of any of these matters will not have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. While we are protected by the automatic stay as a result of filing of the Chapter 11 Cases, litigation may be resolved against us after the conclusion of the Chapter 11 Cases.\nDeterioration of global economic conditions could adversely affect our business.\nThe global economy and capital and credit markets have experienced exceptional turmoil and upheaval over the past several years and may experience similar issues in the future. Many major economies worldwide could enter significant economic slowdowns or recessions and continue to experience economic weakness, with the potential for another economic downturn to occur. For example, in early 2020, certain economies and economic conditions have experienced turmoil due to outbreaks of the coronavirus (COVID-19). To the extent economic conditions could impair our customers\u2019 ability to profitably monetize the content we deliver on their behalf, they may reduce or eliminate the traffic we deliver for them. Such reductions in traffic could lead to a reduction in our revenue. Additionally, in a down-cycle or low growth economic environment, we may experience the negative effects of increased competitive pricing pressure, customer loss, a slowdown in commerce over the Internet and corresponding decrease in traffic delivered over our network and failures by customers to pay amounts owed to us on a timely basis or at all. Suppliers or vendors on which we rely on for various services could also be negatively impacted by economic conditions that, in turn, could have a negative impact on our operations or expenses.\nThe availability, cost and terms of credit also may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid markets and wider credit spreads. Concern about the stability of the markets generally, and the strength of counterparties specifically, may lead many lenders and institutional investors to reduce credit to businesses and consumers. These factors led to a decrease in spending by businesses and consumers over the past several years, and a corresponding slowdown in global infrastructure spending. Any of these credit problems could have a negative impact on our operations or expenses.\nWe and our customers and suppliers face various risks related to epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks of infectious diseases, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nEpidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks of an illness, disease or virus that affect countries, states, cities or regions in which we or our customers or suppliers operate, and actions taken to contain or prevent their further spread, may have a material and adverse impact on\ngeneral commercial and economic activity and on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks of an illness, disease or virus, such as the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), have already resulted in, and could result in further, governmental measures being implemented to control the spread of such illness, disease or virus, including quarantines, travel restrictions, social distancing, business restrictions, declarations of states of emergency, business shutdown, prioritization and allocation of resources, and restrictions on the movement of our employees and those of our customers and suppliers on which we rely. All of these could adversely affect our ability and their respective abilities to adequately manage our and their respective businesses. Risks related to epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks of an illness, disease or virus could also lead to the complete or partial closure of one or more of our facilities or our customers\u2019 or suppliers\u2019 facilities, or otherwise result in significant disruptions to our or their business and operations. Such events could materially and adversely impact our operations and the revenue we generate from our customers.\nWe have instituted policies requiring most of our employees to work remotely in certain cases and such policies may remain in place for an indeterminate amount of time. There can be no assurance that our technological systems or infrastructure is or will be equipped to facilitate effective remote working arrangements for our employees. If key personnel that operate our data centers are prohibited from working on site or are otherwise unavailable to provide services, our business and operations will be adversely affected. Moreover, pandemics or outbreaks of an illness, disease or virus could disrupt our technology and other development activities and lead to service level disruptions. If any such delay or disruption were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.\nIn addition, risks related to epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks of an illness, disease or virus have begun and may continue to adversely affect the economies in impacted countries, including the United States, and the global financial markets, which have begun and may continue to experience significant volatility, potentially leading to an economic downturn that could adversely affect our and our customers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 respective businesses, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. The ultimate extent of the impact of any epidemic, pandemic or other outbreak of an illness, disease or virus on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity or length of such epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks of an illness, disease or virus and actions taken to contain or prevent their further spread, among others. These and other potential impacts of epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks of an illness, disease or virus could therefore materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our international operations.\nWe operate in international markets, and may in the future consummate additional investments in or acquisitions of foreign businesses. Our international operations are subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\npolitical conditions and events, including embargo;\n\u2022\nrestrictive actions by U.S. and foreign governments;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of withholding or other taxes on foreign income, tariffs or restrictions on foreign trade and investment;\n\u2022\nadverse tax consequences, including the imposition of digital taxes by foreign governments;\n\u2022\nlimitations on repatriation of earnings and cash;\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange controls and import/export quotas;\n\u2022\nnationalization, expropriation, asset seizure, blockades and blacklisting;\n\u2022\nlimitations in the availability, amount or terms of insurance coverage;\n\u2022\nloss of contract rights and inability to adequately enforce contracts;\n\u2022\npolitical instability, war and civil disturbances or other risks that may limit or disrupt markets, such as terrorist attacks, piracy and kidnapping;\n\u2022\noutbreaks of pandemic diseases, fear of such outbreaks or economic disturbances due to such outbreaks;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates associated with non-U.S. operations (including as a result of Brexit), hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange that affect demand for our services and our profitability;\n\u2022\npotential noncompliance with a wide variety of anti-corruption laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the \"FCPA\"), and other non-U.S. laws and regulations, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 (the \"Bribery Act\"), and Modern Slavery Act 2015;\n\u2022\nlabor strikes and shortages;\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic and political conditions;\n\u2022\nadverse changes in foreign laws or regulatory requirements; and\n\u2022\ndifferent liability standards and legal systems that may be less developed and less predictable than those in the United States.\nIf we are unable to adequately address these risks, we could lose our ability to operate in certain international markets, face fines or sanctions, incur significant expenses or liabilities and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nThe U.S. Departments of Justice, Commerce, Treasury and other agencies and authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seek to impose against companies for violations of export controls, the FCPA, and other federal statutes, sanctions and regulations, including those established by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"OFAC\") and, increasingly, similar or more restrictive foreign laws, rules and regulations. By virtue of these laws and regulations, and under laws and regulations in other jurisdictions, including the European Union and the United Kingdom, we may be obliged to limit our business activities, we may incur costs for compliance programs and we may be subject to enforcement actions or penalties for noncompliance.\nIn recent years, U.S. and foreign governments have increased their oversight and enforcement activities with respect to these laws and we expect the relevant agencies to continue to increase these activities. A violation of these laws, sanctions or regulations could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company has compliance policies in place for its employees with respect to FCPA, OFAC and similar laws. However, there can be no assurance that our employees, consultants or agents, or those of our subsidiaries or investees, will not engage in conduct for which we may be held responsible. Violations of the FCPA, the Bribery Act, the rules and regulations established by OFAC and other laws, sanctions or regulations may result in severe criminal or civil penalties, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFurthermore, significant developments stemming from the 2016 U.S. presidential election and subsequent 2018 mid-term elections could have a material adverse effect on us. The U.S. presidential administration has expressed antipathy towards existing trade agreements, and proposed trade agreements greater restrictions on free trade generally and significant increases on tariffs on goods imported into the United States, particularly from China. Changes in U.S. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories and countries where we currently develop and sell products, and any negative sentiments towards the United States as a result of such changes, could adversely affect our business. In addition, negative sentiments towards the United States among non-U.S. customers and among non-U.S. employees or prospective employees could adversely affect sales or hiring and retention, respectively.\nGlobal or local climate change and natural resource conservation regulations or requirements could adversely impact our business.\nOur operations, including our data centers and server networks, require and consume significant energy resources, including electricity generated by the burning of fossil fuels. In response to concerns about global climate change, governments may adopt new regulations affecting the use of fossil fuels or requiring the use of alternative fuel sources to power energy resources that serve our operations. In addition, our customers and investors may require us to take steps to demonstrate that we are taking ecologically responsible measures in operating our business. The costs and any expenses we incur to make our network more energy efficient or administrative matters certifying our power usage or environmental impact could make us less profitable in future periods. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other requirements imposed on us could lead to fines, lost revenue and damage to our reputation.\nRisks Related to our Capital Structure and Other Business Risks\nWe have a history of losses and may not achieve or sustain profitability.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, we incurred a net loss attributable to shareholders of $138.3 million, $61.2 million, and $44.2 million, respectively. At December 31, 2019, our accumulated deficit was $1.5 billion and our working capital deficit was $442.0 million. Given the competitive and evolving nature of the industry in which we operate, we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability, and our failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our business, including our ability to raise additional funds or refinance our current levels of indebtedness.\nOur results of operations have fluctuated in the past and likely will continue to fluctuate, which could negatively impact our ability to raise additional capital and execute our business plan.\nWe have experienced fluctuations in our results of operations on a quarterly and annual basis. We expect to experience continued fluctuations in our operating results in the foreseeable future due to a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\ncompetition and the introduction of new services by our competitors;\n\u2022\ncontinued pricing pressures;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the demand and sales cycle for our services;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the market for qualified sales, technical, customer support and retention and other personnel;\n\u2022\nthe cost and availability of adequate public utility services, including access to power;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain local loop connections to our POPs at favorable prices; and\n\u2022\nany impairment or restructuring charges that we may incur in the future.\nIn addition, fluctuations in our results of operations may arise from strategic decisions we have made or may make with respect to the timing and magnitude of capital expenditures such as those associated with the expansion of our data center facilities, the deployment of additional POPs, the terms of our network connectivity purchase agreements and the cost of servers, storage and other equipment necessary to deploy hosting and cloud services. A relatively large portion of our expenses are fixed in the short-term, particularly with respect to lease and personnel expense, depreciation and amortization and interest expense. Our results of operations, therefore, are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in revenue. We can offer no assurance that the results of any particular period are an indication of future performance in our business operations. Fluctuations in our results of operations could have a negative impact on our ability to raise additional capital and execute our business plan.\nWe have substantial goodwill and amortizable intangible assets.\nOur financial statements reflect substantial goodwill and intangible assets, approximately $71.2 million and $46.6 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2019, that was recognized in connection with acquisitions.\nWe annually (and more frequently if changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired) review the carrying amount of our goodwill to determine whether it has been impaired for accounting purposes. In general, if the fair value of the corresponding reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, we record an impairment. The determination of fair value is dependent upon a number of factors, including assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates that are based on our current and long-term business plans. With respect to the amortizable intangible assets, we test recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Examples of such circumstances include, but are not limited to, operating or cash flow losses from the use of such assets or changes in our intended uses of such assets. If we determine that an asset or asset group is not recoverable, then we would record an impairment charge if the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. Fair value is based on estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. The assumptions underlying cash flow projections would represent management\u2019s best estimates at the time of the impairment review.\nAs the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of our remaining goodwill and intangible assets are assessed, changes in the economic conditions, changes to our business strategy, changes in operating performance or other indicators of impairment could cause us to realize impairment charges in the future, including as a result of restructuring undertaken in connection with the integration of acquisitions.\nIf we determine an impairment exists, we may be required to write off all or a portion of the goodwill and associated intangible assets related to any impaired business. For additional information, see the discussion under \"Critical Accounting Policies\" in Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we wrote off approximately $45.0 million of our goodwill and approximately $14.1 million of our intangible assets. For additional information regarding impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report.\nWe have incurred and may incur additional goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges, restructuring charges or both.\nThe assumptions, inputs and judgments used in performing the valuation analysis and assessments of goodwill and other intangible assets are inherently subjective and reflect estimates based on known facts and circumstances at the time the valuation is performed. The use of different assumptions, inputs and judgments or changes in circumstances could materially affect the results of the valuation and assessments. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results could differ from our estimates. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded an impairment of $45.0 million for goodwill and $14.1 million for intangible assets. Based on our evaluation of various estimates, further impairments may occur.\nWhen circumstances warrant, we may elect to exit certain business activities or change the manner in which we conduct ongoing operations. When we make such a change, we will estimate the costs to exit a business or restructure ongoing operations. The components of the estimates may include estimates and assumptions regarding the timing and costs of future events and activities that represent our best expectations based on known facts and circumstances at the time of estimation. Should circumstances warrant, we will adjust our previous estimates to reflect what we then believe to be a more accurate representation of expected future costs. Because our estimates and assumptions regarding impairment and restructuring charges include probabilities of future events, such as expected operating results, future economic conditions, the ability to find a sublease tenant within a reasonable period of time or the rate at which a sublease tenant will pay for the available space, such estimates are inherently subject to changes due to unforeseen circumstances that could\nmaterially and adversely affect our results of operations. Adverse changes in any of these factors could result in additional impairment and restructuring charges in the future.\nChanges in U.S. tax laws could have an effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur business operations are subject to taxation in the U.S. and several other countries. Changes in tax laws or tax rulings, or changes to interpretations of existing laws, could materially affect our financial position and results from business operations.\nWe may not be able to fully utilize our U.S. net operating loss and other tax carryforwards.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had net operating loss (\"NOL\") carryforwards for federal tax purposes of $341.2 million, of which $285.2 million will expire in tax years 2020 through 2037, and $56.0 million will not expire. Our ability to utilize our NOL carryforwards to reduce taxable income in future years may be limited if sufficient future taxable income is not timely generated. Additionally, our ability to fully utilize the NOL carryforwards are adversely affected by \"ownership changes\" within the meaning of Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Tax Code\"). An ownership change is generally defined as a greater than 50% increase in equity ownership by \"5% shareholders\" (as that term is defined for purposes of Sections 382 of the Tax Code) in any three-year period.\nWe entered into a rights agreement on December 18, 2019, with American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, as Rights Agent (the \"NOL Rights Agreement\") to reduce the risk that the Company\u2019s ability to use its net operating losses and certain other tax assets (collectively, \"Tax Benefits\") would become subject to limitations due to an \"ownership change\" as defined in Section 382 of the Tax Code. The NOL Rights Agreement is designed to reduce the likelihood that the Company will experience an ownership change under Section 382 of the Tax Code by (i) discouraging any person or group from becoming a 4.9% stockholder and (ii) discouraging any existing 4.9% or more stockholder from acquiring additional shares of the Company\u2019s stock.\nAdditionally, on March 16, 2020, the Company filed the Chapter 11 Cases and emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases under the Plan may result in an ownership change under Section 382. If an ownership change under Section 382 does occur, then the amount of NOLs available for utilization against future taxable income of the Company could be significantly limited.\nWe may face litigation and liability due to claims of infringement of third party intellectual property rights and due to our customers\u2019 use of our IT infrastructure services.\nThe IT infrastructure services industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement. From time-to-time, third parties may assert patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business. Any claims that our IT infrastructure services infringe or may infringe proprietary rights of third parties, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, any of which could negatively impact our operating results. In addition, our customer agreements generally require us to indemnify our customers for expenses and liabilities resulting from claimed infringement of patents or copyrights of third parties, subject to certain limitations. If an infringement claim against us were to be successful, and we were not able to obtain a license to the relevant technology or a substitute technology on acceptable terms or redesign our services or products to avoid infringement, our ability to compete successfully in our market would be materially impaired.\nIn addition, our customers use our IT infrastructure services to operate and run certain aspects and functions of their businesses. From time-to-time, third parties may assert that our customers\u2019 businesses, including the business aspects and functions for which they use our IT infrastructure services, infringe patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret or other intellectual property or legal rights. Our customers\u2019 businesses may also be subject to regulatory oversight, governmental investigation, data breaches and lawsuits by their customers, competitors or other third parties based on a broad range of legal theories. Such third parties may seek to hold us liable on the basis of our contracts with them, contributory or vicarious liability or other legal theories. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, any of which could negatively impact our operating results. If any such claim against us were to be successful, damages could be material and our ability to compete successfully in our market would be materially impaired.\nWe may not be successful in protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nWe rely primarily on patent, trademark, and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our proprietary rights, all of which provide only limited protection. We currently have 18 patents issued in the U.S. and internationally. Our issued patents may be contested, circumvented, found unenforceable or invalidated and we may expend significant amounts to protect our intellectual property.\nWe endeavor to enter into agreements with our employees, contractors, and third parties with whom we do business to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information. The steps we have taken, however, may not prevent unauthorized use, disclosure or the reverse engineering of our technology. Moreover, others may independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent, superior to, or otherwise competitive to the technologies we employ in our services or that infringe our intellectual property. We may be unable to prevent competitors from acquiring trademarks or service marks and other proprietary rights that are similar to, infringe upon, or diminish the value of our trademarks and service marks and our other proprietary rights. Enforcement of our intellectual property rights also depends on successful legal actions against infringers and parties who misappropriate our proprietary information and trade secrets, but these actions may not be successful, even when our rights have been infringed.\nIn addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. Despite the measures taken by us, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology and information without our authorization. Policing unauthorized use of our proprietary technologies and other intellectual property and our services is difficult, and litigation or other actions could become necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights. Any litigation could be time consuming and expensive to prosecute or resolve, result in substantial diversion of management attention and resources, and harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe insurance coverage that we purchase may prove to be inadequate, costly or unavailable when we need the coverage.\nWe carry liability, property, directors and officers, business interruption, Cyber and other insurance policies to cover insurable risks to our company. We select the types of insurance, the limits and the deductibles based on our specific risk profile, the cost of the insurance coverage versus its perceived benefit and general industry standards. Our insurance policies contain industry standard exclusions for events such as war. Although we generally attempt to select reputable insurance carriers, any economic disruptions may prevent us from using our insurance if the counterparty does not have the capital necessary to meet the coverage. In addition, our agreements with customers also contain obligations to carry comprehensive general liability, property, workers\u2019 compensation, and automobile liability insurance. Any of the limits of insurance that we purchase could prove to be inadequate, or the cost of such insurance policies may be significant, which could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur significant amount of indebtedness could materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and ability to compete in our industry.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our total debt, including finance leases, was $608.3 million. In connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, we entered into the DIP Facility on March 19, 2020, which is described above under Item 1 \"Business - Recent Developments.\u201d Our DIP Facility requires us to, among other things, meet certain affirmative and negative financial covenants. These covenants protect the lenders and limit our ability to make certain operating and business decisions in the face of changing market dynamics. These covenants can be waived by the lenders. However, the cost of waivers, if obtained, could be material. In addition, our credit facility and the DIP Facility create liens on a majority of our assets. We can make no assurances that we will be able to comply with our covenants in the future or whether we will be able to obtain future amendments or waivers of the covenants in our financing agreements and instruments, if necessary, upon acceptable terms or at all. Furthermore, future amendments or waivers may place future restrictions on our ability to engage in certain activities, as well as increase the cost of our financing.\nIf our financial performance weakens or if we are unable to make interest or principal payments when due, meet our covenants or amend our financing agreements, particularly the DIP Facility to modify the covenants, we may default under such financing agreements. Such default would result in all principal and interest becoming due and payable, if not waived. This would have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If a waiver is required, we may not be able to obtain the waiver, or it could come at a material cost to us.\nWe also have other long-term commitments for operating leases and service and purchase contracts. If we are unable to make payments when due, we would be in breach of contractual terms of the agreements, which may result in disruptions of our services which, in turn, would have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur significant amount of indebtedness could materially adversely affect us. For example, it could: require us to (i) dedicate a significant portion of our cash flows from operations and investing activities to make payments on our debt, which would reduce our ability to fund working capital, make capital expenditures or other general corporate purposes, (ii) increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions (such as credit-related disruptions), (iii) place us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that have proportionately less debt or comparable debt at more favorable interest rates or on better terms; and (iv) limit our ability to react to competitive pressures, or make it difficult for us to carry out capital spending that is necessary or important to our strategy. Any of these factors could materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and ability to compete in our industry.\nTo service our significant indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash. However, our ability to generate cash depends on many factors many of which are beyond our control.\nOur ability to make payments on and refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. If we use more cash than we generate in the future or fail to generate cash, our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our future operations by increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions and by limiting or prohibiting our ability to obtain additional financing for future capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes. We can make no assurances that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness when due, or to fund our other liquidity needs. In these circumstances, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. Without this financing, we could be forced to sell assets or secure additional financing to make up for any shortfall in our payment obligations under unfavorable circumstances. However, we may not be able to secure additional financing on terms favorable to us or at all.\nThere is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe Company has experienced negative financial trends, such as operating losses, working capital deficiencies, negative cash flows and other adverse key financial ratios. The Company reported a net loss attributable to shareholders of $138.3 million and $61.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The working capital deficit as of December 31, 2019 was $442.0 million compared to $6.5 million as of December 31, 2018. These matters, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. The audit report of our independent registered public accounting firm as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and for the three years ended December 31, 2019 contains an explanatory paragraph, Going Concern Uncertainty, that raises substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. Future reports on our financial statements may also include an explanatory paragraph with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nA failure of our controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe regularly review and update our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system will be met. Any failure of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or are otherwise required to restate our financial statements, we could be required to implement expensive and time-consuming remedial measures. In addition, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, and expose us to legal or regulatory proceedings.", "PERMNO": 87236, "SIC": 7374, "TIC": "INAPQ"}
