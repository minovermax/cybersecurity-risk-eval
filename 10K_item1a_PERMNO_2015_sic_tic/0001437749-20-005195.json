The risks described below are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations in future periods.\nA significant portion of our revenues is derived from oil and gas activities on our lands. We rely on third parties to conduct that activity.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct oil and gas exploration and production activity on our lands. If we are not successful in attracting third parties to conduct that activity or if there is any significant interruption in existing activity on our lands, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, would be adversely affected. Additionally, our ability to generate future earnings depends on third parties finding new production on our land to replace present production as it is depleted. Oil and gas prices, as well as new technology, will affect the possibility of replacing present production.\nOur revenues could be negatively impacted by declines in commodity prices for oil, natural gas, and timber, among others.\nWe earn a significant portion of our operating income from the sale of commodities produced from our lands: oil and gas, and timber. Fluctuations in the prices for these commodities will directly impact our cash flow, net income and financial condition.\nAdditionally, because certain of our lands are leased to farmers, declines in the commodity prices for the crops they grow may impact their ability to make lease payments, and therefore could adversely affect our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations and properties could be adversely affected by hurricanes or other adverse weather events, natural disasters, or other significant disruptions.\nOur properties are located principally in southwest Louisiana, where major hurricanes and flooding have occurred. Depending on where any hurricane makes landfall or flooding occurs, our properties could be significantly damaged, and income-producing activities on our properties could be disrupted. In addition, the occurrence and frequency of hurricanes and flooding in Louisiana could also negatively impact demand for the use of our real estate assets because of perceptions of hurricane and flooding risks. In addition to hurricanes, the occurrence of other natural disasters and climate conditions in Louisiana, such as tornadoes, fires, unusually heavy or prolonged rain, droughts, and heat waves, could have an adverse effect on our ability to use our properties or realize income from our properties.\nWe have approximately 10,601 net acres of timberland in various stages of growth or age classes. A typical pine timber stand will be harvested after 30 to 35 years of growth with some thinning occurring during this time. A hardwood stand will be harvested after 45 to 50 years of growth. A natural disaster can have a material adverse effect on timber growth, reducing its value. Natural disasters that could affect our timber lands include a hurricane, tornado, high winds, heavy rains and flooding, and/or fire caused by lightning or other sources.\nIf any of the events described above occurs, we may experience disruptions to our operations and damage to our properties, which could have an adverse effect on our business, our financial condition, our results of operations, and our cash flows.\nOur land holdings are concentrated in southwest Louisiana, and we therefore may suffer economic harm because of adverse conditions in that region.\nOur land holdings are located principally in southwest Louisiana. Due to the concentration of our properties in this area, our performance is dependent on local economic conditions. This area has experienced periods of economic decline in the past and may do so in the future.\nWe rely on third party managers for day-to-day property management of certain of our properties.\nWe rely on local third-party managers for the day-to-day management of our timberland properties. The cash flows from our timberland properties may be adversely affected if the property manager fails to provide quality services. These third-party managers may fail to manage our properties effectively or in accordance with the terms of our agreement with them. If any of these events occur, we could incur losses or face liabilities from the loss or injury to our property or to persons at our properties. In addition, disputes may arise between us and third-party managers, and we may incur significant expenses to resolve those disputes or terminate the relevant agreement with the third parties and locate and engage competent and cost-effective alternative service providers to manage the relevant properties. Additionally, third party managers may manage and own other properties that may compete with our properties, which may result in conflicts of interest and decisions regarding the operation of our properties that are not in our best interests.\nPotential environmental liabilities could result in substantial costs to us or cause our land to lose value.\nUnder federal, state, and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, we may be required to investigate and clean up the effects of releases of hazardous substances or petroleum products on our properties because of current or past ownership or operation of oil and gas activities on our lands. If previously unidentified environmental problems arise, we may have to make substantial payments, which could adversely affect our cash flow. As an owner of properties, we may have to pay for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred in connection with a contamination. The law typically imposes cleanup responsibility and liability regardless of whether an owner knew of or caused the contamination. Changes in environmental regulations or the discovery of environmental damage on our lands may cause the value of our lands to decline, may impact the development potential of our undeveloped land or could increase operating costs due to the cost of complying with new regulations.\nOur overall business is subject to risks associated with the real estate industry.\nWe are subject to all risks related to investment in real estate, many of which relate to the general lack of liquidity of real estate investments, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf\nchanges in general or local economic conditions where our properties are located;\n\u25cf\nlack of availability of financing at favorable rates (or at all) that may render the purchase, sale or refinancing of a property more difficult or unattractive;\n\u25cf\nchanges in real estate and zoning laws; and\n\u25cf\nincreases in real estate taxes and insurance costs.\nOur common stock may not have an active, liquid, and orderly trading market, and our stock price may be volatile.\nOur common stock may not have an active, liquid, and orderly trading market due to the relatively low number of shares that are available for trading. Active, liquid, and orderly trading markets usually result in less price volatility and more efficiency in carrying out purchase and sale orders. The trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate and cause price variations to occur.\nThe market price of our common stock could also vary significantly because of a number of other factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u25cf\nactual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results or dividends;\n\u25cf\nchanges in our results of operations or cash flows;\n\u25cf\npublication of research reports about us or the real estate industry;\n\u25cf\nchanges in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u25cf\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\u25cf\nthe realization of any of the other risk factors presented in this annual report;\n\u25cf\nthe extent of investor interest in our common stock;\n\u25cf\nour underlying asset value;\n\u25cf\ninvestor confidence in the stock and bond markets, generally;\n\u25cf\nchanges in tax laws; and\n\u25cf\ngeneral market and economic conditions.\nIf the per share trading price of our common stock declines significantly, stockholders may be unable to resell their shares at or above the price paid for them. We cannot assure stockholders that the per share trading price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the price of their common stock. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and our ability to pay dividends on, and the per share trading price of, our common stock.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting were not effective in the past.\nOur principal executive and financial officer evaluated our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, and concluded that as of that date, they were not effective due to material weaknesses. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In addition, as a result of the material weaknesses, our principal executive and financial officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2018, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. We remediated our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting throughout 2019, and our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of December 31, 2019. Nevertheless, we have only one part-time employee, who is both our principal executive and financial officer. In the future, our lack of internal staff could lead to new material weaknesses that would render our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting ineffective. Until any such future material weaknesses are remediated, they could lead to errors in our financial results and other public filings, which could have an adverse effect on our business, our financial condition, our results of operations, and our cash flows.", "PERMNO": 89948, "SIC": 6792, "TIC": "CKX"}
