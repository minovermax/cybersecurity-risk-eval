You should consider carefully the risks described below, together with other information in this Annual Report and other public filings, before making investment decisions regarding our securities. If any of the following events actually occur, our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. This could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline and you may lose all or part of your investment. Moreover, the risks described below are not the only ones that we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition.\nSummary Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that you should consider before investing in our common stock. Set forth below is a summary of the principal risks we face:\n\uf0b7We will need substantial additional funds to progress the clinical trial program for our drug candidates, and to develop new compounds. The actual amount of funds we will need will be determined by a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control;\n\uf0b7We are a clinical research and development stage company and are likely to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future;\n\uf0b7The results of pre-clinical studies and completed clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, and our current drug candidates may not have favorable results in later studies or trials;\n\uf0b7The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, or other pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease may materially and adversely impact our business, including our preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\uf0b7Changes in drug candidate manufacturing or formulation may result in additional costs or delay;\n\uf0b7If KKC or other parties with whom we collaborate on the development and commercialization of our drug candidates do not satisfy their obligations, do not otherwise pursue development or commercialization of our drug candidates or if they terminate their agreements with us, we may not be able to develop or commercialize our drug candidates;\n\uf0b7We are subject to significant obligations to Presage in connection with our license of voruciclib, and we may become subject to significant obligations in connection with future licenses we obtain, which could adversely affect the overall profitability of any products we may seek to commercialize, and such licenses of drug candidates, the development and commercialization for which we are solely responsible, may never become profitable;\n\uf0b7Our business strategy may include entry into additional collaborative or license agreements. We may not be able to enter into collaborative or license agreements or may not be able to negotiate commercially acceptable terms for these agreements;\n\uf0b7Final approval by regulatory authorities of our drug candidates for commercial use may be delayed, limited or prevented, any of which would adversely affect our ability to generate operating revenues;\n\uf0b7The FDA may determine that our drug candidates have undesirable side effects that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval or commercialization;\n\uf0b7If we experience delays or difficulties in the enrolment of patients in clinical trials, our completion of clinical trials and receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented;\n\uf0b7Changes in funding for the FDA and other government agencies or future government shutdowns could cause delays in the submission and regulatory review of marketing applications, which could negatively impact our business or prospects;\n\uf0b7Failure to obtain regulatory approval in foreign jurisdictions would prevent us from marketing our products internationally;\n\uf0b7Any designation granted by the FDA for any of our product candidates may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process, and does not increase the likelihood that our product candidates will receive marketing approval. We may also not be able to obtain or maintain any such designation;\n\uf0b7Any orphan drug designations we receive may not confer marketing exclusivity or other benefits;\n\uf0b7Even if we or our licensees receive regulatory approval to commercialize our drug candidates, our ability to generate revenues from any resulting products will be subject to a variety of risks, many of which are out of our control;\n\uf0b7If any products we develop become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, our ability to successfully commercialize our products will be impaired;\n\uf0b7Our drug candidates are subject to ongoing government regulation both before and after regulatory approval;\n\uf0b7We may not be able to establish the contractual arrangements necessary to develop, market and distribute our drug candidates;\n\uf0b7Our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated if competitors develop and market products that are more effective, have fewer side effects or are less expensive than our drug candidates;\n\uf0b7Our product candidates may face competition sooner than anticipated;\n\uf0b7We rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials and pre-clinical studies. If those parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, our drug candidates may not advance in a timely manner or at all;\n\uf0b7We will depend on third party suppliers and contract manufacturers for the manufacturing of our drug candidates and have no direct control over the cost of manufacturing our drug candidates. Increases in the cost of manufacturing our drug candidates would increase our costs of conducting clinical trials and could adversely affect our future profitability;\n\uf0b7We rely on acquisitions or licenses from third parties to expand our pipeline of drug candidates;\n\uf0b7Our commercial success is dependent, in part, on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and preserving trade secrets, which cannot be guaranteed;\n\uf0b7Claims by other companies that we infringe on their proprietary technology may result in liability for damages or stop our development and commercialization efforts;\n\uf0b7We may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that our employees or we have misappropriated their intellectual property, or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property;\n\uf0b7We may be subject to substantial costs stemming from our defense against third-party intellectual property infringement claims;\n\uf0b7We face a risk of product liability claims and claims may exceed our insurance limits;\n\uf0b7Our employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial partners, principal investigators, or CROs may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business;\n\uf0b7Our business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures;\n\uf0b7Our efforts will be seriously jeopardized if we are unable to retain and attract key employees;\n\uf0b7Negative U.S. and global economic conditions may pose challenges to our business strategy, which relies on funding from the financial markets or collaborators;\n\uf0b7Laws, rules and regulations relating to public companies may be costly and impact our ability to attract and retain directors and executive officers;\n\uf0b7If we fail to establish and maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired, which would adversely affect our operating results, our ability to operate our business, and our stock price, and could result in litigation or similar actions;\n\uf0b7Security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer;\n\uf0b7If we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could harm our business;\n\uf0b7We or the third parties upon whom we depend may be adversely affected by natural disasters and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster;\n\uf0b7Limitations on the deductibility of net operating losses could adversely affect our business and financial condition;\n\uf0b7The trading price of the shares of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile and could decline in value and we may incur significant costs from class action litigation;\n\uf0b7Future sales of our common stock, including common stock issued upon exercise of outstanding warrants or options, may depress the market price of our common stock and cause stockholders to experience dilution;\n\uf0b7Because we do not intend to pay, and have not paid, any cash dividends on our shares of common stock, our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless the value of our common stock appreciates and they sell their shares;\n\uf0b7We will have broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds from any exercise of outstanding warrants and options;\n\uf0b7We are authorized to issue blank check preferred stock, which could adversely affect the holders of our common stock;\n\uf0b7Anti-takeover provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and third amended and restated bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt;\n\uf0b7Our third amended and restated bylaws require, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that derivative actions brought in our name, actions against our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders for breach of fiduciary duty and other similar actions may be brought only in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware and, if brought outside of Delaware, the stockholder bringing the suit will be deemed to have consented to service of process on such stockholder\u2019s counsel, which may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders; and\n\uf0b7Our executive officers and directors may sell shares of their stock, and these sales could adversely affect our stock price.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nRisks Related to Our Development Stage\nWe will need substantial additional funds to progress the clinical trial program for our drug candidates, and to develop new compounds. The actual amount of funds we will need will be determined by a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nWe will need substantial additional funds to progress the clinical trial program for our drug candidates and to develop any additional compounds. The factors that will determine the actual amount of funds that we will need to progress the clinical trial programs may include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\uf0b7the therapeutic indications for use being developed;\n\uf0b7the clinical trial endpoint required to achieve regulatory approval;\n\uf0b7the number of clinical trials required to achieve regulatory approval;\n\uf0b7the number of sites included in the trials;\n\uf0b7the length of time required to enroll suitable patients;\n\uf0b7the number of patients who participate in the trials and the rate that they are recruited;\n\uf0b7the number of treatment cycles patients complete while they are enrolled in the trials;\n\uf0b7costs and potential difficulties encountered in manufacturing sufficient drug product for the trials; and\n\uf0b7the efficacy and safety profile of the product.\nWe have been opportunistic in our efforts to obtain cash, and we expect to continue to evaluate various funding alternatives from time to time. If we obtain additional funding, it may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and may be dilutive to existing stockholders. If we are unable to obtain additional funds on favorable terms or at all, we may be required to cease or reduce our operations. We may sell additional shares of common stock, and securities exercisable for or convertible into shares of our common stock, or we may seek to obtain debt financing, in each case, to satisfy our capital and operating needs; however, such transactions will be subject to market conditions and there can be no assurance any such transactions will be completed.\nWe are a clinical research and development stage company and are likely to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future.\nYou should consider our prospects in light of the risks and difficulties frequently encountered by clinical research stage and developmental companies. We have incurred net losses of $327.8 million from our inception through June 30, 2021, including a net loss of $68.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2021 (excluding $18.1 million of non-cash gain resulting from a change in fair value of our warrant liability), a net loss of $23.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2020 (excluding $22.9 million of non-cash expense resulting from a change in fair value of our warrant liability), and a net loss of $44.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2019 (excluding $27.6 million of non-cash income resulting from a change in the fair value of our warrant liability). We anticipate that we will incur operating losses and negative operating cash flow for the foreseeable future. We have not yet commercialized any drug candidates and cannot be sure that we will ever be able to do so, or that we may ever become profitable.\nRisks Related to Our Clinical Trials\nThe results of pre-clinical studies and completed clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, and our current drug candidates may not have favorable results in later studies or trials.\nPre-clinical studies and Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials are an expensive and uncertain process that may take years to complete. Pre-clinical studies and Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials are usually not primarily designed to test the efficacy of a drug candidate, but rather to test safety, to study pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and to understand the drug candidate\u2019s side effects at various doses and schedules. Favorable results in early studies or trials, as well as small studies or trials, may not be repeated in later studies or trials, including ongoing pre-clinical studies, large-scale Phase 3 clinical trials, or other studies intended as registration trials, and our drug candidates in later-stage trials may fail to show desired safety and efficacy despite having progressed through earlier-stage trials. Interim and top-line results, as well as any results from post-hoc data analyses, may also not be predictive of the final results of a clinical study and/or may not support product approval. The FDA also generally does not accept post-hoc data analyses as support for regulatory approval.\nIn July 2020, we announced the discontinuation of the Phase 3 study conducted by Helsinn with respect to the use of pracinostat for the treatment of AML because of the failure to meet the primary endpoint of the study, despite prior encouraging results in our earlier Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials. The results of the Phase 3 pracinostat study for the treatment of AML may also impact the interpretation of the results from our pracinostat study for MDS. Moreover, comparisons of results across different studies should be viewed with caution as such comparisons are limited by a number of factors, including differences in study designs and populations. Such comparisons also will not provide a sufficient basis for any comparative claims following product approval. Unfavorable results from ongoing pre-clinical studies or\nclinical trials could result in delays, modifications or abandonment of ongoing or future clinical trials, or abandonment of a clinical program. Pre-clinical and clinical results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approvals or commercialization. Negative or inconclusive results or adverse medical events during a clinical trial could cause a clinical trial to be delayed, repeated or terminated, or a clinical program to be abandoned.\nThe outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, or other pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease may materially and adversely impact our business, including our preclinical studies and clinical trials.\nIn December 2019, the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, was identified in Wuhan, China. This virus has been declared a pandemic and has spread to multiple global regions. The outbreak and government measures taken in response have also had a significant impact, both direct and indirect, on businesses and commerce, as worker shortages have occurred; supply chains have been disrupted; facilities and production have been suspended; and demand for certain goods and services, such as medical services and supplies, has spiked, while demand for other goods and services, such as travel, has fallen. In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, \u201cshelter in place\u201d orders and other public health guidance measures were implemented across much of the United States, Europe and Asia, including in the locations of our offices, clinical trial sites, key vendors and partners. Although some of such orders have been lifted in certain geographic locations, such measures may be, and, in some cases, have been re-implemented due an increase in the number of positive cases of COVID-19 or severity thereof, including cases attributable to new variants. These restrictions, as well as government restrictions on travel and a lack of public confidence in the safety of air travel and the use of public transportation have reduced and may continue to reduce the willingness of patients to participate in our clinical trials and the ability of regulatory officials and clinical monitors to perform visits of our clinical trial locations. As a result, our clinical development program timelines have been and may continue to be negatively affected by COVID-19, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Despite the vaccination of a large portion of the U.S. adult population, a significant portion of the global adult population remains unvaccinated and effective vaccines for children have not yet been developed or approved. The ineffectiveness of vaccines or public perception thereof, including in combating the \u201cdelta\u201d variant or new variants of the virus, could lead to increased governmental restrictions and changes in public behavior adversely affecting the economy. Further, due to \u201cshelter in place\u201d orders and other public health guidance measures, we have implemented a work-from-home policy for all staff members excluding those necessary to maintain minimum basic operations. Our increased reliance on personnel working from home may negatively impact productivity, or disrupt, delay or otherwise adversely impact our business.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, or similar pandemics, and related \u201cshelter in place\u201d orders and other public health guidance measures, we have experienced disruptions that have materially and adversely impacted our clinical trials, including delays in patient enrollment. We may in the future experience disruptions that could materially and adversely impact our clinical trials, business, financial condition and results of operations, including:\n\uf0b7additional delays or difficulties in enrolling patients in our clinical trials, including the potential need to suspend or delay enrollment. By example, we experienced enrollment delays in our TIDAL study and could possibly in our COASTAL study;\n\uf0b7delays or difficulties in initiating or expanding clinical trials, including delays or difficulties with clinical site initiation and recruiting clinical site investigators and clinical site staff;\n\uf0b7increased rates of patients withdrawing from our clinical trials following enrollment as a result of contracting COVID-19 or other health conditions, due to social distancing measures or state law requirements, or being forced to quarantine;\n\uf0b7diversion of healthcare resources away from the conduct of clinical trials or the closure of clinical trial sites, including the diversion of hospitals serving as our clinical trial sites and hospital staff supporting the conduct of our clinical trials;\n\uf0b7the need to modify, suspend, postpone, or terminate clinical trials;\n\uf0b7the need to implement alternative study procedures, including alternative methods for drug candidate delivery and administration, alternative study sites, remote study procedures, and alternative methods to obtain subject informed consent;\n\uf0b7potential noncompliance or deviations from the protocol or regulatory requirements due to necessary safety or public health measures;\n\uf0b7interruption of key clinical trial activities, such as clinical trial site data monitoring, due to limitations on travel imposed or recommended by federal or state governments, employers and others or interruption of clinical trial subject visits and study procedures, which may impact the integrity of subject data and clinical study endpoints;\n\uf0b7interruption or delays in the operations of the FDA or other regulatory authorities, which may impact review and approval timelines and may limit our ability to interact with agency representatives;\n\uf0b7delays or disruptions in preclinical experiments and investigational new drug application-enabling studies due to restrictions of on-site staff and unforeseen circumstances at contract research organizations and vendors;\n\uf0b7interruption of, or delays in receiving, supplies of our product candidates from our contract manufacturing organizations and other clinical study materials due to staffing shortages, production slowdowns or stoppages, disruptions in delivery systems, and order prioritization of other companies' products, such as under the Defense Production Act;\n\uf0b7changes or deviations from manufacturing requirements, that may adversely affect our product candidates or that may require FDA pre-approval or notification;\n\uf0b7limitations on our ability to recruit and hire key personnel due to our inability to meet with candidates because of travel restrictions and \u201cshelter in place\u201d orders;\n\uf0b7limitations on employee resources that would otherwise be focused on the conduct of our preclinical studies and clinical trials, including because of sickness of employees or their families or the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people; and\n\uf0b7interruption or delays to our sourced discovery and clinical activities.\nThe foregoing may require that we consult with relevant review and ethics committees, IRBs, and the FDA. The foregoing may also impact the integrity of our study data. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may also increase the need for clinical trial patient monitoring and regulatory reporting of adverse effects.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the governmental response continues to rapidly evolve. In light of the COVID-19 outbreak, the FDA has issued a number of new guidance documents, including guidance related to the potential effect of the COVID-19 outbreak on many clinical trial programs. The FDA also issued guidance on additional steps that are required to maintain GMPs during the pandemic in addition to a number of other COVID-19 related guidance.\nThe extent to which the outbreak impacts our business, preclinical studies and clinical trials will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. If we or any of the third parties with whom we engage were to experience shutdowns or other business disruptions, our ability to conduct our business in the manner and on the timelines presently planned could be materially and negatively impacted.\nChanges in drug candidate manufacturing or formulation may result in additional costs or delay.\nAs drug candidates are developed through preclinical studies to late-stage clinical trials toward approval and commercialization, it is common that various aspects of the development program, such as manufacturing methods, manufacturing sites, formulation, and methods of delivery are altered along the way in an effort to optimize processes and results. Any of these changes could cause our drug candidates to perform differently and affect the results of planned clinical trials or other future clinical trials conducted with the altered materials. Such changes may also require additional studies to demonstrate the comparability of the product candidate using prior processes, formulation, or manufacturers, FDA notification, or FDA approval. Any of the foregoing could limit our future revenues and growth.\nRisks Related to Our Licensing and Collaboration Agreements\nIf KKC or other parties with whom we collaborate on the development and commercialization of our drug candidates do not satisfy their obligations, do not otherwise pursue development or commercialization of our drug candidates or if they terminate their agreements with us, we may not be able to develop or commercialize our drug candidates.\nIn April 2020, we entered into an agreement with KKC to collaborate on the development, manufacturing, and commercialization of zandelisib globally. The agreement substantially retains and consolidates the terms of the 2018 agreement with KKC to develop and commercialize in Japan. We may enter into additional agreements to collaborate with other third parties on the development, manufacturing or commercialization of our drug candidates in the future. In connection with these agreements, we may grant certain rights regarding the use of our patents and technology. The counterparties may be responsible for development, manufacturing or commercialization of our drug candidates and the costs related thereto.\nOur counterparties might not fulfill all of their obligations to us. In addition, the agreements with our counterparties provide the counterparties with substantial control of the development and commercialization of our drug candidates and discretion whether to devote resources to the full pursuit thereof. or otherwise fail to fully pursue the development and commercialization of our drug candidates Even without breaching their obligations to us, our counterparties may not devote adequate resources or otherwise pursue the development and commercialization of our drug candidates, whether as a result of their assessment of the likelihood of success of such efforts, for financial reasons or otherwise. Our ability to receive revenue from our drug candidates may be dependent upon their efforts. If they fail to devote adequate resources or otherwise do not successfully develop, commercialize or manufacture our drug candidates, we may not receive the future milestone payments or royalties provided for in the agreement. In addition, under certain circumstances, including our failure to satisfy our obligations under the agreement, the counterparty may have the right to terminate the agreement.\nWe could also become involved in disputes with our counterparties, which could lead to delays in or termination of the agreement and time-consuming and expensive litigation or arbitration.\nIf our counterparties are unwilling or unable to fulfill their obligations or otherwise fail to fully pursue the development and commercialization of our drug candidates or if the agreement is terminated, we may lack sufficient resources to develop and commercialize our\ndrug candidates on our own and may be unable to reach agreement with a suitable alternative collaborator. The failure to develop and commercialize our drug candidates would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, prospects and financial condition.\nWe are subject to significant obligations to Presage in connection with our license of voruciclib, and we may become subject to significant obligations in connection with future licenses we obtain, which could adversely affect the overall profitability of any products we may seek to commercialize, and such licenses of drug candidates, the development and commercialization for which we are solely responsible, may never become profitable.\nIn September 2017, we entered into a license agreement with Presage (\u201cthe Presage License Agreement\u201d). Under the terms of the agreement, Presage granted us exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize voruciclib, a clinical-stage, oral and selective CDK inhibitor, and related compounds. In exchange, we paid Presage $2.9 million and are obligated for additional potential payments of up to $181 million upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones. We will also pay mid-single-digit tiered royalties on the net sales of any product successfully developed pursuant to such agreement. We may enter into similar agreements in the future that require us to make significant payments upon obtainment of development, regulatory or commercial milestones. We may be obligated to make milestone or royalty payments when we do not have the cash on hand to make these payments or have available cash for our other development efforts. These milestone and royalty payments could adversely affect the overall profitability for us of any products that we may seek to commercialize. In addition, if we fail to comply with our obligations under the license agreement, the counterparty may have the right to terminate the agreement. In such a case, we would lose our rights to the intellectual property covered by the license agreement and we would not be able to develop, manufacture or commercialize our drug candidates.\nThe profitability of our license agreement with Presage depends on the successful development, regulatory approval and commercialization of voruciclib. We are solely responsible for the development and commercialization of voruciclib, including the related costs. Drug development is a long, expensive and uncertain process and delay or failure can occur at any stage of our clinical trials. We cannot be certain that we will ever receive regulatory approval for voruciclib or that it will be successfully commercialized, even if approved.\nOur business strategy may include entry into additional collaborative or license agreements. We may not be able to enter into collaborative or license agreements or may not be able to negotiate commercially acceptable terms for these agreements.\nOur current business strategy may include the entry into additional collaborative or license agreements for the development and commercialization of our drug and drug candidates. The negotiation and consummation of these types of agreements typically involve simultaneous discussions with multiple potential collaborators or licensees and require significant time and resources. In addition, in attracting the attention of pharmaceutical and biotechnology company collaborators or licensees, we compete with numerous other third parties with product opportunities as well as the collaborators\u2019 or licensees\u2019 own internal product opportunities. We may not be able to consummate collaborative or license agreements, or we may not be able to negotiate commercially acceptable terms for these agreements.\nIf we do enter into such arrangements, we could be dependent upon the subsequent success of these other parties in performing their respective responsibilities and the cooperation of our partners. Our collaborators may not cooperate with us or perform their obligations under our agreements with them. We cannot control the amount and timing of our collaborators\u2019 resources that will be devoted to researching our product candidates pursuant to our collaborative agreements with them or whether our collaborators will comply with the applicable regulatory requirements. Our collaborators may choose to pursue existing or alternative technologies in preference to those being developed in collaboration with us.\nUnder agreements with any collaborators or licensees we may work with in the future, we may rely significantly on them to, among other activities:\n\uf0b7fund research and development activities with us;\n\uf0b7pay us fees upon the achievement of milestones; and\n\uf0b7market for or with us any commercial products that result from our collaborations.\nIf we do not consummate collaborative or license agreements, we may use our financial resources more rapidly on our drug development efforts, continue to defer certain development activities or forego the exploitation of certain geographic territories, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects. Further, we may not be successful in overseeing any such collaborative arrangements. If we fail to establish and maintain necessary collaborative or license relationships, our business prospects could suffer.\nCollaboration agreements may not lead to development or commercialization of drug candidates in the most efficient manner, or at all. If any collaborations we might enter into do not result in the successful development and commercialization of drug candidates or if one of our collaborators subsequently terminates its agreement with us, we may not receive any future research funding or milestone or royalty payments under the collaboration. If we do not receive the funding we expect under the agreements, our development of our drug candidates could be delayed, and we may need additional resources to develop our drug candidates and our product platform. All of the risks relating to product development, regulatory approval and commercialization described in this Annual Report also apply to the activities of our\ncollaborators. Moreover, should our collaborators not comply with the applicable regulatory or legal requirements, we and/or they, may be subject to regulatory enforcement action.\nRisks Related to FDA and Non-U.S. Regulation\nFinal approval by regulatory authorities of our drug candidates for commercial use may be delayed, limited or prevented, any of which would adversely affect our ability to generate operating revenues.\nWe will not generate any operating revenue until we, a licensee, or a potential collaborator successfully commercialize one of our drug candidates. Currently, we have drug candidates at different stages of development, and each will need to successfully complete certain clinical studies and obtain regulatory approval before potential commercialization. We may experience unforeseen events during product development that may substantially delay or prevent product approval. For example, the FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB\u2019s requirements or if the trial poses an unexpected serious harm to clinical trial patients. The FDA or an IRB may also impose conditions on the conduct of a clinical trial. Clinical trial sponsors may also choose to discontinue clinical trials as a result of risks to clinical trial patients, a lack of favorable results, or changing business priorities.\nThe pre-clinical and clinical development, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, export, marketing and distribution, and other possible activities relating to our drug candidates are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may, either before or after product approval, subject us to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions that may negatively impact the approval of one or more of our drug candidates or otherwise negatively impact our business.\nNeither collaborators, licensees nor we are permitted to market a drug candidate in the United States until the particular drug candidate is approved for marketing by the FDA. Specific pre-clinical data, chemistry, manufacturing and controls data, a proposed clinical trial protocol and other information must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND application, and clinical trials may commence only after the IND application becomes effective. To market a new drug in the United States, we must submit to the FDA and obtain FDA approval of an NDA. An NDA must be supported by extensive clinical and pre-clinical data, as well as extensive information regarding chemistry, manufacturing and controls to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the drug candidate.\nObtaining approval of an NDA can be a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process. Regulatory approval of an NDA is not guaranteed. The number and types of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials that will be required for FDA approval varies depending on the drug candidate, the disease or condition that the drug candidate is designed to target and the regulations applicable to any particular drug candidate. The FDA may also require additional studies or data after a trial has begun or more studies or data than we otherwise have anticipated. For example, we are conducting a multi-arm, open-label, Phase 1b dose finding and expansion trial evaluating zandelisib as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies. Despite the time and expense exerted in pre-clinical and clinical studies, failure can occur at any stage, and we could encounter problems that delay our product candidate development, trigger additional requirements from the FDA, or that cause us to abandon clinical trials or to repeat or perform additional pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. The FDA can delay, limit or deny approval of a drug candidate for many reasons, and product candidate development programs may be delayed or may not be successful for many reasons including but not limited to, the following:\n\uf0b7the FDA or IRBs may not authorize us to commence, amend, or continue clinical studies;\n\uf0b7we may be required to amend our clinical studies in such a way that it compromises the study data or makes the ongoing conduct of the study is impracticable;\n\uf0b7there may be deviations from the clinical study protocol that may result in the need to drop patients from the study, increase the study enrollment size or duration, or that may compromise the reliability of the study and the resulting data;\n\uf0b7we may not be able to enroll a sufficient number of qualified patients for clinical trials in a timely manner or at all, patients may drop out of our clinical trials or be lost to follow-up at a higher rate than we anticipate, patients may not follow the clinical trial procedures, or the number of patients required for clinical trials may be larger than we anticipate;\n\uf0b7we may have delays in adding new investigators or clinical trial sites, or we may experience a withdrawal of clinical trial sites;\n\uf0b7the supply or quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates may be insufficient or inadequate, including as a result of global trade policies;\n\uf0b7a drug candidate may not be deemed adequately safe or effective for an intended use;\n\uf0b7the FDA may not find the data from pre-clinical studies and clinical trials sufficient;\n\uf0b7we may not be able to demonstrate that a product candidate provides an advantage over current standards of care or current or future competitive therapies in development;\n\uf0b7there may be changes to standard of care that impact the design and conduct of our trial, may result in studies no longer being clinically significant, may require that we change our studies once they have already commenced, or may result in other products being preferred over our product candidates, if they are approved;\n\uf0b7to the extent that we are developing drug candidates for use in combination with other products, clinical trials may be more complex, resulting data may be more difficult to interpret, we may not be able to demonstrate that clinical trial results are attributable to our drug candidate, or developments with respect to the other product or standard of care may impact our ability to obtain product approval for our drug candidate or to successfully market our drug candidate;\n\uf0b7the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may not accept data from studies with clinical trial sites in foreign countries;\n\uf0b7the FDA may require that we conduct additional pre-clinical or clinical studies, change our manufacturing process, or gather additional manufacturing information above what we currently have planned for;\n\uf0b7the FDA\u2019s interpretation and our interpretation of data from pre-clinical studies and clinical trials may differ significantly;\n\uf0b7the FDA may not agree with our intended indications, the design of our clinical or pre-clinical studies, or there may be a flaw in the design that does not become apparent until the studies are well advanced;\n\uf0b7we may not be able to establish agreements with contractors or collaborators, including clinical trial sites and CROs, or they or we may fail to comply with applicable FDA, protocol, and other regulatory requirements, including those identified in other risk factors;\n\uf0b7the FDA may not approve the manufacturing processes or facilities;\n\uf0b7the FDA may change its approval policies or adopt new laws, guidance, or regulations and our development program may not meet newly imposed requirements. By example, FDA has issued guidance on the development of drug products for the treatment cancer, including a draft guidance specifically concerning AML and hematological malignancies;\n\uf0b7the cost of clinical trials of our product candidates may be greater than we anticipate or we may have insufficient funds for a clinical trial or to pay the substantial user fees required by the FDA upon the filing of a marketing application; or\n\uf0b7the FDA may not accept an NDA or other submission due to, among other reasons, the content or formatting of the submission.\nOur pre-clinical and clinical data, other information and procedures relating to a drug candidate may not be sufficient to support approval by the FDA or any other U.S. or foreign regulatory authority, or regulatory interpretation of these data and procedures may be unfavorable. Our efforts to take advantage of expedited regulatory pathways for serious or life-threatening illnesses, such as accelerated approval, to secure marketing authorization more quickly may not be successful. We cannot be certain that any NDA we submit will be approved by the FDA for full or accelerated approval on a timely basis, if at all. Securing accelerated approval requires demonstrating a meaningful therapeutic benefit over available existing treatments. Accelerated approvals are based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. If approved, the FDA will require post-marketing studies to verify clinical benefit. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit, will allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. We plan to seek FDA marketing approval of zandelisib via the accelerated approval pathway, based on the results of our ongoing phase 2 clinical trial. The FDA, however, may not agree that the accelerated approval pathway is appropriate, may disagree with our chosen surrogate endpoints, or may find that the accelerated approval criteria are not met. Should the FDA disagree with our approach, we would be required to conduct additional clinical studies prior to submitting an NDA and prior to the FDA granting marketing approval. Should we receive accelerated approval for zandelisib, the FDA-approved label will indicate that the clinical benefit of the product has not been established and that continued approval is contingent upon verification of a clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.\nOur business and reputation may be harmed by any failure or significant delay in receiving regulatory approval for the sale of any drugs resulting from our drug candidates. As a result, we cannot predict when or whether regulatory approval will be obtained for any drug we develop. Additionally, other factors may serve to delay, limit or prevent the final approval by regulatory authorities of our drug candidates for commercial use, including, but not limited to:\n\uf0b7Zandelisib, voruciclib, ME-344, and pracinostat are in various stages of development, and we or our licensees will need to conduct significant clinical testing and development work to demonstrate the quality, safety, and efficacy of these drug candidates before applications for marketing can be filed with the FDA, or with the regulatory authorities of other countries;\n\uf0b7development and testing of product formulation, including identification of suitable excipients, or chemical additives intended to facilitate delivery of our drug candidates;\n\uf0b7it may take us many years to complete the testing of our drug candidates, and failure can occur at any stage of this process; and\n\uf0b7negative or inconclusive results, statistically or clinically insignificant results, or adverse medical events during a clinical trial could cause us to delay or terminate our development efforts.\nSignificant delays relating to any preclinical or clinical trials also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do. This may prevent us from receiving marketing approvals and impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and may harm our business and results of operations. If we experience delays in obtaining approval, if we fail to obtain approval of a product candidate or if the label for a\nproduct candidate does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that product candidate, the commercial prospects for such product candidate may be harmed and our ability to generate revenues from that product candidate will be materially impaired. Accordingly, the successful development of any of our drug candidates is uncertain and, accordingly, we may never commercialize any of these drug candidates or generate significant revenue.\nThe FDA may determine that our drug candidates have undesirable side effects that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval or commercialization.\nUndesirable side effects caused by our drug candidates could cause us, IRBs, and other reviewing entities or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay, or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other comparable foreign authorities. Undesirable side effects may also result in requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance, or other requirements, including REMS, to monitor the safety or efficacy of the products. These could prevent us from commercializing and generating revenues from the sale of our drug candidates.\nMany compounds that initially showed promise in clinical or earlier stage testing have later been found to cause side effects that prevented further development of the compound. In addition, adverse events which had initially been considered unrelated to the study treatment may later be found to be caused by the study treatment. Moreover, incorrect or improper use of our drug candidates could cause unexpected side effects or adverse events. If any of our drug candidates is associated with serious adverse events or undesirable side effects or have properties that are unexpected, we may need to abandon development or limit development of that drug candidate to certain uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. The therapeutic-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial or result in potential product liability claims. Any of these occurrences may significantly harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nIf we experience delays or difficulties in the enrolment of patients in clinical trials, our completion of clinical trials and receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented.\nWe may not be able to initiate or continue conducting clinical trials for our drug candidates if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials as required by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. Competitors may also have ongoing clinical trials for drug candidates that are intended to treat the same indications as our drug candidates, and patients who would otherwise be eligible for our clinical trials may instead enroll in clinical trials of our competitors\u2019 drug candidates. Patient enrollment is affected by other factors including:\n\uf0b7the size and nature of the patient population;\n\uf0b7the severity of the disease under investigation;\n\uf0b7the existence of current treatments for the indications for which we are conducting clinical trials;\n\uf0b7the eligibility criteria for and design of the clinical trial in question, including factors such as frequency of required assessments, length of the study and ongoing monitoring requirements;\n\uf0b7the perceived risks and benefits of the drug candidate, including the potential advantages or disadvantages of the drug candidate being studied in relation to other available therapies;\n\uf0b7competition in recruiting and enrolling patients in clinical trials;\n\uf0b7efforts to facilitate timely enrolment in clinical trials;\n\uf0b7patient referral practices of physicians;\n\uf0b7effectiveness of publicity created by clinical trial sites regarding the trial;\n\uf0b7patients\u2019 ability to comply with the specific instructions related to the trial protocol, proper documentation, and use of the drug candidate;\n\uf0b7an inability to obtain or maintain patient informed consents;\n\uf0b7the risk that enrolled patients will drop out before completion or not return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\uf0b7the ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment;\n\uf0b7the ability to compensate patients for their time and effort; and\n\uf0b7the proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients.\nOur inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for our clinical trials would result in significant delays and could require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. In particular, there may be low or slow enrollment, and the studies may enroll subjects that do not meet the inclusion criteria, requiring the erroneously enrolled subjects to be excluded and the trial population to be increased. Moreover, patients in our clinical trials may be at risk for dropping out of our studies if they are not experiencing relief of their disease. A significant number of withdrawn patients would compromise the quality of our data.\nEnrollment delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our drug candidates, or the inability to complete development of our drug candidates, which would cause the value of our company to decline, limit our ability to obtain additional financing, and materially impair our ability to generate revenues.\nChanges in funding for the FDA and other government agencies or future government shutdowns could cause delays in the submission and regulatory review of marketing applications, which could negatively impact our business or prospects.\nThe ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept submission, applications, and the payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory, and policy changes. In addition, government funding of other government agencies that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable.\nDisruptions at the FDA and other agencies, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, may also slow the time necessary for new drugs to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. For example, over the last several years, including for 35 days beginning on December 22, 2018, the U.S. government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, had to furlough critical FDA employees and stop critical activities. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs or if agency operations are otherwise impacted, it could significantly affect the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects.\nFailure to obtain regulatory approval in foreign jurisdictions would prevent us from marketing our products internationally.\nWe intend to have our drug candidates marketed outside the United States. In order to market our products in many non-U.S. jurisdictions, we must obtain separate regulatory approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. To date, we have not filed for marketing approval for any of our drug candidates and may not receive the approvals necessary to commercialize our drug candidates in any market.\nThe approval procedure varies among countries and may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. Further, the time required to obtain foreign regulatory approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval, and additional pre-clinical studies, clinical trials, other testing and data review may be required. We may not obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all. Additionally, approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory agencies in other countries, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory agencies in other foreign countries or by the FDA. However, a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one jurisdiction may have a negative effect on the regulatory approval process in other jurisdictions, including approval by the FDA. The failure to obtain regulatory approval in foreign jurisdictions could limit commercialization of our products, reduce our ability to generate profits and harm our business.\nAny designation granted by the FDA for any of our product candidates may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process, and does not increase the likelihood that our product candidates will receive marketing approval. We may also not be able to obtain or maintain any such designation.\nWe currently hold an FDA Fast Track Designation for zandelisib for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma who have received at least two prior systemic therapies. Previously, in August 2016, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to pracinostat for the treatment of AML. However, in July 2020, we announced the discontinuation of the Phase 3 clinical trial of pracinostat, conducted by Helsinn, for the treatment of AML. The FDA also withdrew the pracinostat breakthrough designation. As described in the Government Regulation section of this Annual Report, there are a number of FDA programs that are intended to speed the development of drugs that are intended to treat serious diseases and conditions when there is an unmet need, including Fast Track and Break Through Therapy Designation. Receipt of such designations is within the discretion of the FDA. Accordingly, even if we believe one of our drug candidates meets the criteria for a designation, the FDA may disagree. If we receive any designation, the potential reduced timelines associated with designation may introduce significant chemistry, manufacturing and controls challenges for product development as manufacturing development may need to take place at a faster pace than would otherwise be required because the FDA will expect that properly qualified and manufactured product be available at the time of product approval. In any event, the receipt of a designation for a product candidate may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and does not assure ultimate approval by the FDA. In addition, even after granting a designation, the FDA may later decide that such product candidates no longer meet the conditions for qualification and rescind such designations.\nAny orphan drug designations we receive may not confer marketing exclusivity or other benefits.\nIn the United States, under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition. Such diseases and conditions are those that affect fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if they affect more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug\navailable in the United States for these types of diseases or conditions will be recovered from sales of the drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. If the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by that agency. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process, but it can lead to financial incentives, such as opportunities for grant funding toward clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. The EMA and the UK also have programs for orphan drugs.\nThere is no guarantee that a drug candidate will receive orphan drug designation. There is also no guarantee that we would be able to maintain any designations that we receive. For instance, orphan drug designation in the U.S., EU or UK may be revoked for a number of reasons. If a drug that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the drug is entitled to orphan drug marketing exclusivity for a period of seven years. Orphan drug marketing exclusivity generally prevents the FDA from approving another application, including a full NDA, to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, including if the FDA concludes that the later drug is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. For purposes of small molecule drugs, the FDA defines \u201csame drug\u201d as a drug that contains the same active moiety and is intended for the same use as the drug in question. We may not be able to obtain future orphan drug designations that we may apply for or maintain any orphan drug designations that we may receive. A designated orphan drug also may not receive orphan drug marketing exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation or if it is deemed to be the same drug as a previously approved drug and cannot demonstrate clinical superiority. Similarly, in the EMA (and the MHRA), orphan drugs can receive an exclusivity period of ten years, but can be reduced to six years if the drug no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation or if the drug is sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is no longer justified. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. By example, we received FDA and EMA orphan drug designation for pracinostat for the treatment of AML. However, in July 2020, we announced the discontinuation of the Phase 3 clinical trial of pracinostat, conducted by Helsinn, for the treatment of AML.\nOrphan drug exclusivity may be lost if the FDA, EMA or MHRA determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. Orphan drug exclusivity also may not protect a product from competition. For instance, the FDA may approve a drug that is the same drug with orphan exclusivity for a different indication or a different drug for the same indication as the orphan product. Even after an orphan product is approved, the FDA can also subsequently approve a product containing the same principal molecular features for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the latter product is clinically superior. The FDA may further grant orphan designation to multiple sponsors for the same compound or active molecule and for the same indication. If another sponsor receives FDA approval for such product before we do, we would be prevented from launching our product in the United States for the orphan indication for a period of at least seven years unless we can demonstrate clinical superiority.\nRisks Related to the Commercialization of Our Drug Candidates\nEven if we or our licensees receive regulatory approval to commercialize our drug candidates, our ability to generate revenues from any resulting products will be subject to a variety of risks, many of which are out of our control.\nEven if our drug candidates obtain regulatory approval, resulting products may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payers or the medical community. We believe that the degree of market acceptance and our ability to generate revenues from such products will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\uf0b7timing of market introduction of our drugs and competitive drugs;\n\uf0b7actual and perceived efficacy and safety of our drug candidates;\n\uf0b7prevalence and severity of any side effects;\n\uf0b7potential or perceived advantages or disadvantages over alternative treatments;\n\uf0b7potential post-marketing commitments imposed by regulatory authorities, such as patient registries;\n\uf0b7strength of sales, marketing and distribution support;\n\uf0b7price of our future products, both in absolute terms and relative to alternative treatments;\n\uf0b7the effect of current and future healthcare laws on our drug candidates; and\n\uf0b7availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payers.\nIf any of our drugs are approved and fail to achieve market acceptance, we may not be able to generate significant revenue to achieve or sustain profitability.\nIf any products we develop become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, our ability to successfully commercialize our products will be impaired.\nOur future revenues, profitability and access to capital will be affected by the continuing efforts of governmental and private third-party payers to manage, contain or reduce the costs of health care through various means, such as capping prices, limiting price increases, reducing reimbursement, and requiring rebates. We are also unsure of the impact of any future health care reform legislation or other changes in healthcare policy may have on our business or what actions federal, state, foreign and private payers may take or reforms that may be implemented in the future. Therefore, it is difficult to predict the effect of any potential reform on our business. Our ability to commercialize our drug candidates successfully will depend, in part, on the extent to which reimbursement for the cost of such drug candidates and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, such as Medicare and Medicaid in the United States, private health insurers and other organizations. Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products, particularly for indications for which there is no current effective treatment or for which medical care typically is not sought. Adequate third-party coverage may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in research and development. If adequate coverage and reimbursement levels are not provided by government and third-party payers for use of our products, our products may fail to achieve market acceptance without a substantial reduction in price or at all and our results of operations will be harmed. In addition, government regulation may restrict our business and financial relationships with health care providers and managed care intermediaries in ways that could impact our ability successfully to market our products.\nFurther, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which have resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted bills by Congress and the states designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. In addition, the United States government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement, requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs, and permitting importation of drugs from outside the United States to limit the growth of government paid health care costs. For example, the United States government has passed legislation requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers that participate in federal healthcare programs to provide rebates and discounts to certain entities and governmental payors. Further, Congress and the current administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. Individual states in the United States have also been increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.\nOur drug candidates are subject to ongoing government regulation both before and after regulatory approval.\nBoth before and after regulatory approval, our drug candidates are subject to strict and ongoing regulation. Compliance with such regulations may consume substantial financial and management resources and expose us and our collaborators to the potential for other adverse circumstances. For example, a regulatory authority can place restrictions on the sale or marketing of a drug in order to manage the risks identified during initial clinical trials or after the drug is on the market. A regulatory authority can condition the approval for a drug on costly post-marketing follow-up studies. Based on these studies, if a regulatory authority does not believe that the drug demonstrates a clinical benefit to patients or an acceptable safety profile, it could limit the indications for which a drug may be sold or revoke the drug\u2019s marketing approval. In addition, identification of certain side effects either during clinical trials or after a drug is on the market may result in reformulation of a drug, additional pre-clinical and clinical trials, labeling changes, termination of ongoing clinical trials or withdrawal of approval. Any of these events could delay or prevent us from generating revenue from the commercialization of these drugs and cause us to incur significant additional costs.\nCompliance with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in significant expenses and we and our third-party contractors and collaborators may be subject to unannounced FDA and other regulatory authority inspections. Any failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements or problems with our drug candidates may result in regulatory enforcement or other actions, including:\n\uf0b7restrictions on manufacturing or distribution, or marketing of any approved products;\n\uf0b7restrictions on the labeling, including restrictions on the indication or approved patient population, and required additional warnings, such as black box warnings, contraindications, and precautions;\n\uf0b7modifications to promotional pieces or issuance of corrective information;\n\uf0b7requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or other clinical trials;\n\uf0b7clinical holds or termination of clinical trials;\n\uf0b7requirements to establish or modify a REMS or a comparable foreign authority may require that we establish or modify a similar strategy;\n\uf0b7changes to the way the product is administered;\n\uf0b7liability for harm caused to patients or subjects;\n\uf0b7reputational harm;\n\uf0b7the product becoming less competitive;\n\uf0b7warning, untitled, or cyber letters;\n\uf0b7suspension of marketing or withdrawal of the products from the market;\n\uf0b7regulatory authority issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases, or other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product;\n\uf0b7refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n\uf0b7recalls of products;\n\uf0b7fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenues;\n\uf0b7suspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals;\n\uf0b7refusal to permit the import or export of our products;\n\uf0b7product seizure or detention;\n\uf0b7FDA debarment, suspension and debarment from government contracts, and refusal of orders under existing government contracts, exclusion from federal healthcare programs, consent decrees, or corporate integrity agreements; or\n\uf0b7injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties, including imprisonment.\nNon-compliance with any foreign jurisdictions\u2019 requirements, including requirements regarding the protection of personal information, can also lead to significant penalties and sanctions.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining regulatory product approval and market acceptance of the particular drug candidate, if approved, or could substantially increase the costs and expenses of developing and commercializing such product, which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating significant revenues from its sale.\nOther changes may also impact our ability to conduct studies and the approvability or marketability of our drug candidates, including changes in law, government regulation, or FDA policy, including review policies, which may be due to changes in the U.S. government and U.S. administration, or changes in medical practice or standard of care.\nIf we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements, standards of care, or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and be subject to regulatory enforcement action. Should any of the above actions take place, they could adversely affect our ability to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe may not be able to establish the contractual arrangements necessary to develop, market and distribute our drug candidates.\nA key part of our strategy is to establish contractual relationships with third parties to package, market and distribute our drug candidates. There is no assurance that we will be able to negotiate commercially acceptable licensing or other agreements for the future exploitation of our drug candidates, including continued clinical development, manufacture or marketing. If we are unable to successfully contract for these services, or if arrangements for these services are terminated, we may have to delay our commercialization program which will adversely affect our ability to generate operating revenues.\nOur commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated if competitors develop and market products that are more effective, have fewer side effects or are less expensive than our drug candidates.\nThe development of drug candidates is highly competitive. A number of other companies have products or drug candidates that have either been approved or are in various stages of pre-clinical or clinical development that are intended for the same therapeutic indications for which our drug candidates are being developed. Some of these potential competing drug candidates are further advanced in development than our drug candidates and may be commercialized sooner. Even if we are successful in developing effective drugs, our compounds may not compete successfully with products produced by our competitors.\nOur competitors include pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies, as well as universities and public and private research institutions. In addition, companies active in different but related fields represent substantial competition for us. Many of our competitors developing oncology drugs have significantly greater capital resources, larger research and development staffs and facilities and greater experience in drug development, regulation, manufacturing and marketing than we do. These organizations also compete with us and our service providers, to recruit qualified personnel, and with us to attract partners for joint ventures and to license technologies that are competitive with us. As a result, our competitors may be able to more easily develop technologies and products that would render our technologies or our drug candidates obsolete or non-competitive.\nOur product candidates may face competition sooner than anticipated.\nOur product candidates, if approved, may face competition from other products that are the same as or similar to our product candidates. If the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities approve generic or similar versions of any of our product candidates that receive\nmarketing approval, or such authorities do not grant our products appropriate periods of regulatory exclusivity before approving generic or similar versions of our products, the sales of our products could be adversely affected.\nOnce an NDA is approved, the product will become a \u201creference listed drug\u201d in the FDA\u2019s Orange Book. Other applicants may then seek approval of generic versions of our products through submission of Abbreviated New Drug Applications (\"ANDA\") in the United States. Generic products may be significantly less costly to bring to market than the reference listed drug and companies that produce generic products are generally able to offer them at lower prices, and are generally preferred by third party payors. As a result, the FDA, the administration and Congress have recently taken steps to encourage increased generic drug competition in the market in an effort to bring down drug costs. Following the introduction of a generic drug, a significant percentage of the sales of any branded product or reference listed drug is typically lost to the generic product. Moreover, in addition to generic competition, we could face competition from other companies seeking approval of drug products that are similar to ours using the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. Such applicants may be able to rely on our product candidates, if approved, or other approved drug products or published literature to develop drug products that are similar to ours. The introduction of a drug product similar to our product candidates could expose us to increased competition.\nAny ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicants seeking to rely upon any of our product candidates, if such product candidates are approved, would need to submit patent certification statements with their applications for any of our patents that are listed in the FDA\u2019s Orange Book. There are detailed rules and requirements regarding the patents that may be submitted to the FDA for listing in the Orange Book. We may be unable to obtain patents covering our product candidates that contain one or more claims that satisfy the requirements for listing in the Orange Book. If one of our product candidates is approved and a patent covering that product candidate is not listed in the Orange Book, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant would not have to submit a patent certification with regard to such patent to the FDA, in which case, we would not receive the protections provided by the Hatch Waxman Act.\nMoreover, if an ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant files a paragraph IV challenge to any patents that we may list in the FDA\u2019s Orange Book and if we do not file a timely patent infringement lawsuit, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant would not be subject to a 30-month stay. If we did file such an action, the litigation or other proceedings to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights would likely be complex in nature, may be expensive and time consuming, may divert our management\u2019s attention from our core business, and may result in unfavorable results that could adversely impact our ability to prevent third parties from competing with our products. Accordingly, upon approval of our product candidates we may be subject to generic competition or competition from similar products, or may need to commence patent infringement proceedings, which would divert our resources.\nWe currently anticipate that we may be eligible for five years of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States. This exclusivity, however, would not prevent other companies from submitting full NDAs. To the extent we do not receive any anticipated periods of regulatory exclusivity or to the extent the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities approve any generic, similar, or other competing products, our business would be adversely impacted. Competition that our products may face from generic, similar, or other competing products could materially and adversely impact our future revenue, profitability, and cash flows and substantially limit our ability to obtain a return on the investments we have made in those product candidates.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials and pre-clinical studies. If those parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, our drug candidates may not advance in a timely manner or at all.\nIn the course of our pre-clinical testing and clinical trials, we rely on third parties, including laboratories, investigators, clinical contract research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d), manufacturers, and distributors to perform critical services for us. For example, we rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials and many of our pre-clinical studies, which are required to be conducted consistent with regulations on GLPs and GCPs. CROs and study sites are responsible for many aspects of the trials, including finding and enrolling subjects for testing and administering the trials. Although we rely on these third parties to conduct our pre-clinical and clinical trials, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our trials is conducted in accordance with its investigational plan and protocol and that the integrity of the studies and resulting data is protected. While we have agreements governing the activities of such third parties, we have limited influence and control over their actual performance and activities. Moreover, the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities require us to comply with regulations and standards, commonly referred to as GCPs, for conducting, monitoring, recording, and reporting the results of clinical trials to ensure that the data and results are scientifically credible and accurate, and that the trial subjects are adequately informed of the potential risks of participating in clinical trials. Our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements. These third parties may not be available when we need them or, if they are available, may not devote sufficient time or resources to our studies, may not comply with all regulatory and contractual requirements, or may not otherwise perform their services in a timely or acceptable manner, and we may need to enter into new arrangements with alternative third parties and our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated. These independent third parties may also have relationships with other commercial entities, some of which may compete with us. In addition, if such third parties fail to perform their obligations in compliance with our protocols or the applicable regulatory requirements, our trials may not meet regulatory requirements or may need to be repeated, we may not receive marketing approvals, or we or such third parties may face regulatory enforcement.\nAgreements with third parties conducting or otherwise assisting with our clinical or preclinical studies might terminate for a variety of reasons, including a failure to perform by the third parties. If any of our relationships with these third parties terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative providers or to do so on commercially reasonable terms. Switching or adding additional third parties involves additional cost and requires management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new third party commences work. As a result, if we need to enter into alternative arrangements, it could delay our product development activities and adversely affect our business. Though we carefully manage our relationships with our third parties, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects, and results of operations.\nAccordingly, as a result of our dependence on third parties, we may face delays, failures or cost increases outside of our direct control. These risks also apply to the development activities of collaborators, and we do not control their research and development, clinical trial or regulatory activities.\nIn addition, we will be required to report certain financial interests of our third-party investigators if these relationships exceed certain financial thresholds or meet other criteria. The FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may question the integrity of the data from those clinical trials conducted by investigators who may have conflicts of interest.\nWe also cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our trials complies with the applicable regulatory requirements. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with drug candidates that were produced under cGMP conditions. Failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. We also are required to register certain clinical trials and post the results of certain completed clinical trials on a government-sponsored database, ClinicalTrials.gov, within specified timeframes. Failure to do so can result in enforcement actions and adverse publicity.\nWe will depend on third party suppliers and contract manufacturers for the manufacturing of our drug candidates and have no direct control over the cost of manufacturing our drug candidates. Increases in the cost of manufacturing our drug candidates would increase our costs of conducting clinical trials and could adversely affect our future profitability.\nWe do not intend to manufacture our drug candidates ourselves, and we will rely on third parties for our drug supplies both for clinical trials and for commercial quantities in the future. We have taken the strategic decision not to manufacture active pharmaceutical ingredients (\u201cAPI\u201d), nor finished product, for our drug candidates, as these can be more economically supplied by third parties with particular expertise in this area. We have identified contract facilities that are registered with the FDA, have a track record of large- scale API and drug product manufacturing, and have already invested in capital and equipment. We have no direct control over the manufacturing of our drug candidates, or the cost thereof. If the contract manufacturers are unable to produce sufficient quantities of our drug candidates, as a result of a lack of available materials or otherwise, our ability to complete product candidate development and our future profitability would be adversely affected. If the cost of manufacturing increases, or if the cost of the materials used increases, these costs will be passed on to us, making the cost of conducting clinical trials more expensive. Increases in manufacturing costs could adversely affect our future profitability if we are unable to pass all of the increased costs along to our customers.\nIf these third-party manufacturers do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or manufacture our drug candidates in accordance with regulatory requirements, if there are disagreements between us and such parties, or if such parties are unable to expand capacities to support commercialization of any of our drug candidates for which we obtain marketing approval, we may not be able to produce, or may be delayed in producing sufficient drug candidates to meet our supply requirements. Any delays in obtaining adequate supplies with respect to our drug candidates and components may delay the development or commercialization of our drug candidates.\nFurther, we, along with our contract manufacturers, are required to comply with FDA requirements for cGMPs, related to product testing, quality assurance, manufacturing and documentation. Our contract manufacturers may not be able to comply with the applicable FDA regulatory requirements, which could result in delays to our product development programs, could result in adverse regulatory actions against them or us, and could prevent us from ultimately receiving product marketing approval. They also generally must pass an FDA preapproval inspection for conformity with cGMPs before we can obtain approval to manufacture our drug candidates and will be subject to ongoing, periodic, unannounced inspection by the FDA and corresponding state agencies to ensure strict compliance with cGMP, and other applicable government regulations and corresponding foreign standards. If we and our contract manufacturers fail to achieve and maintain high manufacturing standards in compliance with cGMP, we may experience manufacturing errors resulting in defective products that could be harmful to patients, product recalls or withdrawals, delays or interruptions of production or failures in product testing or delivery, clinical trial or other development program delays, delay or prevention of filing or approval of marketing applications for our products, cost overruns or other problems that could seriously harm our business. Not complying with FDA requirements could result in a product recall, costly and time-consuming corrective or preventative actions, or prevent commercialization of our drug candidates and delay our business development activities. In addition, such failure could be the basis for the FDA to issue a warning or untitled letter or take other regulatory or legal\nenforcement action, including recall or seizure, total or partial suspension of production, suspension of ongoing clinical trials, refusal to approve pending applications or supplemental applications, and potentially civil and/or criminal penalties depending on the matter.\nIf we need to replace any of our manufacturers or establish additional manufacturing arrangements, we may not succeed in our efforts. Our drug candidates may compete with other products and drug candidates for access to manufacturing facilities. There are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under cGMP regulations and that are both capable of manufacturing for us and willing to do so. If our existing third-party manufacturers, or the third parties that we engage in the future to manufacture a product or component for commercial sale or for our clinical trials should cease to continue to do so for any reason, we likely would experience delays in obtaining sufficient quantities of our drug candidates for us to meet commercial demand or to advance our clinical trials while we identify and qualify replacement suppliers. These third-party facilities may also be affected by natural disasters, such as floods or fire, or such facilities could face manufacturing issues, such as contamination or regulatory findings following a regulatory inspection of such facility. In such instances, we may need to locate an appropriate replacement third-party relationship, which may not be readily available or on acceptable terms, which would cause additional delay and increased expense. The addition of a new or alternative manufacturer may also require FDA approvals and may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe or our third-party manufacturers may also encounter shortages in the raw materials, therapeutic substances, or active pharmaceutical ingredients necessary to produce our drug candidates in the quantities needed for our clinical trials or, if our drug candidates are approved, in sufficient quantities for commercialization or to meet an increase in demand. Such shortages may occur for a variety of reasons, including capacity constraints, delays or disruptions in the market, and shortages caused by the purchase of such materials by our competitors or others. Our or our third-party manufacturers\u2019 failure to obtain the raw materials, therapeutic substances, or active pharmaceutical ingredients necessary to manufacture sufficient quantities of our drug candidates may have a material adverse effect on our business. If for any reason we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of our drug candidates or the components used to manufacture them, it will be more difficult for us to develop our drug candidates and compete effectively.\nWe rely on acquisitions or licenses from third parties to expand our pipeline of drug candidates.\nWe are not presently engaged in drug discovery activities. In order to expand our pipeline of drug candidates for future development, we may need to purchase or in-license any such drug candidates. The success of this strategy depends in large part on the combination of our regulatory and development capabilities and expertise and our ability to identify, select and acquire or in-license clinically-enabled product candidates on terms that are acceptable to us. Identifying, selecting and acquiring or in-licensing promising product candidates requires substantial technical expertise, and we have limited experience in identifying and integrating any acquired product candidates into our current infrastructure. Efforts to do so may not result in the actual acquisition or in-license of a particular drug candidate, potentially resulting in a diversion of our management\u2019s time and the expenditure of our resources with no resulting benefit. If we are unable to identify, select and acquire or license suitable product candidates from third parties on terms acceptable to us, our business and prospects may be limited.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nOur commercial success is dependent, in part, on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and preserving trade secrets, which cannot be guaranteed.\nPatent protection and trade secret protection are important to our business and our future will depend, in part on our ability to maintain trade secret protection, obtain patents and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others both in the United States and abroad. Litigation or other legal proceedings may be necessary to defend against claims of infringement, to enforce our patents or to protect our trade secrets. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of our management\u2019s attention.\nThe patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. In September 2013, we acquired patents and patent applications related to zandelisib from Pathway Therapeutics, Inc. In September 2017, we acquired patents and patent applications related to voruciclib from Presage. In 2011, we acquired both issued patents and pending patent applications related to ME-344 from Novogen in relation to our Isoflavone-based compounds, which we previously licensed from Novogen. Additionally, Novogen had previously applied for patents in a number of countries with respect to the use of their isoflavone compounds, including ME-344. The patent applications may not proceed to grant or may be amended to reduce the scope of protection of any patent granted. The applications and patents may also be opposed or challenged by third parties. Our commercial success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain effective patent protection for our compounds and their use in treating, preventing, or curing cancer, and to successfully defend patent rights in those technologies against third-party challenges. As patent applications in the United States are maintained in secrecy until published or issued and as publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that we or Presage were the first to make the inventions covered by the pending patent applications or issued patents referred to above or that we or they were the first to file patent applications for such inventions. Additionally, the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology and pharmaceutical patents or their enforceability cannot be predicted. We cannot be sure that, should any patents issue, we will be provided with adequate protection against potentially competitive products. Furthermore, we cannot be sure that should\npatents issue, they will be of commercial value to us, or that private parties, including competitors, will not successfully challenge our patents or circumvent our patent position in the United States or abroad.\nClaims by other companies that we infringe on their proprietary technology may result in liability for damages or stop our development and commercialization efforts.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive, and patents have been applied for by, and issued to, other parties relating to products competitive with the compounds that we have acquired. Therefore, zandelisib, voruciclib, ME-344 and pracinostat, and any other drug candidates, may give rise to claims that they infringe the patents or proprietary rights of other parties existing now and in the future.\nFurthermore, to the extent that we or our consultants or research collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in work performed for us, disputes may also arise as to the rights in such intellectual property or in resulting know-how and inventions. An adverse claim could subject us to significant liabilities to such other parties and/or require disputed rights to be licensed from such other parties.\nWe have contracted formulation development and manufacturing process development work for our product candidates. This process has identified a number of excipients, or additives to improve drug delivery, which may be used in the formulations. Excipients, among other things, perform the function of a carrier of the active drug ingredient. Some of these identified excipients or carriers may be included in third party patents in some countries. We intend to seek a license if we decide to use a patented excipient in the marketed product or we may choose one of those excipients that does not have a license requirement.\nWe cannot be sure that any license required under any such patents or proprietary rights would be made available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we do not obtain such licenses, we may encounter delays in product market introductions, or may find that the development, manufacture or sale of products requiring such licenses may be precluded.\nWe may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that our employees or we have misappropriated their intellectual property, or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nMany of our employees and the employees of KKC and third parties upon which we rely to conduct our clinical trials were previously employed at universities or at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, some of which may be competitors or potential competitors. Some of these employees executed proprietary rights, non-disclosure and non-competition agreements, or similar agreements, in connection with such previous employment. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such third party. Litigation may be necessary to defend against such claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel or sustain damages. Such intellectual property rights could be awarded to a third party, and we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to commercialize our technology or products. Such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIn addition, while we typically require our employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we regard as our own, which may result in claims by or against us related to the ownership of such intellectual property. If we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights. Even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to our senior management and scientific personnel.\nWe may be subject to substantial costs stemming from our defense against third-party intellectual property infringement claims.\nThird parties may assert that we are using their proprietary information without authorization. Third parties may also have or obtain patents and may claim that technologies licensed to or used by us infringe their patents. If we are required to defend patent infringement actions brought by third parties, or if we sue to protect our own patent rights, we may be required to pay substantial litigation costs and managerial attention may be diverted from business operations even if the outcome is not adverse to us. In addition, any legal action that seeks damages or an injunction to stop us from carrying on our commercial activities relating to the affected technologies could subject us to monetary liability and require us or any third party licensors to obtain a license to continue to use the affected technologies. We cannot predict whether we would prevail in any of these types of actions or that any required license would be made available on commercially acceptable terms or at all.\nGeneral Business Risks\nWe face a risk of product liability claims and claims may exceed our insurance limits.\nOur business exposes us to the risk of product liability claims. This risk is inherent in the manufacturing, testing and marketing of human therapeutic products. Moreover, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims can have other adverse consequences, including:\n\uf0b7loss of revenue from decreased demand for our products and/or drug candidates;\n\uf0b7impairment of our business reputation or financial stability;\n\uf0b7costs of related litigation;\n\uf0b7substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants;\n\uf0b7diversion of management attention;\n\uf0b7withdrawal of clinical trial participants and potential termination of clinical trial sites or entire clinical programs;\n\uf0b7the inability to commercialize our drug candidates;\n\uf0b7significant negative media attention;\n\uf0b7decrease in our stock price; or\n\uf0b7initiation of investigations, and enforcement actions by regulators; and product recalls, withdrawals, revocation of approvals, or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions.\nOur product liability insurance coverage is subject to deductibles and coverage limitations. We may not be able to obtain or maintain adequate protection against potential liabilities, or claims may exceed our insurance limits. If we cannot or do not sufficiently insure against potential product liability claims, we may be exposed to significant liabilities, which may materially and adversely affect our business development and commercialization efforts.\nOur employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial partners, principal investigators, or CROs may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial partners, manufacturers, investigators, or CROs could include intentional, reckless, negligent, or unintentional failures to comply with FDA regulations, comply with applicable fraud and abuse laws, provide accurate information to the FDA, properly calculate pricing information required by federal programs, comply with federal procurement rules or contract terms, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. This misconduct could also involve the improper use or misrepresentation of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter this type of misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. Moreover, it is possible for a whistleblower to pursue a False Claims Act, (\u201cFCA\u201d), case against us even if the government considers the claim unmeritorious and declines to intervene, which could require us to incur costs defending against such a claim. Further, due to the risk that a judgment in an FCA case could result in exclusion from federal health programs or debarment from government contracts, whistleblower cases often result in large settlements. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures.\nOur internal computer systems and those of our CROs and other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication and electrical failures. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our drug candidate development and, if such drug candidates are approved commercialization programs. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed, ongoing or planned clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of personal, confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and regulatory enforcement actions, and the further development of any of our drug candidates could be delayed.\nOur efforts will be seriously jeopardized if we are unable to retain and attract key employees.\nOur success depends on the continued contributions of our principal management, development and scientific personnel. We face competition for such personnel, and we believe that risks and uncertainties related to our business, including the timing and risk associated with research and development, our available and anticipated cash resources, and the volatility of our stock price, may impact our ability to hire and retain key and other personnel. The loss of services of our Chief Executive Officer or other key employees could adversely impact our operations and ability to generate or raise additional capital.\nNegative U.S. and global economic conditions may pose challenges to our business strategy, which relies on funding from the financial markets or collaborators.\nNegative conditions in the U.S. or global economy, including financial markets, may adversely affect our business and the business of current and prospective vendors, licensees and collaborators, and others with whom we do or may conduct business. The duration and severity of these conditions is uncertain. If negative economic conditions occur, we may be unable to secure funding on terms satisfactory to us to sustain our operations or to find suitable collaborators to advance our internal programs, even if we achieve positive results from our drug development programs.\nLaws, rules and regulations relating to public companies may be costly and impact our ability to attract and retain directors and executive officers.\nLaws and regulations affecting public companies, including rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) and by the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d), may result in increased costs to us. These laws, rules and regulations could make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, on our board committees or as executive officers. We cannot estimate accurately the amount or timing of additional costs we may incur to respond to these laws, rules and regulations.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired, which would adversely affect our operating results, our ability to operate our business, and our stock price, and could result in litigation or similar actions.\nEnsuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently. Failure on our part to have effective internal financial and accounting controls would cause our financial reporting to be unreliable, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition, and could cause the trading price of our common stock to fall dramatically. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company will be detected.\nWe cannot be certain that the actions we have taken to ensure we have adequate internal controls over financial reporting will be sufficient. In future periods, if the process required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act reveals any material weaknesses or significant deficiencies, the correction of any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies could require remedial measures which could be costly and time-consuming. In addition, in such a case, we may be unable to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis. Any associated accounting restatement could create a significant strain on our internal resources and cause delays in our release of quarterly or annual financial results and the filing of related reports, increase our costs and cause management distraction. Any of the foregoing could cause investors to lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline and make it more difficult for us to finance our operations and growth.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our suppliers, as well as personally identifiable information of clinical trial participants and employees. Similarly, our third-party providers possess certain of our sensitive protected health data. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Attacks of this nature are increasing in their frequency, levels of persistence, sophistication and intensity, and are being conducted by sophisticated and organized groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise. Although we develop and maintain systems and controls designed to prevent these events from occurring, and we have a process to identify and mitigate threats, the development and maintenance of these systems, controls and processes is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated, and such systems, controls and processes may not be successful in preventing a breach. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. We could be required to expend significant amounts of money\nand other resources to repair or replace information systems or networks. In addition, our liability insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyberattacks and other related breaches.\nThe legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing amount of focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect our business, including compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and state laws requiring security breach notification. The collection and use of personal health data of individuals in the European Union is also governed by strict data protection laws. In addition to existing laws, since May 25, 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) has imposed obligations with respect to European Union data and substantial fines for breaches of the data protection rules. It will increase our responsibility and potential liability in relation to personal data that we process, and we will be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new European Union data protection rules. There is significant uncertainty related to the manner in which data protection authorities will seek to enforce compliance with GDPR. For example, it is not clear if the authorities will conduct random audits of companies doing business in the European Union, or if the authorities will wait for complaints to be filed by individuals who claim their rights have been violated. Enforcement uncertainty and the costs associated with ensuring GDPR compliance may be onerous and adversely affect our business, operating results, prospects and financial condition.\nWe are in the process of assessing the \u201cSchrems II\u201d decision issued by the Court of Justice of the European Union on July 16, 2020, and its impact on our data transfer mechanisms. The Court invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as a legal basis for the transfer of personal data from the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d) member states or the U.K. to the U.S. The Court also expressed uncertainty under which conditions data importers and exporters could use the EC\u2019s Standard Contractual Clauses option under the GDPR as a method for transferring personal data outside of the EEA. On June 4, 2021 the European Commission issued new standard contractual clauses for data transfers out of the EU to the third countries with \u201cinadequate data protection\u201d such as the United States. However, there is an implementation period of 18 months for these new standard contractual clauses. It remains uncertain, how these standard contractual clauses will be implemented by the data exporters and data importers. MEI observes the developments and will agree to the appropriate data transfer mechanism. In particular, we may rely on individual contents of the patients where appropriate and necessary to safeguard the data flow from the EU to the United States. Present solutions to legitimize transfers of personal data from the EEA may be challenged or deemed insufficient. We may, in addition to other impacts, experience additional costs associated with increased compliance burdens, and we and our customers face the potential for regulators in the EEA or U.K. to apply different standards to the transfer of personal data from the EEA/ U.K. to the U.S., and to block, or require ad hoc verification of measures taken with respect to, certain data flows from the EEA or U.K. to the U.S. We also may be required to engage in new contract negotiations with third parties that aid in processing data on our behalf. We may experience reluctance or refusal by current or prospective European clinical trial sites and CROs to use our products, and we may find it necessary or desirable to make further changes to our processing of personal data of EEA or U.K. data subjects.\nAdditionally, California has enacted legislation that has been dubbed the first \u201cGDPR-like\u201d law in the United States. Known as the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), it creates new individual privacy rights for consumers (as that word is broadly defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households. The CCPA requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, provide such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales of personal information, and allow for a new cause of action for data breaches. The CCPA may significantly impact our business activities and require substantial compliance costs that adversely affect business, operating results, prospects and financial condition. Amendments to the CCPA mandated by the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d) will impose additional privacy requirements, effective on January 1, 2023. Similarly comprehensive state consumer privacy laws in Virginia and Colorado will also become effective in 2023. These new state privacy measures may reflect the start of a movement in other state legislatures to enact more comprehensive, \u201cGDPR-like\u201d privacy laws, which would create a more complex privacy regulatory landscape for our business in the United States.\nThus, any access, disclosure or other loss of information, including our data being breached at our partners or third-party providers, could result in legal claims or proceedings and liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disrupt our operations and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could harm our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. From time to time and in the future, our operations may involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials, and may also produce hazardous waste. Even if we contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and waste, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from the use or disposal of our hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations.\nWe maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, but this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. However, we do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. In addition, failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nWe or the third parties upon whom we depend may be adversely affected by natural disasters and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster.\nEvents outside of our control, including natural disasters and public health emergencies, could severely disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition. If a natural disaster, or public health emergency such as COVID-19, power outage or other event occurred that prevented us from conducting our clinical trials, including by damaging our critical infrastructure, such as third-party facilities, or that otherwise disrupted operations and travel, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. The disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place may prove inadequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition.\nLimitations on the deductibility of net operating losses could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe have a history of net operating losses. In December 2017, the U.S government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d). The Tax Act limits the deduction of net operating losses to 80% of current year taxable income, however, as a result of the CARES Act, the 80% limitation was temporarily repealed until our fiscal year ending June 30, 2021. The limitations on the net operating loss deduction, as well other changes in tax policy, may subject us to additional taxation, adversely affecting our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Securities Markets and Investment in our Stock\nThe trading price of the shares of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile and could decline in value and we may incur significant costs from class action litigation.\nThe trading price of our common stock could be highly volatile in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\uf0b7failure to successfully develop our drug candidates;\n\uf0b7design, results and timing of clinical trials and pre-clinical studies;\n\uf0b7announcements of technological innovations by us or our competitors;\n\uf0b7new products introduced or announced by us or our competitors;\n\uf0b7changes in financial estimates by securities analysts;\n\uf0b7actual or anticipated variations in operating results;\n\uf0b7expiration or termination of licenses, research contracts or other collaboration agreements;\n\uf0b7conditions or trends in the regulatory climate and the biotechnology, pharmaceutical and genomics industries;\n\uf0b7instability in the stock market as a result of current or future domestic and global events;\n\uf0b7changes in the market valuations of similar companies;\n\uf0b7the liquidity of any market for our securities; and\n\uf0b7threatened or actual delisting of our common stock from a national stock exchange.\nEquity markets in general, and the market for biotechnology and life sciences companies in particular, have experienced substantial price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies traded in those markets. In addition, changes in economic conditions in the U.S., the Europe or globally, particularly in the context of current global events, could impact upon our ability to grow profitably. Adverse economic changes are outside our control and may result in material adverse impacts on our business or our results of operations. These broad market and industry factors may materially affect the market price of shares of our common stock, regardless of our development and operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against that company. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources.\nFuture sales of our common stock, including common stock issued upon exercise of outstanding warrants or options, may depress the market price of our common stock and cause stockholders to experience dilution.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, including upon exercise of outstanding warrants or stock options, and any subsequent sales of such shares. As of June 30, 2021, we had outstanding warrants exercisable to purchase 16,058,985 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $2.54 per share, which expire in May 2023. We also had outstanding options to purchase 16,668,542 shares of common stock and outstanding restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") representing the right to receive 400,650 shares of common stock. We may seek additional capital through one or more additional equity transactions in the future; however, such transactions will be subject to market conditions and there can be no assurance any such transactions will be completed. If we sell shares in the future, the prices at which we sell these future shares will vary, and these variations may be significant. Stockholders will experience significant dilution if we sell these future shares at prices significantly below the price at which such previous stockholders invested.\nBecause we do not intend to pay, and have not paid, any cash dividends on our shares of common stock, our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless the value of our common stock appreciates and they sell their shares.\nWe have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock, and we intend to retain any future earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Therefore, our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their investment unless the value of our common stock appreciates and they sell their shares.\nWe will have broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds from any exercise of outstanding warrants and options.\nWe will have broad discretion to use the net proceeds to us upon any exercise of outstanding warrants and options, and investors in our stock will be relying on the judgment of our board of directors and management regarding the application of these proceeds. Although we expect to use a substantial portion of the net proceeds from any exercise of the warrants and options for general corporate purposes and progression of our clinical trial programs, we have not allocated these net proceeds for specific purposes.\nWe are authorized to issue blank check preferred stock, which could adversely affect the holders of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation allows us to issue blank check preferred stock with rights potentially senior to those of our common stock without any further vote or action by the holders of our common stock. The issuance of a class of preferred stock could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to the holders of our common stock or could adversely affect the rights and powers, including voting rights, of such holders. In certain circumstances, such issuance could have the effect of decreasing the market price of our shares, or making a change in control of the Company more difficult.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and third amended and restated bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and third amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests. We are also subject to anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law, which could delay or prevent a change of control. Together, these provisions may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities. These provisions include:\n\uf0b7a staggered board providing for three classes of directors, which limits the ability of a stockholder or group to gain control of our board;\n\uf0b7no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\uf0b7the right of our board to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board or the resignation, death or removal of a director in certain circumstances, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board; and\n\uf0b7advance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our board or to propose matters to be acted upon at a meeting of stockholders, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nOur third amended and restated bylaws require, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that derivative actions brought in our name, actions against our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders for breach of fiduciary duty and other similar actions may be brought only in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware and, if brought outside of Delaware, the stockholder bringing the suit will be deemed to have consented to service of process on such stockholder\u2019s counsel, which may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders.\nOur third amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder to bring (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Company to the Company or the Company\u2019s stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against the Company, its directors, officers or employees arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against the Company, its directors, officers or employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine, and, if brought outside of Delaware, the stockholder bringing the suit will be deemed to have consented to service of process on such stockholder\u2019s counsel, provided, however, that, in each case, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the forum for such action shall be another state court located within the State of Delaware or, if no state court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware, in all cases subject to the court having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of capital stock of the Company shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to such provisions.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the forum selection provision of our third amended and restated bylaws will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the federal securities laws or any other claim for which the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be the sole and exclusive forum.\nThis choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our third amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur executive officers and directors may sell shares of their stock, and these sales could adversely affect our stock price.\nSales of our stock by our executive officers and directors, or the perception that such sales may occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline or could make it more difficult for us to raise funds through the sale of equity in the future, either as part, or outside, of trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d).", "PERMNO": 89935, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "MEIP"}
